Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于表格问答(TQA)的系统性综述，重点关注基于大语言模型的方法，对任务设置、核心挑战和方法趋势进行了全面梳理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格问答领域虽然在大语言模型推动下取得显著进展，但缺乏对任务定义、核心挑战和方法趋势的系统性组织与理解，特别是在强化学习等新兴研究方向方面。

Method: 提供TQA研究的全面结构化概览，对现有基准和任务设置进行分类，按目标挑战对当前建模策略进行分组，并分析其优缺点。

Result: 建立了TQA研究的统一框架，识别了未充分探索但及时的研究主题，为社区提供了整合基础。

Conclusion: 通过统一分散的研究线索和识别开放问题，本综述为TQA社区提供了巩固的基础，使能更深入理解当前技术水平并指导这一快速发展领域的未来发展。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions
about tabular data, often accompanied by additional contexts such as text
passages. The task spans diverse settings, varying in table representation,
question/answer complexity, modality involved, and domain. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in
TQA, the field still lacks a systematic organization and understanding of task
formulations, core challenges, and methodological trends, particularly in light
of emerging research directions such as reinforcement learning. This survey
addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive and structured overview of TQA
research with a focus on LLM-based methods. We provide a comprehensive
categorization of existing benchmarks and task setups. We group current
modeling strategies according to the challenges they target, and analyze their
strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we highlight underexplored but timely
topics that have not been systematically covered in prior research. By unifying
disparate research threads and identifying open problems, our survey offers a
consolidated foundation for the TQA community, enabling a deeper understanding
of the state of the art and guiding future developments in this rapidly
evolving area.

### [2] [Emotionally Charged, Logically Blurred: AI-driven Emotional Framing Impairs Human Fallacy Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09695)
*Yanran Chen,Lynn Greschner,Roman Klinger,Michael Klenk,Steffen Eger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次计算性地探讨了情感框架与逻辑谬误及说服力的关系，使用大语言模型在保持逻辑结构的同时为谬误论证注入情感诉求，发现情感框架显著降低了人类对谬误的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑谬误在公共传播中普遍存在且容易误导受众，但说服力具有主观性，即使有谬误的论证仍可能显得有说服力。研究旨在探索情感框架如何与谬误和说服力相互作用。

Method: 使用8个大语言模型为谬误论证注入情感诉求同时保持逻辑结构，然后用最佳模型生成刺激材料进行人类研究。

Result: LLM驱动的情感框架使人类谬误检测的F1分数平均降低14.5%。人类在感知愉悦情绪时比恐惧或悲伤时更能检测谬误，这三种情绪相比中性或其他情绪状态与显著更高的说服力相关。

Conclusion: 该研究对AI驱动的谬误论证中的情感操纵具有重要启示意义。

Abstract: Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead
audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking
soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the
first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and
convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change
emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting
emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical
structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our
results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection
in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when
perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also
correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other
emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation
in the context of fallacious argumentation.

*Shin-nosuke Ishikawa,Masato Todo,Taiki Ogihara,Hirotsugu Ohba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd
patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying
regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply
LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through
retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent
frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and
self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and
consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to
maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were
asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from
arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models
successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences,
they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given
numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even
in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini
2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can
be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights
potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical
reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

### [4] [SeCon-RAG: A Two-Stage Semantic Filtering and Conflict-Free Framework for Trustworthy RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09710)
*Xiaonan Si,Meilin Zhu,Simeng Qin,Lijia Yu,Lijun Zhang,Shuaitong Liu,Xinfeng Li,Ranjie Duan,Yang Liu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SeCon-RAG框架，通过两阶段语义过滤和冲突消除机制来防御RAG系统中的语料库污染攻击，在保持有用知识的同时提高生成鲁棒性和输出可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统容易受到语料库污染和污染攻击，现有防御方法通常采用激进过滤，导致有价值信息丢失和生成可靠性降低。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段使用EIRE指导的语义和聚类联合过滤，第二阶段使用EIRE指导的冲突感知过滤模块分析语义一致性。

Result: 在多种LLM和数据集上的实验表明，SeCon-RAG显著优于最先进的防御方法。

Conclusion: SeCon-RAG通过两阶段过滤过程有效保留有用知识同时减轻冲突污染，显著提高了生成鲁棒性和输出可信度。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and
contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses
often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable
information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we
propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for
trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic
and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation
extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity
relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their
semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean
retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided
conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between
the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer
generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could
mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively
preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving
significant improvements in both generation robustness and output
trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets
demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art
defense methods.

### [5] [ReaLM: Residual Quantization Bridging Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09711)
*Wenbin Guo,Xin Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Lingbing Guo,Zhao Li,Zirui Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReaLM是一个新颖的框架，通过残差向量量化将知识图谱嵌入与LLM分词对齐，结合本体指导的类别约束，在知识图谱补全任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的知识图谱补全方法难以充分利用结构化语义表示，因为预训练KG模型的连续嵌入空间与LLM的离散分词空间存在根本性错位，这阻碍了有效的语义迁移并限制了性能。

Method: 使用残差向量量化机制将预训练KG嵌入离散化为紧凑的代码序列，并将其作为可学习分词集成到LLM词汇表中，实现符号知识和上下文知识的无缝融合。同时结合本体指导的类别约束来增强语义一致性。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验表明，ReaLM实现了最先进的性能，证实了其在将结构化知识与大规模语言模型对齐方面的有效性。

Conclusion: ReaLM通过桥接KG嵌入与LLM分词之间的差距，成功地将结构化知识与语言模型对齐，为知识图谱补全提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing
LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic
representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is
fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This
discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance.
To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework
that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the
mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG
embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens
within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual
knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to
enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level
compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its
effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language
models.

### [6] [All Code, No Thought: Current Language Models Struggle to Reason in Ciphered Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09714)
*Shiyuan Guo,Henry Sleight,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，当前AI模型在加密推理方面存在不对称性：虽然能准确翻译加密文本，但在加密推理时准确性显著下降，这可能使加密推理成为逃避思维链监控的无效策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理的广泛采用，检测有害AI行为变得重要。思维链监控是检测对抗性攻击和AI错位的方法，但攻击者和错位模型可能通过加密推理来逃避监控。

Method: 测试28种不同密码，对最多10个模型进行微调和提示，使其在密码中进行推理。使用数学问题准确性作为推理能力的代理指标。

Result: 发现模型准确性在加密推理时显著下降，尽管模型能准确翻译加密文本。前沿模型在知名密码（如rot13）中表现良好，但在较少见密码中表现不佳。加密推理能力与预训练数据中密码的普遍性相关。

Conclusion: 使用加密推理逃避思维链监控对当前模型可能是无效策略，并为约束未来前沿模型发展这种能力提供了指导。

Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect
adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned
models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden
in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test
whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different
ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We
measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability.
Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop
significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate
comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to
English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they
can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered
reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We
also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves
slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT
monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current
models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability
in future frontier models.

### [7] [Preference-Aware Memory Update for Long-Term LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09720)
*Haoran Sun,Zekun Zhang,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了偏好感知记忆更新机制(PAMU)，通过滑动窗口平均和指数移动平均的融合来动态优化LLM代理的长期记忆表示，显著提升了长期对话中的输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长期记忆方法在存储和检索方面有显著改进，但缺乏动态更新机制来适应用户行为和上下文的演变，无法有效优化偏好记忆表示。

Method: 提出PAMU机制，整合滑动窗口平均(SW)和指数移动平均(EMA)，构建融合的偏好感知表示，捕捉短期波动和长期用户倾向。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务场景上进行实验，结果显示该机制能显著提升五个基线模型在LLM输出质量方面的表现。

Conclusion: PAMU机制在长期对话中验证了其有效性，能够动态和个性化地优化记忆表示。

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based
agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term
memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in
historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the
storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for
similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most
existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack
mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in
response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we
propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic
and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW)
with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused
preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and
long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the
LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly
improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its
effectiveness in long-term conversations.

*Fanwei Zhu,Jinke Yu,Zulong Chen,Ying Zhou,Junhao Ji,Zhibo Yang,Yuxue Zhang,Haoyuan Hu,Zhenghao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个面向简历信息提取的布局感知和效率优化框架，解决了布局异构性、LLM高成本高延迟、缺乏标准化数据集三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化简历信息提取对规模化人才招聘至关重要，但面临三大挑战：简历布局和内容的极端异构性、大语言模型的高成本和延迟、缺乏标准化数据集和评估工具。

Method: 结合了微调的布局解析器来规范化不同文档格式、基于并行提示和指令调优的高效LLM提取器、以及由新基准数据集支持的两阶段自动评估框架。

Result: 广泛实验表明该框架在准确性和效率上都显著优于强基线。特别是，微调的0.6B紧凑LLM实现了顶级准确性，同时显著降低了推理延迟和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该系统已在阿里巴巴智能HR平台全面部署，支持其业务部门的实时应用。

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent
acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the
extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency
of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and
efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that
addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser
to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor
based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage
automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines
in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a
fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly
reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed
in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across
its business units.

*Yubo Sun,Chunyi Peng,Yukun Yan,Shi Yu,Zhenghao Liu,Chi Chen,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVisRAG是一个端到端的视觉检索增强生成框架，通过证据引导的多图像推理来解决当前VRAG系统在多图像感知和证据整合方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉检索增强生成系统在多图像感知和证据整合方面存在不足，导致推理基础薄弱和错误结论。

Method: 提出EVisRAG框架，首先观察检索到的图像并记录每张图像的证据，然后从聚合证据中得出最终答案。使用Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy Optimization (RS-GRPO)方法联合优化视觉感知和推理能力。

Result: 在多个视觉问答基准测试中，EVisRAG相比骨干VLM平均提升了27%的性能，能够精确感知和定位问题相关证据，并从证据中推导最终答案。

Conclusion: EVisRAG通过RS-GRPO优化，显著提升了多图像视觉推理能力，能够像真实侦探一样准确感知和整合证据。

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models
(VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce
hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and
integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and
erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end
framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address
this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image
evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train
EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy
Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific
tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs.
Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks
demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone
VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by
RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and
localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the
final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

### [10] [Judge's Verdict: A Comprehensive Analysis of LLM Judge Capability Through Human Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09738)
*Steve Han,Gilberto Titericz Junior,Tom Balough,Wenfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Judge's Verdict Benchmark，一种两步法评估LLM作为裁判的能力，测试54个模型在RAG和Agentic任务中复制人类判断的能力。发现27个模型达到Tier 1性能，其中23个展现类人判断模式，4个展现超一致行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM作为裁判在响应准确性评估任务中的表现，特别是能否复制人类判断，因为仅靠相关性分析不足以全面评估裁判能力。

Method: 两步法：先进行相关性测试筛选对齐度高的裁判，然后使用z分数进行人类相似性测试，识别类人判断（|z|<1）和超一致判断（z>1）两种模式。

Result: 54个模型中27个达到Tier 1性能：23个模型展现类人判断模式，4个展现超一致行为。模型性能不单纯依赖规模，而是特定训练策略。

Conclusion: 相关性分析不足以评估裁判能力，需要基于一致性模式的"图灵测试"，并提供了标准化基准来将LLM裁判分类到不同性能层级。

Abstract: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step
methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response
accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human
judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or
Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from
traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that
measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a
correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a
human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns:
human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and
super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement
levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1
performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of
human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern
that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of
complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11
closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge
excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training
strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation
alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for
judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark
for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different
evaluation needs.

### [11] [Gold Panning: Turning Positional Bias into Signal for Multi-Document LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09770)
*Adam Byerly,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Gold Panning Bandits框架，利用LLM的位置偏见作为诊断信号，通过重新排列文档来高效识别最相关内容，相比随机排列基线减少65%的查询次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多文档环境中存在强烈的位置偏见，传统方法将其视为需要减轻的噪声，但本文认为这种偏见可以作为诊断信号来利用。

Method: 将文档重新排序问题构建为二分图匹配问题，提出贪心O(N log N)策略，将最不确定的文档放在最具信息量的位置，相比匈牙利算法的O(N^3)时间更高效。

Result: 在知识密集型NLP任务中，该方法比随机排列基线减少多达65%的语言模型查询次数，显著降低计算成本且无需模型重新训练。

Conclusion: 这项工作表明，固有的LLM偏见可以从负担转变为资产，用于实现高效的推理时优化。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a strong position bias in multi-document
contexts, systematically prioritizing information based on location rather than
relevance. While existing approaches treat this bias as noise to be mitigated,
we introduce Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that leverages position bias as
a diagnostic signal: by reordering documents and observing shifts in the
model's responses, we can efficiently identify the most relevant content. We
frame the problem of choosing reorderings as a bipartite matching problem.
While an optimal assignment can be computed at each iteration with the
Hungarian algorithm in $O(N^3)$ time, we propose a greedy $O(N \log N)$
strategy that achieves comparable performance by prioritizing the placement of
the most uncertain documents in the most informative positions. Our approach
identifies relevant documents using up to 65\% fewer language model queries
than random permutation baselines on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks,
substantially reducing computational cost without model retraining. This work
demonstrates that inherent LLM biases can be transformed from liabilities into
assets for efficient, inference-time optimization.

*Rakib Hossan,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个针对孟加拉语仇恨言论分类的少样本框架，结合卡方统计分析和自适应多数投票机制，在BLP-2025任务1A中取得67.61的微F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督方法需要大量标注数据，这对低资源语言来说成本高昂，因此需要开发少样本学习框架。

Method: 使用卡方统计进行关键词提取，结合自适应多数投票机制进行决策，探索统计关键词选择与随机方法的对比。

Result: PromptGuard达到67.61的微F1分数，优于n-gram基线(60.75)和随机方法(14.65)，卡方关键词在所有类别中表现最一致。

Conclusion: 卡方关键词提取提供跨类别的持续改进，自适应投票机制对需要扩展分类轮次的模糊案例有益。

Abstract: The BLP-2025 Task 1A requires Bengali hate speech classification into six
categories. Traditional supervised approaches need extensive labeled datasets
that are expensive for low-resource languages. We developed PromptGuard, a
few-shot framework combining chi-square statistical analysis for keyword
extraction with adaptive majority voting for decision-making. We explore
statistical keyword selection versus random approaches and adaptive voting
mechanisms that extend classification based on consensus quality. Chi-square
keywords provide consistent improvements across categories, while adaptive
voting benefits ambiguous cases requiring extended classification rounds.
PromptGuard achieves a micro-F1 of 67.61, outperforming n-gram baselines
(60.75) and random approaches (14.65). Ablation studies confirm
chi-square-based keywords show the most consistent impact across all
categories.

*Michael Freenor,Lauren Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RISE方法通过旋转操作在嵌入空间中表示语义转换，揭示了多语言嵌入空间中话语级语义转换的几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言和嵌入模型如何编码语义关系对于模型可解释性和控制至关重要，但现代高维文本表示缺乏直观的几何解释性。

Method: 引入Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE)，利用现代语言表示的流形结构，将语义转换表示为嵌入空间中的一致旋转操作。

Result: 在3个嵌入模型、3个数据集和7种形态多样的语言上评估，RISE能一致地映射具有不同语法特征的话语级语义转换。

Conclusion: 首次系统证明话语级语义转换对应于多语言嵌入空间中的一致几何操作，在句子层面实证支持线性表示假设。

Abstract: Understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships
is fundamental to model interpretability and control. While early word
embeddings exhibited intuitive vector arithmetic (''king'' - ''man'' +
''woman'' = ''queen''), modern high-dimensional text representations lack
straightforward interpretable geometric properties. We introduce
Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE), a geometric approach that represents
semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding
space, leveraging the manifold structure of modern language representations.
RISE operations have the ability to operate across both languages and models
with high transfer of performance, suggesting the existence of analogous
cross-lingual geometric structure. We evaluate RISE across three embedding
models, three datasets, and seven morphologically diverse languages in five
major language groups. Our results demonstrate that RISE consistently maps
discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features
(e.g., negation and conditionality) across languages and models. This work
provides the first systematic demonstration that discourse-level semantic
transformations correspond to consistent geometric operations in multilingual
embedding spaces, empirically supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis
at the sentence level.

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干模型上的实验表明，NG-Router始终优于单智能体和集成基线方法。

Conclusion: NG-Router为复杂营养健康任务提供了一种原则性的领域感知多智能体推理方法。

Abstract: Diet plays a central role in human health, and Nutrition Question Answering
(QA) offers a promising path toward personalized dietary guidance and the
prevention of diet-related chronic diseases. However, existing methods face two
fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems
and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as
contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce
Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates
nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent
collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous
knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing
distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical
agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a
gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence
during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models
demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and
ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent
reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.

*Sil Hamilton,Matthew Wilkens,Andrew Piper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NarraBench提出了一个基于理论的故事理解任务分类法，并调查了该领域的78个现有基准，发现现有评估存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的故事理解评估覆盖不足，只有27%的任务被现有基准充分捕捉，许多重要方面如叙事事件、风格、视角和启示等几乎缺失。

Method: 开发了理论指导的故事理解任务分类法，并对78个现有基准进行了系统性调查和分析。

Result: 发现现有基准仅覆盖27%的叙事任务，许多关键方面评估缺失，特别是那些主观性和视角性方面。

Conclusion: 需要开发新的评估基准来覆盖被忽视的叙事理解方面，特别是那些主观性和视角性的方面，这对测试LLM的故事理解能力至关重要。

Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding
tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area.
We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative
understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned
with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative
tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas --
including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly
absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased
development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and
perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is
generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are
of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.

*Nafiseh Nikeghbal,Amir Hossein Kargaran,Jana Diesner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoBia是一个轻量级对抗攻击套件，通过构建包含偏见声明的对话来测试LLMs是否能从偏见中恢复并拒绝后续偏见问题，揭示了LLMs在对话中存在的偏见放大问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs加强了安全护栏，但在对话中仍会表现出有害行为，如种族主义观点。需要系统性地分析LLMs在何种条件下会偏离规范或伦理行为。

Method: CoBia创建包含偏见声明的构造对话，评估模型是否能从虚构的偏见声明中恢复并拒绝偏见的后续问题。评估了11个开源和专有LLMs在6个社会人口类别上的表现。

Result: 有目的构建的对话可靠地揭示了偏见放大，LLMs经常在对话中无法拒绝偏见的后续问题。这种压力测试突显了通过互动可以浮现的深层嵌入偏见。

Conclusion: CoBia方法有效揭示了LLMs中深层的偏见问题，表明当前的安全机制在对话情境下仍存在漏洞，需要更强大的偏见检测和缓解策略。

Abstract: Improvements in model construction, including fortified safety guardrails,
allow Large language models (LLMs) to increasingly pass standard safety checks.
However, LLMs sometimes slip into revealing harmful behavior, such as
expressing racist viewpoints, during conversations. To analyze this
systematically, we introduce CoBia, a suite of lightweight adversarial attacks
that allow us to refine the scope of conditions under which LLMs depart from
normative or ethical behavior in conversations. CoBia creates a constructed
conversation where the model utters a biased claim about a social group. We
then evaluate whether the model can recover from the fabricated bias claim and
reject biased follow-up questions. We evaluate 11 open-source as well as
proprietary LLMs for their outputs related to six socio-demographic categories
that are relevant to individual safety and fair treatment, i.e., gender, race,
religion, nationality, sex orientation, and others. Our evaluation is based on
established LLM-based bias metrics, and we compare the results against human
judgments to scope out the LLMs' reliability and alignment. The results suggest
that purposefully constructed conversations reliably reveal bias amplification
and that LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions during dialogue.
This form of stress-testing highlights deeply embedded biases that can be
surfaced through interaction. Code and artifacts are available at

### [18] [iBERT: Interpretable Style Embeddings via Sense Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09882)
*Vishal Anand,Milad Alshomary,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iBERT是一种可解释的BERT编码器，通过稀疏非负混合的上下文无关意义向量来表示输入标记，使嵌入具有内在可解释性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统语言模型嵌入缺乏可解释性和可控性的问题，设计能够模块化展示语言中判别性线索（如风格和语义结构）的嵌入表示。

Method: 使用稀疏非负混合的k个上下文无关意义向量表示每个输入标记，这些向量可以池化为句子嵌入或直接在标记级别使用，实现表示的模块化控制。

Result: 在STEL基准测试中，风格表示效果比SBERT基线提高约8个点，在作者验证任务中保持竞争力，并能将特定风格属性（如表情符号使用、正式性、拼写错误）分配给特定意义向量。

Conclusion: iBERT通过结构化模块化设计，能够可解释地分解数据中存在的任何判别性信号，即使监督混合了风格和语义因素也能实现泛化。

Abstract: We present iBERT (interpretable-BERT), an encoder to produce inherently
interpretable and controllable embeddings - designed to modularize and expose
the discriminative cues present in language, such as stylistic and semantic
structure. Each input token is represented as a sparse, non-negative mixture
over k context-independent sense vectors, which can be pooled into sentence
embeddings or used directly at the token level. This enables modular control
over representation, before any decoding or downstream use.
  To demonstrate our model's interpretability, we evaluate it on a suite of
style-focused tasks. On the STEL benchmark, it improves style representation
effectiveness by ~8 points over SBERT-style baselines, while maintaining
competitive performance on authorship verification. Because each embedding is a
structured composition of interpretable senses, we highlight how specific style
attributes - such as emoji use, formality, or misspelling can be assigned to
specific sense vectors. While our experiments center on style, iBERT is not
limited to stylistic modeling. Its structural modularity is designed to
interpretably decompose whichever discriminative signals are present in the
data - enabling generalization even when supervision blends stylistic and
semantic factors.

### [19] [DELTA: Dynamic Layer-Aware Token Attention for Efficient Long-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09883)
*Hossein Entezari Zarch,Lei Gao,Chaoyi Jiang,Murali Annavarm*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELTA是一种无需训练的稀疏注意力机制，通过将Transformer层分为三组（全注意力层、选择层、稀疏注意力层），在保持推理精度的同时显著减少计算量，在AIME和GPQA-Diamond等推理基准上达到5倍令牌减少和1.5倍端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在解码过程中需要关注整个不断增长的序列，导致高昂的计算成本。现有的稀疏注意力方法通过剪枝KV缓存来减少计算，但在推理任务中由于累积选择错误和令牌动态重要性变化而遭受严重的精度下降。

Method: 将Transformer层分为三组：初始层使用全注意力，少量选择层通过聚合头级注意力分数识别重要令牌，后续稀疏注意力层仅关注选定的令牌子集。这种设计在GPU内存中保留完整的KV缓存以保证精度，同时避免在许多层上进行昂贵的全注意力计算。

Result: 在AIME和GPQA-Diamond等推理基准上，DELTA在精度上匹配或超越全注意力方法，同时将关注的令牌数量减少高达5倍，并实现1.5倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: 选择性重用中间注意力图为实现高效长上下文推理提供了一条稳健的路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on
challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but
their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend
to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce
computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe
accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and
the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present
\textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves
computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions
transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a
small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via
aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention
layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full
KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention
computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and
GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while
reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering
$1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of
intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context
reasoning.

### [20] [Closing the Data-Efficiency Gap Between Autoregressive and Masked Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09885)
*Xu Pan,Ely Hahami,Jingxuan Fan,Ziqian Xie,Haim Sompolinsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current
dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via
fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the
challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in
the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly
emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of
better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training.
However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training
phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through
fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,
evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to
probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that
arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA
generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order
matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward
and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal
gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked
fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This
proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of
arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

### [21] [Abductive Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09887)
*Yijin Ni,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种反绎偏好学习方法，通过训练模型基于回答来区分提示，解决了现有偏好学习忽视反事实提示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型即使经过RLHF和DPO对齐后仍然存在过度自信问题，无法正确处理反事实提示，这源于传统偏好学习只关注给定提示选择正确回答，而忽视了应该改变回答的反事实提示。

Method: 提出了反绎偏好学习范式，通过构建反绎数据集，实现反绎DPO及其变体DPOP，将传统条件反转，学习基于回答的提示偏好。

Result: 在反绎数据集上，多任务DPOP将回答选择准确率从90.0%提升到99.5%，提示区分准确率从54.7%提升到85.0%。在AlpacaEval上，胜率从5.26%提升到6.17%。

Conclusion: 反绎偏好学习在保持传统偏好优化优势的同时，有效解决了反事实提示的挑战，提高了模型对提示差异的敏感性。

Abstract: Frontier large language models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet remain prone
to overconfidence even after alignment through Reinforcement Learning with
Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). For instance,
they tend to offer the same conservative answer "No" to both questions "Can I
eat the [food / potato chips] that has been left out overnight?" despite the
latter requiring no refridgeration for safe consumption. We find that this
failure is potentially attributed to a limitation of existing preference
learning: it emphasizes selecting the correct response for a given prompt,
while neglecting counterfactual prompts that should alter the response.
  To address this limitation, we propose abductive preference learning, a
fine-tuning paradigm that reverses the conventional conditioning by learning
preferences over prompts given a response. To validate this idea, we construct
an abductive dataset derived from the HaluEval QA benchmark with 1,001 entries,
implementing abductive DPO and its variant DPOP. Experiments reveal
complementary strengths: standard methods improve response selection, abductive
methods improve prompt discrimination, while a multitask objective unifies
both. On the abductive dataset, multitask DPOP boosts accuracy from $90.0\%$ to
$99.5\%$ in response selection and $54.7\%$ to $85.0\%$ in prompt
discrimination, with qualitative evidence highlighting improved sensitivity to
prompt differences. Finally, evaluation on AlpacaEval shows multitask DPOP
improves win rate (from $5.26\%$ to $6.17\%$), confirming that abductive
preference learning preserves the benefits of conventional preference
optimization while addressing the overlooked challenge of counterfactual
prompts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HIPPD是一个受大脑启发的性格检测框架，通过模拟人脑的分层信息处理机制，在大语言模型基础上结合动态记忆模块和专门化轻量模型，显著提升了从文本中检测性格特征的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法难以捕捉跨多个帖子的上下文信息，在语义稀疏环境中提取代表性特征的能力不足，需要更有效的框架来提升性格检测的准确性。

Method: 使用大语言模型模拟大脑皮层进行全局语义推理，动态记忆模块模拟前额叶皮层进行自适应门控和选择性保留，专门化轻量模型模拟基底神经节通过赢家通吃机制动态路由。

Result: 在Kaggle和Pandora数据集上的广泛实验表明，HIPPD持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 受大脑启发的分层信息处理框架能够有效提升性格检测性能，证明了神经科学原理在自然语言处理任务中的应用价值。

Abstract: Personality detection from text aims to infer an individual's personality
traits based on linguistic patterns. However, existing machine learning
approaches often struggle to capture contextual information spanning multiple
posts and tend to fall short in extracting representative and robust features
in semantically sparse environments. This paper presents HIPPD, a
brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the
hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large
language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic
reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after
the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of
critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error
feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the
basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism
to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at
recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets
demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

### [23] [When or What? Understanding Consumer Engagement on Digital Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10474)
*Jingyi Wu,Junying Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析TED演讲数据发现，内容创作者与观众偏好之间存在持续错配，且时间动态对观众参与度的影响比主题内容更强，挑战了内容特征是受欢迎度主要驱动因素的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字服务经济中，理解什么驱动受欢迎度至关重要。以往研究主要强调内容特征的作用，但创作者经常误判观众真正重视的内容。

Method: 应用潜在狄利克雷分配(LDA)模型分析大量TED演讲数据，将平台视为创作者(演讲者)与消费者(观众)互动的数字服务提供案例，比较创作者的主题供给与观众参与度表达的需求。

Result: 识别出创作者供给与消费者偏好之间的持续错配，纵向分析显示时间动态对消费者参与度的影响比主题内容更强，表明内容交付时机可能比内容本身更重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了内容特征是受欢迎度主要驱动因素的假设，强调了时机和情境因素在塑造消费者反应中的重要性，为数字平台上的消费者注意力动态提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding what drives popularity is critical in today's digital service
economy, where content creators compete for consumer attention. Prior studies
have primarily emphasized the role of content features, yet creators often
misjudge what audiences actually value. This study applies Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) modeling to a large corpus of TED Talks, treating the platform
as a case of digital service provision in which creators (speakers) and
consumers (audiences) interact. By comparing the thematic supply of creators
with the demand expressed in audience engagement, we identify persistent
mismatches between producer offerings and consumer preferences. Our
longitudinal analysis further reveals that temporal dynamics exert a stronger
influence on consumer engagement than thematic content, suggesting that when
content is delivered may matter more than what is delivered. These findings
challenge the dominant assumption that content features are the primary drivers
of popularity and highlight the importance of timing and contextual factors in
shaping consumer responses. The results provide new insights into consumer
attention dynamics on digital platforms and carry practical implications for
marketers, platform managers, and content creators seeking to optimize audience
engagement strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Switch Generation方法，通过让预训练模型和对齐模型在生成过程中交替"发言"，实现模型协作，在保持推理和指令跟随能力的同时，保留创造性和校准等技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对齐训练存在权衡：虽然能提升语言模型的推理和指令跟随能力，但可能损失创造性和校准等技能。目标是让训练流水线中的不同模型协作互补，实现两全其美。

Method: 提出Switch Generation方法，训练一个切换器语言模型，学习在不同查询和上下文中选择不同模型生成下一个片段。推理时，切换器指导不同模型检查点动态生成最需要的片段。

Result: 在8个模型协作基线和18个数据集上的实验表明：1）模型协作在16/18任务上持续优于单个模型；2）Switch Generation比基线平均提升12.9%。

Conclusion: Switch Generation能够发现组合技能来解决单个模型难以处理的问题，并能泛化到未见过的模型和任务，有效重用和重新利用昂贵模型训练流水线中的副产品。

Abstract: Alignment training has tradeoffs: it helps language models (LMs) gain in
reasoning and instruction following but might lose out on skills such as
creativity and calibration, where unaligned base models are better at. We aim
to make the best of both worlds through model collaboration, where different
models in the training pipeline collaborate and complement each other. Since LM
responses feature interleaving skills that favor different models, we propose
Switch Generation, where pretrained and aligned model versions take turns to
``speak'' in a response sequence. Specifically, we train a switcher LM by
learning from outcomes of choosing different models to generate the next
segment across diverse queries and contexts. At inference time, the switcher LM
guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate the next segment
where their strengths are most needed. Extensive experiments with 8 model
collaboration baselines and 18 datasets show that 1) model collaboration
consistently outperforms individual models on 16 out of 18 tasks, and 2) Switch
Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average. Further analysis
reveals that Switch Generation discovers compositional skills to solve problems
where individual models struggle and generalizes to unseen models and tasks,
reusing and repurposing by-products in expensive model training pipelines that
are otherwise discarded.

TL;DR: 该研究审计了6个大型语言模型在2820个招聘场景中的表现，发现这些模型对残障人士存在显著的歧视性偏见，特别是当残障与性别、种姓等身份交叉时，偏见更加严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注西方背景，忽视了全球南方地区残障人士面临的交叉性边缘化问题（如性别和种姓），需要评估LLMs在招聘等高风险领域对残障人士的歧视问题。

Method: 引入ABLEIST框架（包含5个残障歧视特定指标和3个交叉性伤害指标），对6个LLMs在2820个招聘场景中进行全面审计，涵盖不同残障、性别、国籍和种姓背景。

Result: 发现对残障候选人的ABLEIST伤害显著增加，许多最先进模型未能检测到这些伤害。性别和种姓边缘化的残障候选人的交叉性伤害（如象征主义）急剧增加。

Conclusion: 当前安全工具存在关键盲点，需要在招聘等高风险领域对前沿模型进行交叉性安全评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly under scrutiny for perpetuating
identity-based discrimination in high-stakes domains such as hiring,
particularly against people with disabilities (PwD). However, existing research
remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of
marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the
Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring
scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles.
To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST
(Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five
ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability
studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms
towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to
detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional
harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates,
highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for
intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains
like hiring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型能生成流畅摘要，但经常产生包含幻觉的不忠实内容，现有缓解策略无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 使用多种LLM自动生成训练集摘要，用GPT-4o进行span级幻觉标注，然后通过梯度上升、unlikelihood训练和任务向量否定三种方法微调LLM。

Result: 实验结果显示所有三种方法都能有效利用span级标注提高忠实性，其中unlikelihood训练效果最好。

Conclusion: span级标注能有效提升LLM摘要生成的忠实性，unlikelihood训练是最有前景的方法。

Abstract: Abstractive summarization using large language models (LLMs) has become an
essential tool for condensing information. However, despite their ability to
generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries,
introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing
mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive
learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address
the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we
investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans
in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set
of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use
GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging
these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and
annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we
introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries
with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to
improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent,
unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that
all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve
faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.

Motivation: 现有研究使用多种方法生成封闭式调查响应，但缺乏标准实践。需要系统评估不同生成方法对预测调查响应的影响。

Method: 使用8种调查响应生成方法、4个政治态度调查和10个开源语言模型，生成了3200万个模拟调查响应进行对比分析。

Result: 不同生成方法在个体层面和子群体层面的对齐效果存在显著差异，限制性生成方法整体表现最佳。

Conclusion: 调查响应生成方法对模拟调查响应有显著影响，研究为应用这些方法提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Many in-silico simulations of human survey responses with large language
models (LLMs) focus on generating closed-ended survey responses, whereas LLMs
are typically trained to generate open-ended text instead. Previous research
has used a diverse range of methods for generating closed-ended survey
responses with LLMs, and a standard practice remains to be identified. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the impact that various Survey Response
Generation Methods have on predicted survey responses. We present the results
of 32 mio. simulated survey responses across 8 Survey Response Generation
Methods, 4 political attitude surveys, and 10 open-weight language models. We
find significant differences between the Survey Response Generation Methods in
both individual-level and subpopulation-level alignment. Our results show that
Restricted Generation Methods perform best overall, and that reasoning output
does not consistently improve alignment. Our work underlines the significant
impact that Survey Response Generation Methods have on simulated survey
responses, and we develop practical recommendations on the application of
Survey Response Generation Methods.

TL;DR: SHIELD框架通过建模预设上下文和检测虚假声明来检测仇恨表情包，在多数据集和指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仇恨表情包检测主要依赖预训练语言模型，但较少关注仇恨表情包的本质特征。基于哲学和心理学洞察，仇恨表情包具有预设上下文和表达虚假声明两个关键特征。

Method: 开发PCM模块建模多模态上下文信息，引入FACT模块整合外部知识并利用跨模态参考图检测虚假声明，结合两者构建SHIELD框架。

Result: SHIELD在多个数据集和评估指标上优于最先进方法，并在假新闻检测等其他任务上表现出良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过建模预设上下文和检测虚假声明，SHIELD能够有效捕捉仇恨表情包的本质特征，实现更准确的检测效果。

Abstract: While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate,
causing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful
meme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus
has been dedicated to \textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights
from philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized
by two essential features: a \textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of
\textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \textbf{PCM}
for modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims,
we introduce the \textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and
harnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce
\textbf{\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to
capture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while
demonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.

Result: 发现英语分词稳定性高，中文分词率较高，印地语存在严重分割问题；STRR指标有效揭示了跨语言公平性问题。

Conclusion: STRR补充了传统fertility指标的不足，为设计更公平的多语言分词器提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models
(LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word),
captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated
across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across
seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high
fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's
blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures
the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic
prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in
Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results
show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for
designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架，将LLM的审议树搜索分解为三个核心组件：搜索机制、奖励公式和转移函数，明确了搜索指导与参数化奖励建模的区别，为自主自改进代理的研究提供了系统化路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前审议树搜索领域缺乏统一的形式化框架，特别是在奖励信号的角色上存在模糊性——它究竟是临时启发式还是持久学习目标？这种模糊性阻碍了该领域的系统性发展。

Method: 引入统一框架将搜索算法分解为三个核心组件：搜索机制、奖励公式和转移函数，并正式区分了用于测试时扩展的瞬时搜索指导和用于自改进的持久参数化奖励建模。

Result: 建立了组件中心分类法，综合了最先进技术，并为创建自主自改进代理的系统性进展绘制了研究路线图。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了奖励信号角色的模糊性，为审议树搜索领域的统一形式化提供了基础，推动了从暴力扩展向算法效率的转变，并为自主自改进代理的发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Deliberative tree search is a cornerstone of modern Large Language Model
(LLM) research, driving the pivot from brute-force scaling toward algorithmic
efficiency. This single paradigm unifies two critical frontiers:
\textbf{Test-Time Scaling (TTS)}, which deploys on-demand computation to solve
hard problems, and \textbf{Self-Improvement}, which uses search-generated data
to durably enhance model parameters. However, this burgeoning field is
fragmented and lacks a common formalism, particularly concerning the ambiguous
role of the reward signal -- is it a transient heuristic or a durable learning
target? This paper resolves this ambiguity by introducing a unified framework
that deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: the
\emph{Search Mechanism}, \emph{Reward Formulation}, and \emph{Transition
Function}. We establish a formal distinction between transient \textbf{Search
Guidance} for TTS and durable \textbf{Parametric Reward Modeling} for
Self-Improvement. Building on this formalism, we introduce a component-centric
taxonomy, synthesize the state-of-the-art, and chart a research roadmap toward
more systematic progress in creating autonomous, self-improving agents.

TL;DR: 研究调查了在博物馆环境中，机器翻译的流畅性和充分性错误如何影响双语和非双语用户对MT的依赖程度。发现非双语用户由于缺乏评估策略而过度依赖MT，但错误体验会促使用户重新评估依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器翻译日益普及，了解公众如何感知和依赖不完美的MT对于将MT研究置于实际应用背景中至关重要。

Method: 在公共博物馆进行人类研究（n=452），调查流畅性和充分性错误如何影响双语和非双语用户在休闲使用中对MT的依赖。

Result: 非双语用户由于缺乏评估策略和替代方案而经常过度依赖MT，但经历错误影响会促使用户重新评估未来的依赖程度。

Conclusion: MT评估和NLP解释技术不仅需要提升MT质量，还需要促进用户对MT的认知素养。

Abstract: As Machine Translation (MT) becomes increasingly commonplace, understanding
how the general public perceives and relies on imperfect MT is crucial for
contextualizing MT research in real-world applications. We present a human
study conducted in a public museum (n=452), investigating how fluency and
adequacy errors impact bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance on MT during
casual use. Our findings reveal that non-bilingual users often over-rely on MT
due to a lack of evaluation strategies and alternatives, while experiencing the
impact of errors can prompt users to reassess future reliance. This highlights
the need for MT evaluation and NLP explanation techniques to promote not only
MT quality, but also MT literacy among its users.

TL;DR: 本文提出在语音到单元翻译(S2UT)模型中引入多令牌预测(MTP)损失，通过在中间层应用MTP损失来增强隐藏表示的信息密度，从而提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音到语音翻译方法使用语音令牌作为中间表示，但单个令牌语义密度不足，需要多个令牌才能表达完整语义单元。

Method: 提出MTP-S2UT损失，在计算CTC损失的隐藏表示层应用多令牌预测损失，使模型能在每个位置预测多个后续令牌，提前增强信息密度。

Result: 实验表明所有MTP损失变体都能提升S2UT翻译质量，其中MTP-S2UT表现最佳。

Conclusion: 在中间层应用MTP损失能更早、更有效地增强隐藏表示，显著提升语音到语音翻译性能。

Abstract: Current direct speech-to-speech translation methods predominantly employ
speech tokens as intermediate representations. However, a single speech token
is not dense in semantics, so we generally need multiple tokens to express a
complete semantic unit. To address this limitation, we introduce multi-token
prediction (MTP) loss into speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models, enabling
models to predict multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thereby
capturing more complete semantics and enhancing information density per
position. Initial MTP implementations apply the loss at the final layer, which
improves output representation but initiates information enrichment too late.
We hypothesize that advancing the information enrichment process to
intermediate layers can achieve earlier and more effective enhancement of
hidden representation. Consequently, we propose MTP-S2UT loss, applying MTP
loss to hidden representation where CTC loss is computed. Experiments
demonstrate that all MTP loss variants consistently improve the quality of S2UT
translation, with MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance.

TL;DR: 提出了ExpandSearch方法，通过强化学习训练LLM搜索代理，具备查询扩展能力，使用挤压器模型辅助理解检索文档，在7个QA基准测试中平均提升4.4%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理增强搜索代理在复杂多跳QA任务中表现不佳，主要受限于推理和搜索能力不足，难以处理复杂复合查询。

Method: 使用强化学习训练LLM搜索代理，每轮生成多个查询变体并行搜索；引入预训练挤压器模型帮助理解检索文档，让搜索代理专注于查询生成以提高检索召回率。

Result: 在7个QA基准测试中平均提升4.4%准确率，在多跳推理任务上表现优异，即使3B小模型也能展现强大的查询扩展能力。

Conclusion: 通过查询扩展和挤压器模型的结合，小规模LLM也能在多跳QA任务中实现最先进性能，证明了该方法在复杂推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents, such as Search-R1, are trained to reason,
search, and generate the final answer iteratively. Nevertheless, due to their
limited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA
benchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound
queries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query
expansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent
proposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover
more relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and
computing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master
multiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information
understanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a
pre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved
documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high
retrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that
even a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query
expansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks.
To be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average
improvement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains
on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文识别了大型语言模型在长链思维推理中的路径漂移漏洞，即推理轨迹会偏离安全对齐路径，导致违反安全约束的内容。提出了诱导框架和防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM通过RLHF等技术进行了安全对齐，但在复杂的长链推理任务中，推理轨迹仍可能偏离安全路径，产生违反安全约束的内容，这是一个未被充分探索的漏洞。

Method: 通过实证分析识别了三种路径漂移行为触发因素，提出了包含认知负荷放大、自我角色启动和条件链劫持的三阶段路径漂移诱导框架，并设计了包含角色归因修正和元认知反思的路径级防御策略。

Result: 研究发现每个诱导阶段都能独立降低拒绝率，组合使用时效果进一步增强。路径漂移现象确实存在且可通过系统方法诱导。

Conclusion: 长链推理需要超越词元级对齐的轨迹级对齐监督，路径漂移揭示了当前安全对齐在复杂推理场景下的局限性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning tasks, Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) prompting has emerged as a
key paradigm for structured inference. Despite early-stage safeguards enabled
by alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored
vulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned
paths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this
phenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral
triggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven
reasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where
surface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain
escalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe
completions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift
Induction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming,
and condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates,
while their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks,
we propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution
correction and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues). Our findings
highlight the need for trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form
reasoning beyond token-level alignment.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在医疗场景下使用轻量级BERT模型进行医学摘要分类，发现DistilBERT在交叉熵损失下表现最佳，为医疗NLP部署提供了实用方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗环境中部署面临成本、延迟和隐私限制，需要探索轻量级解决方案。

Method: 使用医学摘要语料库，在固定分词器、序列长度、优化器和调度的情况下，对BERT base和DistilBERT进行微调，比较三种损失函数：标准交叉熵、类别加权交叉熵和焦点损失。

Result: DistilBERT在标准交叉熵损失下在测试集上表现最佳，同时使用的参数远少于BERT base。报告了准确率、宏F1和加权F1指标。

Conclusion: 建议从紧凑编码器和交叉熵开始，然后添加校准和任务特定检查，最后再考虑更重的模型，为医疗NLP部署提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Large language models work well for many NLP tasks, but they are hard to
deploy in health settings with strict cost, latency, and privacy limits. We
revisit a lightweight recipe for medical abstract classification and ask how
far compact encoders can go under a controlled budget. Using the public medical
abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and DistilBERT with three objectives
standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross entropy, and focal loss keeping
tokenizer, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule fixed. DistilBERT with
plain cross-entropy gives the best balance on the test set while using far
fewer parameters than BERT base. We report accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1,
release the evaluation code, and include confusion analyses to make error
patterns clear. Our results suggest a practical default: start with a compact
encoder and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before
moving to heavier models.

Motivation: 现有嵌入模型评估框架如MTEB缺乏可靠的人类表现估计，限制了模型分数的可解释性，难以理解模型在捕捉语义和细微差别方面的真实能力。

Method: 开发HUME人类评估框架，在16个MTEB数据集上测量人类表现，涵盖重排序、分类、聚类和语义文本相似性任务，覆盖高资源和低资源语言。

Result: 人类平均表现达到77.6%，最佳嵌入模型为80.1%；模型在某些数据集上接近天花板性能，但在其他数据集上表现不佳，特别是在低资源语言中。

Conclusion: 提供了人类性能基准、任务难度模式洞察和可扩展评估框架，使模型评估更有意义，并为模型和基准开发提供信息。

Abstract: Comparing human and model performance offers a valuable perspective for
understanding the strengths and limitations of embedding models, highlighting
where they succeed and where they fail to capture meaning and nuance. However,
such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is
difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation
Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model
evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the
interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB
datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual
similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages.
Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best
embedding model, although variation is substantial: models reach near-ceiling
performance on some datasets while struggling on others, suggesting dataset
issues and revealing shortcomings in low-resource languages. We provide human
performance baselines, insight into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible
evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of the model
and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset,
and leaderboard are publicly available at

### [37] [CLMN: Concept based Language Models via Neural Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10063)
*Yibo Yang*

TL;DR: CLMN是一个神经符号框架，通过连续可读的概念嵌入和模糊逻辑推理，在保持性能的同时提升NLP模型的可解释性，特别是在处理动态概念交互方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在NLP中取得了进展，但可解释性仍然有限，尤其是在医疗和金融领域。现有的概念瓶颈模型要么使用损害文本表示的二元激活，要么使用削弱语义的潜在概念，且很少建模动态概念交互。

Method: CLMN将概念表示为连续、人类可读的嵌入，应用模糊逻辑推理学习自适应交互规则，说明概念如何相互影响及影响最终决策。模型通过概念感知表示增强原始文本特征，并自动推导可解释的逻辑规则。

Result: 在多个数据集和预训练语言模型上，CLMN比现有基于概念的方法实现了更高的准确性，同时提高了解释质量。

Conclusion: 在统一概念空间中整合神经表示与符号推理可以产生实用、透明的NLP系统。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited,
especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions
to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations
that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and
they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We
introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic
framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents
concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic
reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect
each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features
with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable
logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN
achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving
explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations
with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical,
transparent NLP systems.

Motivation: 当前专注于推理的大语言模型在法律领域处理复杂问题的能力尚未充分探索，需要解决法律知识不足、推理逻辑不可靠和业务泛化能力弱三大挑战。

Method: 构建包含17K高质量思维链样本的数据集，采用监督微调和强化学习的两阶段训练策略，开发专门的法律推理评估基准。

Result: 在权威基准测试中表现强劲，超越了所有同规模模型，与更大的DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B性能相当(54.9%)，在LawBench和LexEval上平均超过Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct 6.6%。

Conclusion: Unilaw-R1证明了轻量级模型通过专门的数据集和训练策略可以在法律推理任务中取得优异表现，为法律AI应用提供了可解释的决策支持。

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving across
various domains, yet their capabilities in handling complex legal problems
remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language
model tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter
scale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively
tackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal
knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To
address these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset
containing 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on
this, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the
performance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable
decision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we
also introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate
models across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates
strong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar
scale and achieving performance on par with the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%). Following domain-specific training, it
also showed significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (46.6%) by an average margin of 6.6%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A-IPO是一种自适应意图驱动的偏好优化方法，通过推断用户提示背后的潜在意图并融入奖励函数，解决了现有对齐方法忽视少数意见和用户潜在意图的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法如DPO往往默认多数观点，忽视了少数意见，且无法捕捉用户提示中的潜在意图。人类偏好具有多样性和动态性，受地区、文化和社会因素影响。

Method: A-IPO引入意图模块推断用户提示的潜在意图，并将推断的意图明确纳入奖励函数，通过意图-响应相似性项增加偏好边际，实现更清晰的首选和非首选响应分离。

Result: A-IPO在多个基准测试中显著优于现有基线：Real-pref上胜率提升24.8%，响应意图一致性提升45.6%；Attack-pref上响应相似性提升38.6%，防御成功率提升52.2%；GlobalOpinionQA-Ext上意图一致性得分提升54.6%。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模多样用户意图，A-IPO促进了多元偏好优化，同时增强了偏好对齐的对抗鲁棒性，在真实世界和对抗性偏好对齐评估中表现优异。

Abstract: Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and
social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority
opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive
\textbf{\underline{I}}ntent-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}reference
\textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization (\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO
introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user
prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward
function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's
responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response
similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of
$\lambda\,\Delta\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation
between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.
  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along
with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess
real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates
pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial
robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation
demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding
substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6
Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity
and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention
Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

TL;DR: 提出了PerAugy数据增强技术，通过跨轨迹混洗和摘要内容扰动来提升个性化摘要模型的性能，显著提高了用户编码器的准确性和个性化摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化摘要面临训练数据稀缺的挑战，现有数据集如MS/CAS PENS缺乏目标摘要且主题转换多样性有限，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 开发了PerAugy数据增强技术，包含跨轨迹混洗和摘要内容扰动，并引入三个数据集多样性指标(TP、RTC、DegreeD)来量化增强效果。

Result: PerAugy显著提升了四种SOTA用户编码器的准确性(AUC最佳提升0.132)，并使两个SOTA摘要框架的个性化程度平均提升61.2%(基于PSE-SU4指标)。

Conclusion: 数据集多样性是驱动性能提升的关键因素，TP和DegreeD指标与用户编码器性能在所有准确度指标上均呈现强相关性。

Abstract: Document summarization enables efficient extraction of user-relevant content
but is inherently shaped by individual subjectivity, making it challenging to
identify subjective salient information in multifaceted documents. This
complexity underscores the necessity for personalized summarization. However,
training models for personalized summarization has so far been challenging,
particularly because diverse training data containing both user preference
history (i.e., click-skip trajectory) and expected (gold-reference) summaries
are scarce. The MS/CAS PENS dataset is a valuable resource but includes only
preference history without target summaries, preventing end-to-end supervised
learning, and its limited topic-transition diversity further restricts
generalization. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{PerAugy}$, a novel
cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation based data
augmentation technique that significantly boosts the accuracy of four
state-of-the-art baseline (SOTA) user-encoders commonly used in personalized
summarization frameworks (best result: $\text{0.132}$$\uparrow$ w.r.t AUC). We
select two such SOTA summarizer frameworks as baselines and observe that when
augmented with their corresponding improved user-encoders, they consistently
show an increase in personalization (avg. boost: $\text{61.2\%}\uparrow$ w.r.t.
PSE-SU4 metric). As a post-hoc analysis of the role of induced diversity in the
augmented dataset by \peraugy, we introduce three dataset diversity metrics --
$\mathrm{TP}$, $\mathrm{RTC}$, and \degreed\ to quantify the induced diversity.
We find that $\mathrm{TP}$ and $\mathrm{DegreeD}$ strongly correlate with
user-encoder performance on the PerAugy-generated dataset across all accuracy
metrics, indicating that increased dataset diversity is a key factor driving
performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought推理方法存在过度思考问题，导致推理成本增加和错误结论，需要自适应停止机制来优化推理过程。

Method: 结合两阶段停止判别器和滑动窗口UCB多臂老虎机控制器，动态识别冗余推理并调整停止阈值，无需监督或微调。

Result: 在四个基准测试和两个模型家族上，REFRAIN减少20-55%的token使用量，同时保持或提升准确性。

Conclusion: 何时停止推理是测试时扩展的新实用维度，使模型能够进行适量而非过度的推理。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has driven recent gains of large language
models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks by externalizing intermediate steps.
However, excessive or redundant reasoning -- so-called overthinking -- can
increase inference costs and lead LLMs toward incorrect conclusions. In this
paper, we present REFRAIN ($\underline{REF}$lective-$\underline{R}$edundancy
for $\underline{A}$daptive $\underline{IN}$ference), a training-free framework
that adaptively determines when to stop reasoning to mitigate overthinking.
REFRAIN integrates a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective yet
redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB)
multi-armed bandit controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds
according to problem difficulty without supervision or fine-tuning. Across four
representative benchmarks and two model families, REFRAIN reduces token usage
by 20-55% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to standard CoT
prompting. Extensive ablation and robustness analyses demonstrate its stability
across models, scorers, and prompt variations. In summary, our findings
highlight when-to-stop as a new and practical axis of test-time scaling --
enabling models to reason not just more, but just enough.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统在处理大规模非结构化语料时效果有限，而现有的基于知识图谱的RAG方法依赖不稳定且成本高昂的关系提取，导致图谱噪声大、检索质量下降。

Method: LinearRAG构建无关系层次图（Tri-Graph），仅使用轻量级实体提取和语义链接，避免不稳定关系建模。采用两阶段检索策略：通过局部语义桥接激活相关实体，然后通过全局重要性聚合进行段落检索。

Result: 在四个数据集上的广泛实验表明，LinearRAG显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: LinearRAG提供了一种经济可靠的图构建方法，能够线性扩展语料规模且不消耗额外token，实现了高效可靠的检索增强生成。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate
hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external
knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle
with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent
advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures,
enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.
However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and
costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs
with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In
this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose
LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient
framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage
retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical
graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic
linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph
construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token
consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original
passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant
entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage
retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four
datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

*Zilong Wang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合OCR引擎和LLM的系统框架，用于优化重复性文档信息提取任务的准确率-效率权衡，通过智能策略选择利用文档特定特征，在身份文档提取中实现了高精度和亚秒级处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业文档处理中大量结构相似内容的信息提取这一关键但研究不足的挑战，优化重复性文档提取任务中的准确率-效率权衡。

Method: 结合OCR引擎和LLM的系统框架，通过智能策略选择利用文档特定特征，实现了三种提取范式（直接、替换和基于表格）的25种配置，在四种格式（PNG、DOCX、XLSX、PDF）的身份文档上进行评估。

Result: 基于表格的提取方法取得了优异结果：结构化文档F1=1.0准确率，延迟0.97秒；具有挑战性的图像输入F1=0.997准确率，延迟0.6秒（与PaddleOCR集成），同时保持亚秒级处理速度。相比朴素方法，性能提升54倍。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了一个通用原则：通过结构感知的方法选择，可以将复制繁重任务的重复性从计算负担转变为优化机会，为处理异构文档流提供了生产规模的解决方案。

Abstract: Information extraction from copy-heavy documents, characterized by massive
volumes of structurally similar content, represents a critical yet understudied
challenge in enterprise document processing. We present a systematic framework
that strategically combines OCR engines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off inherent in repetitive document
extraction tasks. Unlike existing approaches that pursue universal solutions,
our method exploits document-specific characteristics through intelligent
strategy selection. We implement and evaluate 25 configurations across three
extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, and table-based) on identity
documents spanning four formats (PNG, DOCX, XLSX, PDF). Through table-based
extraction methods, our adaptive framework delivers outstanding results: F1=1.0
accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy
with 0.6 s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR, all
while maintaining sub-second processing speeds. The 54 times performance
improvement compared with multimodal methods over naive approaches, coupled
with format-aware routing, enables processing of heterogeneous document streams
at production scale. Beyond the specific application to identity extraction,
this work establishes a general principle: the repetitive nature of copy-heavy
tasks can be transformed from a computational burden into an optimization
opportunity through structure-aware method selection.

TL;DR: DiffHeads是一个轻量级的LLM去偏框架，通过识别注意力头在直接回答和思维链提示下的差异激活来选择性屏蔽偏见头，有效减少不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注偏见输出的出现时机，但缺乏对生成机制的深入理解，导致去偏方法脆弱。需要系统研究LLM不公平性并开发更有效的去偏机制。

Method: 1. 比较直接回答和思维链提示在8个代表性LLM中的表现；2. 定义token-to-head贡献分数追踪注意力头影响；3. 提出DiffHeads框架，通过差异激活分析识别偏见头并选择性屏蔽。

Result: 直接回答提示会触发LLM的固有偏见，不公平性增加534.5%-391.9%；发现一小簇偏见头在直接回答下激活但在思维链下休眠；DiffHeads在直接回答和思维链下分别减少不公平性49.4%和40.3%，且不影响模型效用。

Conclusion: DiffHeads通过因果机制分析提供了首个提示策略与偏见出现之间的因果联系，实现了有效的轻量级去偏，为理解LLM偏见机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where
unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes
when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that
generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a
lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA)
prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open-
and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve
measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues.
Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's
influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of
bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing
the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally,
building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads
through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively
masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under
DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

<details>

Motivation: 多LLM系统虽然能增强语言模型的创造力，但存在计算成本高、推理延迟大的显著缺点。

Method: 在模型激活空间中提取和混合多个不同的人格向量，在推理时用融合后的向量引导生成过程，实现多视角输出而无需显式的多LLM通信。

Result: 在面向创造力的基准测试中，BILLY超越了单模型提示和传统多LLM方法，同时大幅减少了推理时间和计算成本。

Conclusion: 不同人格向量的混合既能有效控制生成的互补方面，又能提高可解释性，为单模型实现多LLM协作提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by
simulating human collective intelligence but suffer from significant drawbacks,
such as high computational costs and inference latency. To address these
limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng persona vectors for Large Language
model creativitY), a training-free framework that captures the benefits of
multi-LLM collaboration, i.e. inducing diverse perspectives and specialized
expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending
multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We
steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference,
enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our
experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY
surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while
substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses
further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both
effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM从客观任务转向主观决策应用，其黑盒特性和类人生成内容带来了幻觉、偏见、不公平和版权侵权等多方面风险，需要多角度信息溯源来增强透明度、问责制和可信度。

Method: 从模型视角（模型溯源和模型结构溯源）和数据视角（训练数据溯源和外部数据溯源）四个维度分析，并提出了先验基于（主动嵌入可追溯性）和后验基于（回顾性推断）的双范式分类法。

Result: 建立了系统的LLM生成内容溯源框架，通过多维度分析增强了LLM部署的透明度、问责制和可信度。

Conclusion: 跨维度的可追溯性对于提升LLM在现实应用中的透明度、问责制和可信度至关重要，为构建可信AI系统提供了理论基础和方法指导。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
artificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g.,
recognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning,
decision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications
spanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare,
finance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due
to the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated
content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright
infringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing
information from multiple perspectives is essential.
  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for
content generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that
together capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model
perspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish
content generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model
Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing
architectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data
perspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing
the origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In
contrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying
external information used to support or influence the responses of model.
Moreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing
sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and
posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these
dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of
LLMs deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Reasoning is an important task for large language models (LLMs). Among all
the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types,
which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the
non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge
generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental
mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance
of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this
paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs.
First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three
main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then,
current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified
sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is
derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive
ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks,
providing a solid foundation for future research.

TL;DR: 本研究对基于大语言模型的多智能体医疗咨询系统进行了大规模实证分析，揭示了仅关注最终答案准确性的局限性，并识别出四种主要的协作失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多智能体系统在医疗咨询模拟中仅评估最终答案准确性，将其内部协作过程视为黑箱，忽略了诊断结论是否通过合理可验证的推理路径得出，这在高风险医疗应用中存在重大风险。

Method: 对来自六个医疗数据集和六个代表性多智能体框架的3,600个案例进行大规模实证研究，采用结合定性分析和定量审计的混合方法，开发了协作失败模式的全面分类法。

Result: 定量审计揭示了四种主要失败模式：由共享模型缺陷驱动的有缺陷共识、正确少数意见的压制、无效的讨论动态以及合成过程中的关键信息丢失。

Conclusion: 仅靠高准确性不足以建立临床或公众信任，迫切需要透明和可审计的推理过程，这是负责任开发和部署医疗AI的基石。

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise in
simulating medical consultations, their evaluation is often confined to
final-answer accuracy. This practice treats their internal collaborative
processes as opaque "black boxes" and overlooks a critical question: is a
diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway?
The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes
medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy
conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600
cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks.
Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with
quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative
failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns:
flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct
minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information
loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an
insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need
for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the
responsible development and deployment of medical AI.

TL;DR: Delora是一个新颖的框架，通过解耦样本选择和模型训练来解决带噪标签的PEFT微调问题。它引入干净和噪声LoRA来建立噪声标签检测器，利用记忆效应区分干净和噪声样本，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中收集的训练数据往往包含噪声标签，传统方法基于小损失选择样本但容易形成恶性循环，导致性能不佳。需要打破这种循环来提升学习效果。

Method: 提出Delora框架，将样本选择与模型训练解耦：1）引入干净LoRA和噪声LoRA建立噪声标签检测器；2）利用记忆效应，干净LoRA记忆干净数据，噪声LoRA记忆误标数据作为可学习阈值；3）使用精心选择的样本无缝微调语言模型。

Result: 在合成和真实世界噪声数据集上的实验结果表明，Delora在噪声标签检测和文本分类任务中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: Delora通过解耦样本选择和模型训练，有效解决了带噪标签的PEFT微调问题，在噪声标签检测和文本分类任务中取得了良好效果。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) large language models (LLMs) have
shown impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, in many
real-world scenarios, the collected training data inevitably contains noisy
labels. To learn from noisy labels, most solutions select samples with small
losses for model training. However, the selected samples, in turn, impact the
loss computation in the next iteration. An inaccurate initial selection can
create a vicious cycle, leading to suboptimal performance. To break this cycle,
we propose Delora, a novel framework that decouples the sample selection from
model training. For sample selection, Delora establishes a noisy label detector
by introducing clean and noisy LoRA. Benefiting from the memory effect, the
clean LoRA is encouraged to memorize clean data, while the noisy LoRA is
constrained to memorize mislabeled data, which serves as a learnable threshold
for selecting clean and noisy samples. For model training, Delora can use
carefully selected samples to fine-tune language models seamlessly.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Delora in noisy label detection and text classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域部署时面临训练数据分布偏移的挑战，而领域特定微调需要高质量标注数据，这在专业知识有限的场景中成本高昂且收集缓慢。

Method: SyTTA框架在推理时耦合两种互补的不确定性信号：输入侧困惑度（反映与领域特定术语和模式的失配）和输出侧预测熵（反映生成过程中令牌概率的扩散和不稳定性），实现无需额外监督的实时适应。

Result: 在不同模型架构和领域特定基准测试中，SyTTA带来了持续的性能提升。在农业问答任务上，Qwen-2.5-7B模型的Rouge-LSum指标提高了超过120%，每查询仅需4个额外令牌。

Conclusion: 研究表明，无需标注示例即可实现语言模型的有效测试时适应，支持在标签稀缺领域的部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains
such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant
distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can
mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is
expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study
label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an
inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional
supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise
under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with
domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy,
indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across
diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers
consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves
Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query.
These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is
achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce
domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Method: 基于token目标预测任务，通过数据驱动和模型推导两种方法构建合成token目标：从数据中识别有意义的token，以及从LLM骨干网络中推导语义相关的token。

Result: 在MTEB v2基准测试中，Text2Token与使用无监督对比学习的最先进嵌入器LLM2Vec达到竞争性性能。分析显示词汇和表示空间在训练过程中共同优化并趋向最优解。

Conclusion: Text2Token证明了生成框架在无监督文本表示学习中的有效性，为未来工作提供了新的思路和见解，特别是词汇空间和表示空间的协同优化机制。

Abstract: Unsupervised text representation learning (TRL) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing, which is beneficial for improving search and
recommendations with the web's unlabeled texts. A recent empirical study finds
that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input
text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and
vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and
develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework
is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed
target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality
target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with
advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the
meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the
text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and
model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM
backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token
achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with
unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that
vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum
solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.

Conclusion: ImCoref-CeS成功整合了监督神经方法和LLM的优势，为共指消解任务提供了一个有效的混合解决方案

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Current research faces a key dilemma: whether to further explore the
potential of supervised neural methods based on small language models, whose
detect-then-cluster pipeline still delivers top performance, or embrace the
powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively
combining their strengths remains underexplored. To this end, we propose
\textbf{ImCoref-CeS}, a novel framework that integrates an enhanced supervised
model with LLM-based reasoning. First, we present an improved CR method
(\textbf{ImCoref}) to push the performance boundaries of the supervised neural
method by introducing a lightweight bridging module to enhance long-text
encoding capability, devising a biaffine scorer to comprehensively capture
positional information, and invoking a hybrid mention regularization to improve
training efficiency. Importantly, we employ an LLM acting as a multi-role
Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions (filtering out invalid
ones) and coreference results (splitting erroneous clusters) predicted by
ImCoref. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ImCoref-CeS,
which achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 提出了审计理解框架，通过验证前提条件来约束推理过程，解决大语言模型基于未经验证假设产生推理幻觉的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常生成看似连贯但基于未经验证假设的推理轨迹，导致产生幻觉结论。现有工作主要关注事实性幻觉或依赖事后验证，对推理引起的幻觉问题关注不足。

Method: 审计理解框架包含三个阶段：(1)将查询分解为候选假设，(2)审计这些假设的支持度，(3)仅基于已验证子集进行推理。该方法在形式上属于后验约束推理，与选择性预测和拒绝学习相关。

Result: 在GSM8K、MultiArith和SVAMP数据集上显著提升了准确性和忠实性，相比Chain-of-Thought、Self-Consistency和CoT-Decoding方法，在GSM8K上提升达+30%，MultiArith上+45%，SVAMP上持续提升20-28%。

Conclusion: 审计理解框架通过约束推理于已验证前提，有效减少了推理引起的幻觉，在理论和实证层面都证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear
coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated
conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on
post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely
unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that
constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1)
decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and
(3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is
\emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and
rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees
under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and
(iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and
faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on
GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over
Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding. Code is available at

Method: 两阶段过程：首先通过注入已知触发器聚集后门表示，然后进行恢复微调以恢复良性输出。

Result: 在多个基准测试中将平均攻击成功率降至4.41%，优于现有基线28.1%~69.3%；干净准确率和实用性保持在原始模型的0.5%以内。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to large language models (LLMs),
often embedded via public checkpoints, yet existing defenses rely on
impractical assumptions about trigger settings. To address this challenge, we
propose \ourmethod, a defense framework that requires no prior knowledge of
trigger settings. \ourmethod is based on the key observation that when
deliberately injecting known backdoors into an already-compromised model, both
existing unknown and newly injected backdoors aggregate in the representation
space. \ourmethod leverages this through a two-stage process: \textbf{first},
aggregating backdoor representations by injecting known triggers, and
\textbf{then}, performing recovery fine-tuning to restore benign outputs.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that: (I)

(II) Clean accuracy and utility are preserved within 0.5\% of the original

generalizes across different types of backdoors, confirming its robustness in
practical deployment scenarios.

*Yihong Liu,Mingyang Wang,François Yvon,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多语言大语言模型在跨语言事实知识回忆中的不一致性问题，发现实体对齐失败是主要原因，并提出了两种通过整合英文实体翻译来提升准确性和一致性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在跨语言事实知识回忆中存在不一致性，但导致这种不一致性的因素尚未被充分理解。作者假设这可能源于实体对齐的失败，即跨语言共享概念空间中主语和宾语实体的映射过程。

Method: 通过实体级翻译任务评估对齐效果，发现一致性与对齐强相关。提出SubSub和SubInj两种方法，在跨语言提示中整合英文主语翻译。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在事实回忆准确性和一致性方面均取得显著提升，通过模型内部枢纽语言处理强化了实体表示对齐。

Conclusion: 实体对齐是多语言事实预测一致性的关键因素，提出的干预策略通过强化概念空间中的实体表示对齐，为改进多语言事实预测提供了有效实用的方法。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are expected to recall factual
knowledge consistently across languages. However, the factors that give rise to
such crosslingual consistency -- and its frequent failure -- remain poorly
understood. In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise
from failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object
entities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we
assess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks,
and find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all
studied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting
in inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two
effective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts
across languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy
and consistency. Finally, our mechanistic analysis reveals that these
interventions reinforce the entity representation alignment in the conceptual
space through model's internal pivot-language processing, offering effective
and practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法如DeepConf虽然有效但计算开销大，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 递归利用模型内在的推理、验证和总结能力，增强正确解的保留并减少Pass@k与Pass@1之间的差距。

Result: 在多个开源模型和挑战性多模态推理基准测试中验证了方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 为高级语言模型的高效可扩展测试时推理策略设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
wherein additional computational resources are allocated during inference to
enhance model performance. Recent approaches, such as DeepConf, have
demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy, however, they often incur
substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results. In this
work, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces
computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
Specifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using
only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies
in the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in
reasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the
retention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and
Pass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and
challenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and
generality of our method. These findings offer new insights into the design of
efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language
models.

Motivation: 探究LLMs是否能在不同人口属性用户群体间展现公平的共情能力，因为情感体验受到人口统计和文化背景的影响。

Method: 提出了一个分析框架，通过315个独特人物角色（由年龄、文化和性别组合构成）对4个LLMs进行交叉分析，评估其认知和情感共情能力。

Result: 人口属性显著影响模型的共情回应，多属性叠加会减弱甚至逆转预期共情模式，模型总体上反映现实共情趋势，但在儒家文化等特定群体中存在明显偏差。

Conclusion: 需要设计考虑人口多样性的共情感知LLMs，以促进更具包容性和公平性的模型行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by
their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However,
emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This
raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across
diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive
and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting
demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis
spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture,
and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a
model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple
attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show
that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable
misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We
complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model
behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight
the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic
diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

Conclusion: 结合预训练语音编码器和LLM的端到端架构在语音翻译任务中表现出色，能够超越大型基础模型并媲美级联系统的性能。

Abstract: Speech Translation (ST) is a machine translation task that involves
converting speech signals from one language to the corresponding text in
another language; this task has two different approaches, namely the
traditional cascade and the more recent end-to-end. This paper explores a
combined end-to-end architecture of pre-trained speech encoders and Large
Language Models (LLMs) for performing both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
and ST simultaneously. Experiments with the English-to-German language pair
show that our best model not only can achieve better translation results than
SeamlessM4T, a large foundational end-to-end, multi-modal translation model,
but can also match the performance of a cascaded system with Whisper and NLLB,
with up to a score gain of 8% in $\text{COMET}^{\text{DA}}_{22}$ metric.

Motivation: RAG系统中语言模型基于有缺陷上下文选择性拒绝回答的能力对安全至关重要，但目前仍是显著的失败点，现有静态基准无法可靠评估这一能力。

Method: 引入RefusalBench生成方法，通过受控语言扰动编程创建诊断测试用例，采用176种扰动策略，涵盖六类信息不确定性和三个强度级别。

Result: 评估30多个模型发现系统性失败模式：拒绝能力包含可分离的检测和分类技能，规模和扩展推理无法提升性能，选择性拒绝是可训练的对齐敏感能力。

Conclusion: 选择性拒绝是可训练的对齐敏感能力，为改进提供了明确路径。发布了RefusalBench-NQ和RefusalBench-GaRAGe两个基准及完整生成框架，支持持续动态评估这一关键能力。

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer
based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant
failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle
in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document
tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static
benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit
dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce
RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic
test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs
176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational
uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers
systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and
categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves
performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive
capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks --
RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) --
and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation
of this critical capability.

Abstract: Accurate recall from large scale memories remains a core challenge for memory
augmented AI assistants performing question answering (QA), especially in
similarity dense scenarios where existing methods mainly rely on semantic
distance to the query for retrieval. Inspired by how humans link information
associatively, we propose AssoMem, a novel framework constructing an

extracted clues. This structure provides a rich organizational view of the
conversational context and facilitates importance aware ranking. Further,
AssoMem integrates multi-dimensional retrieval signals-relevance, importance,

strategy. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and a newly introduced
dataset, MeetingQA, demonstrate that AssoMem consistently outperforms SOTA
baselines, verifying its superiority in context-aware memory recall.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法主要关注词级似然优化，缺乏语义连贯性，导致编辑后的知识在潜在空间中作为孤立残差流存在，绕过自然推理过程

Method: STEAM首先识别目标表示作为更新事实关联的语义锚点，然后通过对齐损失在优化过程中引导编辑事实的内部表示向这些锚点对齐

Result: 实验结果表明STEAM提高了模型使用编辑知识进行推理的能力，并增强了语义连贯性

Conclusion: 潜在空间对齐对于可靠和连贯的知识编辑至关重要，STEAM框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Large Language Models store extensive factual knowledge acquired during
large-scale pre-training. However, this knowledge is inherently static,
reflecting only the state of the world at the time of training. Knowledge
editing has emerged as a promising solution for updating outdated or incorrect
facts without full retraining. However, most existing locate-and-edit methods
primarily focus on token-level likelihood optimization without addressing
semantic coherence. Our analysis reveals that such edited knowledge is often
encoded as isolated residual streams in the model's latent space, distinct from
pre-existing knowledge and bypassing natural reasoning process. To address
this, we propose \textsc{Steam}, a semantic-level knowledge editing framework
that enhances integration of updated knowledge into the model's knowledge
structure. \textsc{Steam} first identifies target representations as semantic
anchors for the updated factual association, then guides the internal
representation of the edited fact towards these anchors through an alignment
loss during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{Steam}
improves model's ability to reason with edited knowledge and enhances semantic
coherence, underscoring the importance of latent-space alignment for reliable
and coherent knowledge editing. The code is available at

TL;DR: LongQAEval是一个用于评估长格式临床问答系统的框架，通过比较粗粒度答案级和细粒度句子级评估方法，发现在正确性维度上细粒度标注更好，相关性维度上粗粒度更好，安全性评估仍不一致，且标注少量句子即可达到与粗粒度标注相当的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估长格式临床问答系统资源密集且具有挑战性，需要医学专业知识，且在长文本上难以获得一致的人类判断。

Method: 基于医生对300个真实患者问题的标注，比较了粗粒度答案级和细粒度句子级评估方法，分析了正确性、相关性和安全性三个维度的评分者间一致性。

Result: 评分者间一致性因维度而异：细粒度标注在正确性维度上表现更好，粗粒度在相关性维度上表现更好，安全性判断仍不一致。标注少量句子即可达到与粗粒度标注相当的可靠性。

Conclusion: LongQAEval提供了一个在有限资源和高专业知识环境下的评估框架，建议根据评估维度选择合适的标注粒度，并可通过标注少量句子来降低成本和努力。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form clinical question answering (QA) systems is
resource-intensive and challenging: accurate judgments require medical
expertise and achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text is
difficult. We introduce LongQAEval, an evaluation framework and set of
evaluation recommendations for limited-resource and high-expertise settings.
Based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by
physicians and LLMs, we compare coarse answer-level versus fine-grained
sentence-level evaluation over the dimensions of correctness, relevance, and
safety. We find that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) varies by dimension:
fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves
agreement on relevance, and judgments on safety remain inconsistent.
Additionally, annotating only a small subset of sentences can provide
reliability comparable to coarse annotations, reducing cost and effort.

Motivation: 研究旨在探究大型音频语言模型是否真正处理声学信息，还是主要依赖词汇内容进行情感理解。

Method: 开发LISTEN基准测试，通过控制词汇和声学线索的对齐与冲突来评估模型表现，测试了6个最先进的LALMs。

Result: 模型在词汇线索中性或缺失时预测"中性"，线索对齐时改进有限，线索冲突时无法区分不同情感，在副语言情境中表现接近随机。

Conclusion: 当前LALMs主要依赖词汇语义而未能充分利用声学线索，更像是"转录"而非"聆听"，LISTEN为多模态模型情感理解评估提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and
acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models
(LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical
content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in
Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance
from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six
state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models
predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains
under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict.
In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results
indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying
heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers
a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal
models.

Motivation: 传统基于强化学习的RAG系统存在上下文管理效率低下的问题，长而嘈杂的检索文档会增加成本并降低性能。

Method: 引入显式摘要模块压缩证据，采用两阶段训练：在QA数据集上进行相关性预训练，然后从专有LLM进行多方面蒸馏以确保事实性和清晰度。

Result: 在Search-R1管道中，RECON将总上下文长度减少35%，3B模型平均EM分数提升14.5%，7B模型提升3.0%，在多跳QA中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 学习到的上下文压缩对于构建实用、可扩展和高性能的RAG系统至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems trained using reinforcement
learning (RL) with reasoning are hampered by inefficient context management,
where long, noisy retrieved documents increase costs and degrade performance.
We introduce RECON (REasoning with CONdensation), a framework that integrates
an explicit summarization module to compress evidence within the reasoning
loop. Our summarizer is trained via a two-stage process: relevance pretraining
on QA datasets, followed by multi-aspect distillation from proprietary LLMs to
ensure factuality and clarity. Integrated into the Search-R1 pipeline, RECON
reduces total context length by 35\%, leading to improved training speed and
inference latency, while simultaneously improving RAG performance on downstream
QA benchmarks. Notably, it boosts the average EM score of the 3B model by
14.5\% and the 7B model by 3.0\%, showing particular strength in multi-hop QA.
RECON demonstrates that learned context compression is essential for building
practical, scalable, and performant RAG systems. Our code implementation is

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型的安全对齐会导致过度拒绝，即模型会拒绝良性请求。在检索增强生成中，查询意图和检索上下文属性都会影响拒绝行为，需要系统分析这种现象。

Method: 构建RagRefuse基准，涵盖医疗、化学和开放领域，配对良性和有害查询，控制上下文污染模式和大小。提出SafeRAG-Steering方法，通过模型中心嵌入干预在推理时将嵌入区域导向确认安全的非拒绝输出区域。

Result: 分析显示上下文安排/污染、查询和上下文领域、有害文本密度都会触发对良性查询的拒绝，效果取决于模型特定的对齐选择。SafeRAG-Steering方法能在保持合法拒绝的同时减少污染RAG管道中的过度拒绝。

Conclusion: 安全对齐会导致LLMs在RAG中过度拒绝良性请求，上下文污染是重要因素。提出的SafeRAG-Steering方法能有效缓解这一问题，平衡安全性和可用性。

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) induces over-refusals --
where LLMs decline benign requests due to aggressive safety filters. We analyze
this phenomenon in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where both the query
intent and retrieved context properties influence refusal behavior. We
construct RagRefuse, a domain-stratified benchmark spanning medical, chemical,
and open domains, pairing benign and harmful queries with controlled context
contamination patterns and sizes. Our analysis shows that context arrangement /
contamination, domain of query and context, and harmful-text density trigger
refusals even on benign queries, with effects depending on model-specific
alignment choices. To mitigate over-refusals, we introduce
\textsc{SafeRAG-Steering}, a model-centric embedding intervention that steers
the embedding regions towards the confirmed safe, non-refusing output regions
at inference time. This reduces over-refusals in contaminated RAG pipelines
while preserving legitimate refusals.

Motivation: 解决语音识别中语音长度与文本长度不匹配的挑战，特别是在两者长度相近的情况下，传统CTC方法无法有效对齐语音和文本。

Method: 提出了两种对齐方法：时间独立损失(TIL)和对齐交叉熵损失(AXELoss)，并引入帧融合技术，通过加权求和关键帧及其上下文2帧来增强关键帧信息。

Conclusion: 提出的TIL和AXELoss方法有效解决了语音与文本对齐问题，显著减少了处理所需的帧数，提高了语音识别性能。

Abstract: The mismatch of speech length and text length poses a challenge in automatic
speech recognition (ASR). In previous research, various approaches have been
employed to align text with speech, including the utilization of Connectionist
Temporal Classification (CTC). In earlier work, a key frame mechanism (KFDS)
was introduced, utilizing intermediate CTC outputs to guide downsampling and
preserve keyframes, but traditional methods (CTC) failed to align speech and
text appropriately when downsampling speech to a text-similar length. In this
paper, we focus on speech recognition in those cases where the length of speech
aligns closely with that of the corresponding text. To address this issue, we
introduce two methods for alignment: a) Time Independence Loss (TIL) and b)
Aligned Cross Entropy (AXE) Loss, which is based on edit distance. To enhance
the information on keyframes, we incorporate frame fusion by applying weights
and summing the keyframe with its context 2 frames. Experimental results on
AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 dataset subsets show that the proposed methods
outperform the previous work and achieve a reduction of at least 86\% in the
number of frames.

Conclusion: EssenceBench方法在压缩效率和排名保持方面优于现有方法，能够显著减少基准规模同时保持评估准确性

Abstract: As the demand for comprehensive evaluations of diverse model capabilities
steadily increases, benchmark suites have correspondingly grown significantly
in scale. Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level
performance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates
these methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is
still largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis
of benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be
eliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem
with the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose
EssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic
Algorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and
attribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach
yields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and
markedly higher efficiency. In particular, on the HellaSwag benchmark (10K
samples), our method preserves the ranking of all models shifting within 5%
using 25x fewer samples, and achieves 95% ranking preservation shifting within
5% using only 200x fewer samples.

Abstract: Digital communication has become the cornerstone of modern interaction,
enabling rapid, accessible, and interactive exchanges. However, individuals
with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the
"digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic
metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends
academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages
principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models
(LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded
in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables
the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts.
Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200
semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and
validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible
learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves
underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

TL;DR: 提出了FML-bench基准测试，用于评估自动机器学习研究代理在8个基础机器学习研究问题上的表现，解决了现有基准测试在学术严谨性、任务多样性和可扩展性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过度强调工程方面而忽视学术严谨性，任务多样性不足，过于关注应用导向任务而非基础研究问题，且难以扩展到真实研究环境。

Method: 开发了FML-bench基准测试，包含8个多样化的基础机器学习研究问题，减少编码负担，强调基础问题而非特定用例，并提供可扩展性。同时提出了包含5个互补指标的评估框架。

Result: 评估了最先进的自动研究代理，发现采用广泛研究探索策略的代理优于那些专注于狭窄但深入探索的代理。

Conclusion: 强调探索广度可能比仅关注增量改进带来更有效的研究成果，FML-bench为评估自动机器学习研究代理提供了更全面的基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in automatic
machine learning research agents. Among them, agents capable of autonomously
proposing ideas and conducting machine learning experiments are particularly
promising, as they maximize research automation and accelerate scientific
progress by iteratively refining ideas based on experimental results. However,
comprehensively evaluating such agents remains challenging. Existing benchmarks
tend to overemphasize engineering aspects while neglecting academic rigor,
creating barriers that obscure a clear assessment of an agent's scientific
capabilities in machine learning research. They also suffer from limited task
diversity, an overemphasis on application-oriented tasks over fundamental
research problems, and limited scalability to realistic research settings. To
address these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and
fundamental machine learning research problems. It reduces coding burden,
emphasizes fundamental problems rather than specific use cases, offers high
task diversity, and is extensible to real-world machine learning GitHub
repositories. Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five
complementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on
our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on
FML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies
outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings
suggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective
research outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement. Our benchmark
is available at https://github.com/qrzou/FML-bench.

*A H M Rezaul Karim,Ozlem Uzuner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了MasonNLP团队在MEDIQA-OE 2025医疗订单提取任务中的方法，使用通用LLaMA-4 17B模型通过单样本提示工程实现医疗订单结构化提取，在17个团队中排名第5。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗订单提取对于结构化临床信息、支持决策制定和实现文档及工作流自动化至关重要。该任务需要从多样化医疗数据源中提取结构化订单信息。

Method: 使用通用指令调优的LLaMA-4 17B模型，不进行领域特定微调，仅通过单个上下文示例进行引导的少样本配置。

Result: 在17个参赛团队的105份提交中排名第5，平均F1分数为37.76，在原因和来源准确性方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: 大型非领域特定LLM与有效提示工程结合，可作为专业临床NLP任务的可扩展强基线。

Abstract: Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical
information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications
such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in
diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and
multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as
medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The
MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from
extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order
type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission,
which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our
approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without
domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This
few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable
improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that
large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering,
can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过后训练技术扩展扩散LLMs上下文窗口的方法，无需从头训练，成功将上下文扩展到128K token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散LLMs在长上下文行为方面的研究仍然不足，需要探索如何有效扩展其上下文窗口。

Method: 通过修改标准RoPE位置编码来适应扩散过程的概率建模，比较不同的掩码策略对优化稳定性和长程记忆的影响。

Result: 提出的UltraLLaDA模型在长上下文任务中显著优于无需训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: 特殊的位置扩展技术是扩展扩散LLMs上下文窗口的关键杠杆，为通过高效后训练实现128K规模上下文提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have attracted growing interest, with plenty of recent work
emphasizing their great potential in various downstream tasks; yet the
long-context behavior of diffusion LLMs remains largely uncharted. We present a
case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of
diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a
simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)
extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the
diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further
compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact
on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights,
we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that,
in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms
training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special
positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended
contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale
context via efficient post-training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的OCR方法VOLTAGE，用于低资源语言的数字保护，在Takri脚本上达到95%的印刷体和87%的手写体识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球7000种语言中有2500种濒危，语言消失会导致传统智慧、民间文学和社区本质的丧失。低资源语言由于缺乏无监督OCR方法而面临更大的灭绝风险。

Method: 使用对比学习和自动字形特征推荐进行聚类标注，通过图像变换和生成对抗网络增强标注数据的多样性和数量。

Result: 在Takri脚本上，印刷体识别准确率达到95%，手写体达到87%。该方法在其他印度语系脚本上也表现出通用性。

Conclusion: VOLTAGE方法为低资源语言的数字包容提供了有效解决方案，通过基线研究和消融实验验证了其有效性，并构建了下游应用案例。

Abstract: UNESCO has classified 2500 out of 7000 languages spoken worldwide as
endangered. Attrition of a language leads to loss of traditional wisdom, folk
literature, and the essence of the community that uses it. It is therefore
imperative to bring digital inclusion to these languages and avoid its
extinction. Low resource languages are at a greater risk of extinction. Lack of
unsupervised Optical Character Recognition(OCR) methodologies for low resource
languages is one of the reasons impeding their digital inclusion. We propose
VOLTAGE - a contrastive learning based OCR methodology, leveraging auto-glyph
feature recommendation for cluster-based labelling. We augment the labelled
data for diversity and volume using image transformations and Generative
Adversarial Networks. Voltage has been designed using Takri - a family of
scripts used in 16th to 20th century in the Himalayan regions of India. We
present results for Takri along with other Indic scripts (both low and high
resource) to substantiate the universal behavior of the methodology. An
accuracy of 95% for machine printed and 87% for handwritten samples on Takri
script has been achieved. We conduct baseline and ablation studies along with
building downstream use cases for Takri, demonstrating the usefulness of our
work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理复杂推理任务时会产生冗长的思考过程，导致计算和延迟开销过高，阻碍实际部署。

Method: 提出AdvPrompt框架，通过迭代优化的黑盒对抗提示技术，从多角度生成高质量提示，引导模型给出更简洁的响应。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AdvPrompt显著减少token使用量：Qwen3系列在GSM8K上响应长度减少3倍，四个基准平均减少约40%token；Claude-3.7和Gemini-2.5在MATH-500上分别减少35%和47%token。

Conclusion: AdvPrompt展示了黑盒提示作为提高大型推理模型效率的实用有效策略，具有良好的跨模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
tackling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step thinking. However, such a
lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency
overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we
present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box
adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs
as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses
without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement
framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse
perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt
consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably,
AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on simple GSM8K
questions for the Qwen3 model series, and delivers an average ~40% token
reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces
token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5. Further
analysis reveals the generalizability of AdvPrompt across various model scales
and families, underscoring the potential of black-box prompting as a practical
and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency.

TL;DR: AuthenHallu是首个完全基于真实LLM-人类对话构建的幻觉检测基准，相比人工构造的基准能更真实反映实际使用中的幻觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测基准多为人工构造，无法真实反映LLM在实际使用中的幻觉特征，需要基于真实对话构建更可靠的基准。

Method: 从真实的LLM-人类对话中选择样本进行标注，构建AuthenHallu基准，并分析幻觉分布特征，同时探索使用普通LLM作为幻觉检测器的潜力。

Result: 统计显示31.4%的查询-响应对存在幻觉，在数学和数字问题等挑战性领域这一比例高达60.0%。普通LLM作为检测器表现有潜力但尚不充分。

Conclusion: 基于真实对话的基准能更准确反映LLM幻觉特征，当前LLM作为幻觉检测器的性能仍需改进，AuthenHallu为未来研究提供了更可靠的评估基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in sensitive domains
such as medicine and law, hallucination detection has become a critical task.
Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this
area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate
hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from
genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully
capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage.
To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination
detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For
AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues,
thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday
user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in
31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion
increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number
Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs
themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise,
their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理开放域问题时，由于依赖固定的动作序列，难以应对需要大量信息检索的多跳推理任务

Method: 基于关键实体构建初始节点，通过历史错误分析和实时反馈动态生成推理子节点，结合深度优先搜索和创新的节点生成技术

Result: 在HotpotQA数据集上达到54.47% F1分数，StrategyQA数据集上达到70.05%，分别比最佳基线提升5.03%和7.25%

Conclusion: FGDIP框架通过动态策略有效扩展搜索空间，确保推理过程系统性地收敛到准确解，展现了在多跳推理任务中的潜力和通用性

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements
in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with
handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due
to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose
Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework
tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive
strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning
tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,
which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial
nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined
through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,
which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning
strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node
generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and
concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic
strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning
process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental
results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset
and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and
7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance
language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: BitMar是一个量化多模态transformer，使用1.58位编码器和外部情景记忆，在资源受限的硬件上实现高效的图像-文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨注意力transformer和多模态视觉语言模型虽然擅长grounding和生成，但其全精度骨干网络难以在边缘设备上部署。内存增强架构很少与激进的边缘导向量化结合使用。

Method: 使用1.58位编码器（文本用BitNet风格，视觉用DiNOv2基础）创建紧凑嵌入，结合固定大小的键值情景记忆。解码器采用逐层条件化和滑动窗口注意力机制处理长输入。

Result: 实现了竞争性的captioning和多模态理解能力，在低延迟和小模型占用下达到良好的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: BitMar的特性使其非常适合边缘部署。

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models
excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision
backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented
architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works
rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce
BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like
episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited
resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and
one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined
and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector
retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases
the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs
attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming
inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning
and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off,
delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency
with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for
edge deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型难以有效捕捉主题随时间的动态演化过程，需要系统性地建模语义表示与时间演化的统一框架。

Method: 使用大语言模型获取文本上下文嵌入，引入时间衰减函数和注意力机制调整语义单元重要性，在潜在主题空间应用状态转移矩阵描述主题动态演化，通过联合优化目标约束语义建模和时间一致性。

Result: 在真实语料上的实验表明，该框架能有效捕捉主题的生成、扩展和衰退过程，在多个指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解大规模文本中的动态语义模式提供了系统解决方案，丰富了主题建模的研究范式，支持多领域的复杂文本分析任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes a modeling framework for dynamic topic evolution based on
temporal large language models. The method first uses a large language model to
obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay
function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust
the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic
variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then
mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to
describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective
constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity
and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling
of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic
coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over
time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively
captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms
existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides
a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in
large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and
supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.

Motivation: 现有压缩方法虽然认识到校准数据的重要性，但对其如何影响压缩后LLM能力的研究不够系统，特别是在复杂推理能力方面的影响机制尚不明确。

Method: 从激活模式角度分析校准数据的影响机制，探索其对数学问题解决和代码生成等高级推理能力的影响，并提出基于激活空间代表性和多样性的校准数据筛选框架。

Result: 研究发现激活空间中的代表性和多样性更根本地决定了校准数据的质量，提出的数据筛选框架能够有效提升现有后训练压缩方法在保留关键LLM能力方面的性能。

Conclusion: 校准数据的质量不仅取决于数据来源和样本数量，更重要的是其在激活空间中的代表性和多样性，这为改进后训练压缩方法提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: Post-training compression has been a widely employed approach to scale down
large language model (LLM) and facilitate efficient inference. In various
proposed compression methods, including pruning and quantization, calibration
data plays a vital role by informing the weight importance and activation
dynamic ranges. However, how calibration data impacts the LLM capability after
compression is less explored. Few of the existing works, though recognizing the
significance of this study, only investigate the language modeling or
commonsense reasoning performance degradation from limited angles, like the
data sources or sample amounts. More systematic research is still needed to
examine the impacts on different LLM capabilities in terms of compositional
properties and domain correspondence of calibration data. In this work, we aim
at bridging this gap and further analyze underlying influencing mechanisms from
the activation pattern perspective. Especially, we explore the calibration
data's impacts on high-level complex reasoning capabilities, like math problem
solving and code generation. Delving into the underlying mechanism, we find
that the representativeness and diversity in activation space more
fundamentally determine the quality of calibration data. Finally, we propose a
calibration data curation framework based on such observations and analysis,
enhancing the performance of existing post-training compression methods on
preserving critical LLM capabilities. Our code is provided in

Motivation: 研究事实主张如何变得可信，探索事实陈述被外部来源或证据锚定的方式，填补了现有研究仅关注主张检测和验证的空白。

Method: 构建了FactAppeal数据集，包含3,226个英文新闻句子的手动标注，识别事实陈述和依赖的来源提及，并采用2B-9B参数范围的编码器和生成解码器模型进行建模。

Result: 最佳模型基于Gemma 2 9B，实现了0.73的宏F1分数，能够有效识别事实陈述的认知结构和证据基础。

Conclusion: 认知吸引力识别是一个重要且可行的任务，FactAppeal数据集和基准模型为理解事实主张的可信度提供了新的研究基础。

Abstract: How is a factual claim made credible? We propose the novel task of Epistemic
Appeal Identification, which identifies whether and how factual statements have
been anchored by external sources or evidence. To advance research on this
task, we present FactAppeal, a manually annotated dataset of 3,226
English-language news sentences. Unlike prior resources that focus solely on
claim detection and verification, FactAppeal identifies the nuanced epistemic
structures and evidentiary basis underlying these claims and used to support
them. FactAppeal contains span-level annotations which identify factual
statements and mentions of sources on which they rely. Moreover, the
annotations include fine-grained characteristics of factual appeals such as the
type of source (e.g. Active Participant, Witness, Expert, Direct Evidence),
whether it is mentioned by name, mentions of the source's role and epistemic
credentials, attribution to the source via direct or indirect quotation, and
other features. We model the task with a range of encoder models and generative
decoder models in the 2B-9B parameter range. Our best performing model, based
on Gemma 2 9B, achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.73.

Method: 采用文章匹配策略比较同一事件的报道，应用FactAppeal框架分析47万篇关于COVID-19疫情和以色列-哈马斯战争的文章。

Result: CNN的报道包含更多事实陈述且更倾向于引用外部来源，主要引用专家和专家文件构建正式权威；福克斯新闻则更偏好新闻报道和直接引用。

Conclusion: 研究量化了党派媒体使用系统性不同的认知策略来构建现实，为媒体偏见研究增添了新维度。

Abstract: While media bias is widely studied, the epistemic strategies behind factual
reporting remain computationally underexplored. This paper analyzes these
strategies through a large-scale comparison of CNN and Fox News. To isolate
reporting style from topic selection, we employ an article matching strategy to
compare reports on the same events and apply the FactAppeal framework to a
corpus of over 470K articles covering two highly politicized periods: the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Israel-Hamas war. We find that CNN's reporting
contains more factual statements and is more likely to ground them in external
sources. The outlets also exhibit sharply divergent sourcing patterns: CNN
builds credibility by citing Experts} and Expert Documents, constructing an
appeal to formal authority, whereas Fox News favors News Reports and direct
quotations. This work quantifies how partisan outlets use systematically
different epistemic strategies to construct reality, adding a new dimension to
the study of media bias.

Motivation: 解决传统单体架构在复杂推理和多样化数据库模式下的局限性，提升文本到SQL生成的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 采用多专家代理框架，包括推理代理进行问题分解、编码代理生成子查询、优化步骤进行列选择，以及自适应路由器在模块化流水线和基线解析器之间进行选择。

Result: 在Spider基准测试中，使用14B参数模型达到86.07%的执行准确率，接近GPT-4的89.65%水平，同时提升了可解释性。

Conclusion: AGENTIQL提供了一个鲁棒、可扩展且可解释的语义解析方法，通过模块化设计和并行处理能力缩小了与GPT-4等大型模型的性能差距。

Abstract: LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures
struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an
agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for
question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a
refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances
efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a
baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel,
making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider
benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and
achieves up to 86.07\% EX with 14B models using the Planner&Executor merging
strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the
routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX)
while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances
transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust,
scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.

Motivation: 现有方法如Search-R1和WebDancer依赖额外工具将交互式网络环境转换为静态文本内容，这与人类浏览行为不符。需要开发更接近人类交互方式的网络代理。

Method: 采用两阶段训练（监督微调和拒绝微调），通过Playwright预定义浏览器操作集，并引入显式记忆机制存储关键结论以增强长时任务推理能力。

rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static
text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve
diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing.
In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves
complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates
directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser
actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities.
Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent
achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally,
we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across
steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon
tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over
Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These
results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for
more interactive and scalable web agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ConsistentGuard，一种基于推理的多语言保护方法，通过推理增强可解释性，通过对齐促进语言间知识迁移，仅需1000个训练样本即可在6种语言的3个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM保护方法主要依赖基于分类器的方法，缺乏可解释性且在低资源语言上表现不佳，需要解决这些局限性。

Method: 使用基于推理的方法，通过推理增强可解释性，通过对齐促进语言间知识迁移，仅需少量训练样本。

Result: 仅用1000个训练样本，在6种语言的3个数据集上表现优异，超越了使用更多数据训练的大型模型，并展现出强大的可解释性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ConsistentGuard方法有效解决了现有LLM保护方法的局限性，提供了多语言基准扩展并开源代码以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enhanced AI capabilities, but also increased the
risk posed by malicious requests, highlighting the need for effective LLM
safeguards to detect such queries. Existing approaches largely rely on
classifier-based methods that lack interpretability and perform poorly on
low-resource languages. To address these limitations, we propose
ConsistentGuard, a novel reasoning-based multilingual safeguard, which enhances
explainability via reasoning and boosts knowledge transfer between languages
through alignment. With only 1,000 training samples, our method demonstrates
superior performance on three datasets across six languages, outperforming
larger models trained with significantly more data, and exhibits strong
interpretability and generalization ability. We also contribute a multilingual
benchmark extension and release our codes to support future research.

*Zichun Yu,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RePro是一种新颖的网页数据回收方法，使用强化学习训练小型语言模型来生成高质量、忠实于原意的重述数据，显著提升预训练数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量预训练数据是大型语言模型的"化石燃料"，但前沿模型的可用数据储备正在枯竭，需要开发有效的数据回收方法。

Method: 使用强化学习训练4B参数的重述模型，设计一个质量奖励和三个忠实度奖励，将原始数据转换为高质量重述版本，同时保持核心语义和结构。

Result: 在400M和1.4B模型上，RePro相比仅使用原始数据的基线，在22个下游任务上带来4.7%-14.0%的相对准确率提升，数据效率提高2-3倍。

Conclusion: RePro提供了一条高效可控的路径，有效利用LLM预训练的"化石燃料"，在保持数据忠实性的同时显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: High-quality pretraining data is the fossil fuel of large language models
(LLMs), yet its reserves are running low for frontier models. In this paper, we
introduce RePro, a novel web recycling method that trains a relatively small LM
with reinforcement learning to generate effective and faithful rephrasings of
pretraining data. Specifically, we design one quality reward and three
faithfulness rewards, optimizing the LM rephraser to convert organic data into
high-quality rephrasings while maintaining its core semantics and structure. In
our experiment, we train a 4B rephraser to recycle 72B tokens sampled from
DCLM-RefinedWeb. Pretraining results on 400M and 1.4B models demonstrate that
RePro delivers 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy gains over organic-only baseline on
22 downstream tasks. RePro also outperforms ReWire, the state-of-the-art web
recycling method that prompts a 70B rephraser, as well as the organic baseline
with a 4x larger data pool. Experiments with different amounts of recycled data
highlight that RePro improves organic data efficiency by 2-3x. Individual and
distributional analyses validate that RePro preserves more critical information
and faithfully reflects the characteristics of organic data compared to
prompting-based methods. Together, these results show that RePro provides an
efficient and controllable path to effectively harness the fossil fuel of LLM
pretraining. We open-source our code, rephraser, and recycled data at
https://github.com/cxcscmu/RePro.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度卷积神经网络和BERT的模块化深度学习框架，用于文本反讽检测，整合了情感分析、上下文嵌入、语言特征提取和情感检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反讽是一种微妙且常被误解的交流形式，特别是在缺乏语调和肢体语言的文本中，需要开发有效的检测方法。

Method: 使用深度卷积神经网络和BERT等上下文模型，通过多层架构整合情感分析、上下文嵌入、语言特征提取和情感检测。

Result: 虽然模型仍处于概念阶段，但证明了在聊天机器人和社交媒体分析等实际应用中的可行性。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架展示了在现实世界应用中检测文本反讽的潜力，为未来开发提供了基础。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a nuanced and often misinterpreted form of communication,
especially in text, where tone and body language are absent. This paper
proposes a modular deep learning framework for sarcasm detection, leveraging
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and contextual models such as BERT
to analyze linguistic, emotional, and contextual cues. The system integrates
sentiment analysis, contextual embeddings, linguistic feature extraction, and
emotion detection through a multi-layer architecture. While the model is in the
conceptual stage, it demonstrates feasibility for real-world applications such
as chatbots and social media analysis.

TL;DR: LLMs在方法学评估中表现接近人类专家，但复杂推理任务准确率下降15%，需要人类监督结合自动化提取来提高证据合成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统评价工作量大，特别是提取方法学信息。LLMs有潜力自动化方法学评估，改变证据合成方式。

Method: 以因果中介分析为代表领域，在180篇全文科学文章中，将最先进LLMs与人类专家评审进行基准测试。

Result: 模型性能与人类判断高度相关（准确率相关性0.71；F1相关性0.97），在明确陈述的方法学标准上达到接近人类准确率，但在复杂推理评估中准确率显著下降15%。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs擅长识别明确方法学特征，但需要人类监督进行细致解释。自动化信息提取与专家评审结合是提高证据合成效率和严谨性的有前景方法。

Abstract: Systematic reviews are crucial for synthesizing scientific evidence but
remain labor-intensive, especially when extracting detailed methodological
information. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating
methodological assessments, promising to transform evidence synthesis. Here,
using causal mediation analysis as a representative methodological domain, we
benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180
full-text scientific articles. Model performance closely correlated with human
judgments (accuracy correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving
near-human accuracy on straightforward, explicitly stated methodological
criteria. However, accuracy sharply declined on complex, inference-intensive
assessments, lagging expert reviewers by up to 15%. Errors commonly resulted
from superficial linguistic cues -- for instance, models frequently
misinterpreted keywords like "longitudinal" or "sensitivity" as automatic
evidence of rigorous methodological approache, leading to systematic
misclassifications. Longer documents yielded lower model accuracy, whereas
publication year showed no significant effect. Our findings highlight an
important pattern for practitioners using LLMs for methods review and synthesis
from full texts: current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological
features but require human oversight for nuanced interpretations. Integrating
automated information extraction with targeted expert review thus provides a
promising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in evidence
synthesis across diverse scientific fields.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了HiligayNER，这是第一个用于希利盖农语命名实体识别的公开基线模型，基于超过8000个标注句子构建，使用mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa模型微调，在各项指标上达到80%以上性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希利盖农语作为菲律宾的一种代表性语言，在语言处理研究中代表性不足，缺乏标注语料库和基线模型。

Method: 从公开新闻文章、社交媒体帖子和文学文本收集超过8000个标注句子，使用mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa两种基于Transformer的模型进行微调。

Result: 两个模型在所有实体类型上的精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过80%，与宿务语和他加禄语的跨语言评估显示出良好的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为代表性不足的菲律宾语言（特别是希利盖农语）的语言技术发展做出了贡献，支持了低资源环境下多语言NLP的进一步研究。

Abstract: The language of Hiligaynon, spoken predominantly by the people of Panay
Island, Negros Occidental, and Soccsksargen in the Philippines, remains
underrepresented in language processing research due to the absence of
annotated corpora and baseline models. This study introduces HiligayNER, the
first publicly available baseline model for the task of Named Entity
Recognition (NER) in Hiligaynon. The dataset used to build HiligayNER contains
over 8,000 annotated sentences collected from publicly available news articles,
social media posts, and literary texts. Two Transformer-based models, mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa, were fine-tuned on this collected corpus to build versions of
HiligayNER. Evaluation results show strong performance, with both models
achieving over 80% in precision, recall, and F1-score across entity types.
Furthermore, cross-lingual evaluation with Cebuano and Tagalog demonstrates
promising transferability, suggesting the broader applicability of HiligayNER
for multilingual NLP in low-resource settings. This work aims to contribute to
language technology development for underrepresented Philippine languages,
specifically for Hiligaynon, and support future research in regional language
processing.

TL;DR: 这篇综述系统性地调查了推理时扩展技术，将这一快速发展的领域组织为输出导向和输入导向两大视角，详细分析了各种方法及其应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高质量训练数据的快速减少，研究重点从模型规模扩展转向推理时扩展，通过在部署时使用额外计算来显著提升LLM性能，而无需昂贵的模型重新训练。

Method: 将推理时扩展技术分为输出导向方法（包括复杂多步生成策略、推理方法、搜索解码方法、长CoT训练和模型集成）和输入导向方法（主要关注少样本学习和RAG，其中RAG部分详细分析了查询扩展、数据、检索与重排序、LLM生成方法和多模态RAG）。

Result: 系统性地组织了推理时扩展的多样化技术，为这一新兴领域提供了全面的分类框架和分析视角。

Conclusion: 推理时扩展代表了LLM发展的新范式，通过部署时的额外计算有效解决了高质量训练数据稀缺的问题，为LLM性能提升提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up
model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of
high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting
the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses
additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM
performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review
systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of
inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two
comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods.
Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies,
including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding
methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO),
and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized
by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further
detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval
and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP评估指标（如BLEU、FKGL、SARI）主要捕捉表面特征，无法衡量人类中心的质量，如清晰度、可信度、文化相关性等，这在健康沟通等高风险环境中尤为关键。

Method: 提出人类中心可读性评分（HCRS），一个基于人机交互和健康沟通研究的五维评估框架，整合自动测量与结构化人类反馈，捕捉可读性的关系和情境方面。

Result: 概述了HCRS框架，讨论了其在参与式评估工作流程中的整合，并提出了实证验证协议。

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在推动健康文本简化评估超越表面指标，使NLP系统更贴近不同用户的需求、期望和生活经验。

Abstract: Text simplification is essential for making public health information
accessible to diverse populations, including those with limited health
literacy. However, commonly used evaluation metrics in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), such as BLEU, FKGL, and SARI, mainly capture surface-level
features and fail to account for human-centered qualities like clarity,
trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability. This limitation
is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication
must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To
address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a
five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures
with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects
of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into
participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical
validation. This work aims to advance the evaluation of health text
simplification beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems that align more
closely with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

*Mihir Gupte,Paolo Giusto,Ramesh S*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自底向上的方法，用于将树状结构（如GitHub仓库）的知识线性化，通过在每个层级生成隐式聚合摘要，使知识能够存储在知识库中并与RAG直接使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs擅长基于上下文信息生成响应，但对于结构化数据（特别是树状层次结构），如何最佳地表示检索到的知识以生成响应尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用自底向上的方法，在树状结构的每个层级生成隐式、聚合的摘要，将层次知识线性化，然后与RAG结合使用。

Result: 与在原始非结构化代码上使用RAG相比，虽然响应质量相当，但该方法在检索器中生成的文档数量减少了68%以上，效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用隐式线性化知识可能是处理复杂层次数据结构的高效且可扩展策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on
information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting
with structured data like code files, another popular method,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment
the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best
represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,
particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a
novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a
GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each
hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a
knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using
RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the
generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable
across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the
retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that
leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and
scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了不同音译方法对多语言NLP模型性能的影响，发现罗马化在大多数情况下表现最佳，主要原因是能产生与预训练语言共享的更长子词标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同音译方法（共享脚本、重叠词汇、共享音系）对多语言模型性能的贡献程度，以弥合使用非拉丁文字语言之间的差距。

Method: 使用三种音译方法（罗马化、音位转录、替换密码）以及正字法进行受控实验，在命名实体识别和自然语言推理两个下游任务上评估模型性能。

Result: 罗马化在8个评估设置中的7个显著优于其他输入类型，验证了其作为最有效方法的假设。

Conclusion: 罗马化是最有效的音译方法，其成功主要归因于能产生与预训练语言共享的更长子词标记，从而更好地利用模型能力。

Abstract: Transliteration has emerged as a promising means to bridge the gap between
various languages in multilingual NLP, showing promising results especially for
languages using non-Latin scripts. We investigate the degree to which shared
script, overlapping token vocabularies, and shared phonology contribute to
performance of multilingual models. To this end, we conduct controlled
experiments using three kinds of transliteration (romanization, phonemic
transcription, and substitution ciphers) as well as orthography. We evaluate
each model on two downstream tasks -- named entity recognition (NER) and
natural language inference (NLI) -- and find that romanization significantly
outperforms other input types in 7 out of 8 evaluation settings, largely
consistent with our hypothesis that it is the most effective approach. We
further analyze how each factor contributed to the success, and suggest that
having longer (subword) tokens shared with pre-trained languages leads to
better utilization of the model.

TL;DR: 提出了DUAL-Bench，首个专注于多模态模型中过度拒绝和安全完成任务的基准测试，评估了18个视觉语言模型在12种危险类别中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能系统解决视觉模态中的过度拒绝问题，模型在双重用途场景中经常失败，需要更细粒度的对齐策略来平衡安全性和实用性。

Method: 构建DUAL-Bench基准测试，评估VLMs在语义保持的视觉扰动下的鲁棒性，重点关注安全完成任务的能力。

Result: 模型表现有显著改进空间：GPT-5-Nano达到12.9%的安全完成率，GPT-5模型平均7.9%，Qwen模型仅3.9%。

Conclusion: DUAL-Bench将促进更细致对齐策略的发展，确保模型在复杂多模态环境中既安全又有用。

Abstract: As vision-language models become increasingly capable, maintaining a balance
between safety and usefulness remains a central challenge. Safety mechanisms,
while essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline
benign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has
systematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting
introduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is
harmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models
frequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or
completing tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained
alignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign
parts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful
elements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal
benchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18
VLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under
semantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room
for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models
average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster
the development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain
both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.

Motivation: 虽然测试时扩展策略在LLM-based解决方案中显示出潜力，但其在真实世界应用中的有效性，特别是与最新推理模型结合使用时，仍不确定。

Method: 在BIRD Mini-Dev基准上对6种轻量级、面向工业的测试时扩展策略和4个LLM（包括2个推理模型）进行基准测试，除了标准准确率指标外，还报告推理延迟和token消耗。

Result: 分治提示和少样本演示持续提升通用和推理型LLM的性能，但引入额外工作流步骤效果不一，基础模型选择至关重要。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了在部署Text2SQL系统时准确率、效率和复杂性之间的实际权衡关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL)
systems, enabling non-expert users to query industrial databases using natural
language. While test-time scaling strategies have shown promise in LLM-based
solutions, their effectiveness in real-world applications, especially with the
latest reasoning models, remains uncertain. In this work, we benchmark six
lightweight, industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs,
including two reasoning models, evaluating their performance on the BIRD
Mini-Dev benchmark. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, we also report inference
latency and token consumption, providing insights relevant for practical system
deployment. Our findings reveal that Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot
demonstrations consistently enhance performance for both general-purpose and
reasoning-focused LLMs. However, introducing additional workflow steps yields
mixed results, and base model selection plays a critical role. This work sheds
light on the practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity
when deploying Text2SQL systems.

Motivation: 基于先前工作LLM x MapReduce-V2，本版本旨在通过模块化分解实现更灵活的研究过程控制，让用户能够更好地定制和干预综述生成过程。

Method: 采用分层模块化架构，将骨架初始化、摘要构建和骨架优化等功能组件实现为独立的MCP服务器。高层规划器根据MCP工具描述和执行历史动态选择模块，通过多轮交互精确捕捉研究视角。

Result: 人类评估表明，该系统在内容深度和长度方面均优于代表性基线方法，突显了基于MCP的模块化规划的优势。

Conclusion: LLM x MapReduce-V3通过分层模块化设计和MCP服务器架构，有效提升了长篇综述生成的质量和可控性，为人机协作的研究过程提供了有力支持。

Abstract: We introduce LLM x MapReduce-V3, a hierarchically modular agent system
designed for long-form survey generation. Building on the prior work, LLM x
MapReduce-V2, this version incorporates a multi-agent architecture where
individual functional components, such as skeleton initialization, digest
construction, and skeleton refinement, are implemented as independent
model-context-protocol (MCP) servers. These atomic servers can be aggregated
into higher-level servers, creating a hierarchically structured system. A
high-level planner agent dynamically orchestrates the workflow by selecting
appropriate modules based on their MCP tool descriptions and the execution
history. This modular decomposition facilitates human-in-the-loop intervention,
affording users greater control and customization over the research process.
Through a multi-turn interaction, the system precisely captures the intended
research perspectives to generate a comprehensive skeleton, which is then
developed into an in-depth survey. Human evaluations demonstrate that our
system surpasses representative baselines in both content depth and length,
highlighting the strength of MCP-based modular planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能够用自然语言表达置信度，但经常表现出过度自信，其原因尚不清楚

Method: 提出ADVICE（答案相关的置信度估计）微调框架，促进基于答案的置信度估计

Result: ADVICE显著改善了置信度校准，同时保持了任务性能，增强了答案相关性

Conclusion: 研究揭示了过度自信的根源，并建立了更可信的置信度表达框架

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled them to express
their confidence in natural language, enhancing transparency and reliability.
However, their confidence often exhibits overconfidence, the cause of which
remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
dynamics underlying verbalized confidence and identify answer-independence as a
key factor, defined as the model's failure to condition confidence on its own
answer. To address this, we propose ADVICE (Answer-Dependent Verbalized
Confidence Estimation), a fine-tuning framework that facilitates
answer-grounded confidence estimation. Extensive experiments show that ADVICE
substantially improves confidence calibration while preserving task
performance. Further analyses confirm that ADVICE strengthens
answer-groundedness, leading to more balanced and well-calibrated confidence
distributions. Our findings shed light on the origin of overconfidence and
establish a framework for more trustworthy confidence verbalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GapDNER模型，通过将上下文间隙作为额外跨度类型，使用网格标注方法解决非连续命名实体识别中的解码模糊问题，在三个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域中，命名实体可能由一系列非相邻标记组成并与其他实体重叠。现有方法通过连接实体片段或内部标记来识别非连续实体，但由于跨度或单词组合的多样性，面临错误传播和解码模糊的挑战。

Method: 提出GapDNER模型，将上下文间隙视为额外跨度类型，将跨度分类转换为标记对网格标注任务。设计两个交互组件：跨度内规律提取模块使用双仿射机制和线性注意力捕获每个跨度的内部规律；跨间关系增强模块使用交叉注意力获取不同跨度间的语义关系。在推理阶段使用BFS算法搜索有效路径。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验结果表明，GapDNER在非连续NER任务中达到了新的最先进性能，并在识别复杂实体结构方面表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: GapDNER通过创新性地对上下文间隙进行表示学习，有效解决了非连续NER中的解码模糊问题，提升了非连续命名实体识别的性能。

Abstract: In biomedical fields, one named entity may consist of a series of
non-adjacent tokens and overlap with other entities. Previous methods recognize
discontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which
face challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide
variety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply
explore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid
tagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our
GapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps
between entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance
discontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an
additional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid
tagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to
comprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span
perspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine
mechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of
each span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes
criss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At
the inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each
entity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all
valid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental
results on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new

advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.

TL;DR: 本文提出评估AI系统对游戏评估能力的新范式，通过100多个新颖棋盘游戏和450多人判断，比较现代语言推理模型与人类在评估游戏公平性和趣味性方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估主要关注问题解决能力，而本文认为评估AI系统对哪些问题值得解决的判断能力同样重要，需要建立评估AI评估能力的新方法。

Method: 引入评估AI评估的形式化方法，利用大规模数据集比较语言模型、推理模型与人类在游戏公平性和趣味性评估上的表现，分析计算复杂度和量化难度两个维度。

Result: 推理模型在游戏评估上比非推理语言模型更接近人类判断，但随着模型接近博弈论最优，与人类数据的拟合度反而下降。评估趣味性时模型表现更不稳定，且推理模型在资源使用上高度可变。

Conclusion: 需要在语言和推理模型中注入更多资源理性的元推理能力，以提高评估的稳定性和可预测性。

Abstract: Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating
which problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how
models play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new
paradigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a
formalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale
dataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare
evaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of
people and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative
queries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These
queries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI
evaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to
quantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to
people in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.
However, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to
game-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more
"jaggedness" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater
difficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning
models show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing
queries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational
meta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.

*Anirudh Ganesh,Jayavardhan Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 成功复现了Ma和Hovy(2016)提出的BiLSTM-CNN-CRF模型，该模型结合字符级CNN表示、词级BiLSTM上下文建模和CRF结构化预测，在NER和POS标注任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证和复现最先进的序列标注神经网络架构，分析其组件有效性，并提供开源实现以促进进一步研究。

Method: 使用BiLSTM-CNN-CRF架构：字符级CNN提取字符表示，BiLSTM建模词级上下文，CRF进行结构化预测，实现端到端训练无需手工特征。

Result: 在CoNLL-2003 NER任务上达到91.18%的F1分数，成功复现了原论文的关键结果，证明了模型在序列标注任务上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功复现了BiLSTM-CNN-CRF模型，验证了其作为序列标注任务强大基准的有效性，开源实现将有助于社区进一步研究。

Abstract: We present a reproducibility study of the state-of-the-art neural
architecture for sequence labeling proposed by Ma and Hovy
(2016)\cite{ma2016end}. The original BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model combines
character-level representations via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
word-level context modeling through Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory
networks (BiLSTMs), and structured prediction using Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs). This end-to-end approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features
while achieving excellent performance on named entity recognition (NER) and
part-of-speech (POS) tagging tasks. Our implementation successfully reproduces
the key results, achieving 91.18\% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER and demonstrating
the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks. We provide a detailed
analysis of the architecture components and release an open-source PyTorch
implementation to facilitate further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个标点符号感知的树库二值化资源与评估套件，通过保留标点符号作为兄弟节点来改进标准二值化流程，显著提升了头部预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的二值化流程在头部选择前会丢弃标点符号，这会改变成分结构并损害头部-子节点识别。

Method: 开发了一个可复现的流程，在二值化前将标点符号保留为兄弟节点，并提供了派生工件、元数据和评估套件。

Result: 在Penn Treebank上，标点符号感知预处理将头部预测准确率从73.66%（Collins规则）和86.66%（MLP）提升到91.85%，并在CCGbank推导对齐方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 所有代码、配置文件和文档均已发布，支持复现并扩展到其他语料库。

Abstract: This article presents a curated resource and evaluation suite for
punctuation-aware treebank binarization. Standard binarization pipelines drop
punctuation before head selection, which alters constituent shape and harms
head-child identification. We release (1) a reproducible pipeline that
preserves punctuation as sibling nodes prior to binarization, (2) derived
artifacts and metadata (intermediate @X markers, reversibility signatures,
alignment indices), and (3) an accompanying evaluation suite covering
head-child prediction, round-trip reversibility, and structural compatibility
with derivational resources (CCGbank). On the Penn Treebank, punctuation-aware
preprocessing improves head prediction accuracy from 73.66\% (Collins rules)
and 86.66\% (MLP) to 91.85\% with the same classifier, and achieves competitive
alignment against CCGbank derivations. All code, configuration files, and
documentation are released to enable replication and extension to other

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了KOTOX：首个同时支持韩语去混淆和去毒化的数据集，针对低资源语言中的隐晦毒性内容问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中毒性内容日益严重，但现有研究主要关注英语，低资源语言代表性不足，LLMs难以识别和中和这些语言中的毒性表达，特别是当用户使用混淆技术逃避检测时。

Method: 基于韩语语言特征分类各种混淆方法，定义基于真实示例的转换规则，构建三个难度级别（简单、普通、困难）的数据集版本。

Result: 创建了首个同时支持韩语去混淆和去毒化的数据集，包含不同混淆难度的三个版本。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于更好地理解和减轻低资源语言LLM中混淆毒性内容的问题，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Toxic content has become an increasingly critical social issue with the rapid
expansion of online communication. While numerous studies explored methods for
detecting and detoxifying such content, most have focused primarily on English,
leaving low-resource language underrepresented. Consequently, Large Language
Models~(LLMs) often struggle to identify and neutralize toxic expressions in
these languages. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when user employ
obfuscation techniques to evade detection systems. Therefore, we propose a
\textbf{KOTOX: Korean Toxic Dataset} for deobfuscation and detoxicification to
address this issue. We categorize various obfuscation approaches based on
linguistic characteristics of Korean and define a set of transformation rules
grounded in real-word examples. Using these rules, we construct three dataset
versions (easy, normal, and hard) representing different levels of obfuscation
difficulty. This is the first dataset that simultaneously supports
deobfuscation and detoxification for the Korean language. We expect it to
facilitate better understanding and mitigating of obfuscated toxic content in
LLM for low-resource languages. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/leeyejin1231/KOTOX.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动化构建虚假前提问题基准的方法，创建了JBA数据集，并开发了增强MLLMs识别虚假前提能力的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在虚假前提问题上存在脆弱性，而现有基准缺乏细粒度分类和足够覆盖范围，无法充分评估模型识别虚假前提的能力。

Method: 开发了完全自动化的流水线来构建虚假前提问题基准，将前提系统分类为3个主要类型和13个子类型，并提出了专门的识别增强框架。

Result: 当前MLLMs在虚假前提识别方面仍然存在困难，但使用所提框架训练的模型在虚假前提识别方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了虚假前提评估基准的空白，提出的增强框架有效提升了MLLMs识别虚假前提的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have witnessed astonishing
advancements in recent years. Despite these successes, MLLMs remain vulnerable
to flase premise problems. However, existing benchmarks targeting this issue
are limited in scope: they often lack fine-grained categorization, exhibit
insufficient coverage, and thus fail to provide a rigorous evaluation of the
ability of models to recognize false premises. To bridge this gap, we introduce
a fully automated pipeline for constructing a comprehensive benchmark of false
premise questions. Our method systematically categorizes the premises into
three main types and thirteen subtypes according to the abilities required to
identify the premises, resulting in the JBA dataset.Results show current MLLMs
still struggle with false premise recognition. Building upon this benchmark, we
further propose a recognition enhancement framework tailored to strengthen the
robustness of MLLMs to detect false premises. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that models trained with our framework achieve significant improvements in
false premise recognition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RV-HATE是一个针对仇恨言论检测的框架，通过强化学习优化多个专门模块的权重，适应不同数据集的特定特征，提高检测准确性并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论在形式和表达上不断演变，不同来源和平台的数据集具有多样性特征，但现有检测方法往往采用固定方法而不适应数据特定特征。

Method: RV-HATE包含多个专门模块，每个模块关注仇恨言论的不同语言或上下文特征，使用强化学习优化模块权重，并通过投票机制聚合模块输出。

Result: 该方法有效处理隐含仇恨言论，相比传统静态方法获得更优越的性能。

Conclusion: RV-HATE通过适应数据集特定特征提高了仇恨言论检测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Hate speech remains prevalent in human society and continues to evolve in its
forms and expressions. Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity
accelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech
datasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed
from different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic
styles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate
speech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to
data-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to
account for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset.
RV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on
distinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework
employs reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the
contribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then
aggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two
primary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the
detection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides
interpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset.
Consequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and
achieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods. Our code
is available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/RV-HATE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了关键令牌微调(CFT)方法，只更新通过反事实扰动识别的功能不可或缺的令牌，在数学推理任务上优于标准监督微调(SFT)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准SFT对所有令牌进行统一惩罚，忽视了只有少量关键令牌决定推理正确性，导致输出多样性减少和泛化能力有限。

Method: CFT方法通过反事实扰动识别关键令牌，只对这些决定性推理步骤进行梯度更新，同时保留非关键令牌的多样性。

Result: 在5个模型、11个数学推理基准测试中，CFT仅微调不到12%的令牌，但始终优于标准SFT，并改善了采样多样性和强化学习初始化。

Conclusion: CFT是一个实用且通用的框架，用于高效和稳健的LLM微调，在保持更高熵的同时维持性能增益。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
as a key method to adapt pre-trained models to domain-specific tasks such as
mathematical reasoning. However, standard SFT uniformly penalizes all tokens,
neglecting that only a small subset of critical tokens determines reasoning
correctness. This uniform supervision often causes reduced output diversity and
limited generalization. We propose Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT), a simple
yet effective approach that updates only tokens identified as functionally
indispensable via counterfactual perturbations. By focusing gradient signals on
these decisive reasoning steps while preserving the diversity of non-critical
tokens, CFT can enhance both generation and diversity. Extensive experiments on
five models across three families (Qwen, OLMo, LLaMA) and eleven mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that CFT, despite fine-tuning on less than 12% of
tokens, consistently outperforms standard SFT. Moreover, CFT enables test-time
scaling through improved sampling diversity and provides a stronger
initialization for reinforcement learning, sustaining performance gains in
later training stages while maintaining higher entropy for better exploration.
These results highlight CFT as a practical and general framework for efficient
and robust LLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了DEEPRESEARCHGUARD框架，通过四阶段保护机制和开放域评估来解决深度研究框架中的安全问题，在提高防御成功率18.16%的同时降低过度拒绝率6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究框架缺乏充分的评估程序和阶段特定保护，通常只关注问答准确率而忽视报告质量的关键方面（可信度、连贯性、广度、深度和安全性），可能导致危险或恶意源被整合到最终报告中。

Method: 引入DEEPRESEARCHGUARD框架，包含四阶段保护机制和开放域评估，使用DRSAFEBENCH作为阶段化安全基准，评估了多种最先进LLM模型。

Result: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD平均防御成功率提高18.16%，过度拒绝率降低6%。输入防护提供最显著的前期保护，计划和研究防护增强了引用纪律和源可信度。

Conclusion: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD能够实现全面的开放域评估和阶段感知防御，有效阻止有害内容传播，同时系统性地提高报告质量而不过度拒绝。

Abstract: Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing
comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses
significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research
cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures
and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match
accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality
such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may
result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final
report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a
comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain
evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple
metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report
dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce
DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation
spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash,
DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success
rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input
guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out
obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline
and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that
DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware
defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while
systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了动态嵌套深度（DND）方法，通过在Transformer层末端选择关键token进行嵌套深度处理，提升LLM性能，同时避免对简单token的冗余计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在处理复杂token时效率不足，需要一种方法能够动态识别并重新处理关键token，以提高模型性能而不显著增加计算开销。

Method: DND在Transformer层末端使用路由器识别关键token，将其反馈进行额外处理。采用路由器控制损失和阈值控制方案来确保选择的准确性和稳定性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，DND使稠密模型Qwen3-1.7B性能提升1.88%，混合专家模型Qwen3-30B-A3B性能提升0.87%，参数和计算开销仅轻微增加。

Conclusion: DND是一种有效的后训练优化方法，能够显著提升预训练LLM的性能，特别适用于处理复杂token，且计算开销可控。

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves
performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in
a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer,
DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an
extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while
avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism
is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling
loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control
scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND
by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a
post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the
performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by
0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.

Motivation: 现有的联合逻辑-数值推理数据集依赖固定规则集，任务复杂度控制有限，限制了其在评估和训练中的泛化能力。

Method: 开发LogiNumSynth合成器，支持细粒度控制推理世界丰富度、逻辑推理深度和数值计算复杂度，实现跨难度级别的灵活数据合成。

Conclusion: LogiNumSynth可作为诊断工具和针对性监督源，用于推进语言模型的集成推理能力。

Abstract: Joint logical-numerical reasoning remains a major challenge for language
models, yet existing datasets rely on fixed rule sets and offer limited control
over task complexity, constraining their generalizability for evaluation and
training. We present LogiNumSynth, a flexible natural language problem
synthesizer that synthesizes tasks requiring proficiency in joint logical
reasoning (e.g., rule-based reasoning) and numerical reasoning (e.g.,
arithmetic computation). LogiNumSynth supports fine-grained control over
reasoning world richness, logical reasoning depth, and the complexity of
numerical computations, enabling flexible data synthesis across difficulty
levels. We demonstrate three key contributions: (1) Synthesizer -- synthesizing
fully controllable joint reasoning tasks over natural language; (2) Evaluation
& Process Analysis -- evaluating both process accuracy and answer accuracy; (3)
Targeted Training -- using synthesized data to enhance LLMs' reasoning
performance. Experiments with multiple LLMs highlight persistent weaknesses in
logical-numerical reasoning, showing that LogiNumSynth can serve as both a
diagnostic tool and a source of targeted supervision for advancing integrated

Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗领域提供临床指导，但直接部署给患者存在安全风险，因为模型缺乏足够的领域专业知识。需要一种更安全的方式来利用LLM的潜力。

Method: 进行两阶段灵感-反馈调查识别临床工作流程中的真实需求；构建包含92,000个问答实例的DoctorFLAN中文医疗数据集，涵盖22个临床任务和27个专科；创建DoctorFLAN-test和DotaBench评估集；对10多个流行LLM进行实验验证。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed healthcare by
offering clinical guidance, yet their direct deployment to patients poses
safety risks due to limited domain expertise. To mitigate this, we propose
repositioning LLMs as clinical assistants that collaborate with experienced
physicians rather than interacting with patients directly. We conduct a
two-stage inspiration-feedback survey to identify real-world needs in clinical
workflows. Guided by this, we construct DoctorFLAN, a large-scale Chinese
medical dataset comprising 92,000 Q&A instances across 22 clinical tasks and 27
specialties. To evaluate model performance in doctor-facing applications, we
introduce DoctorFLAN-test (550 single-turn Q&A items) and DotaBench (74
multi-turn conversations). Experimental results with over ten popular LLMs
demonstrate that DoctorFLAN notably improves the performance of open-source
LLMs in medical contexts, facilitating their alignment with physician workflows
and complementing existing patient-oriented models. This work contributes a
valuable resource and framework for advancing doctor-centered medical LLM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型存在高延迟问题，而现有扩散方法存在信息丢失和过早决策两个核心限制。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段将掩码位置保持为预测标记和掩码嵌入的分布混合；第二阶段逐步确定置信标记，保留不确定标记进行迭代反馈，使用KL散度动态作为收敛标准。

Result: 在编程任务（HumanEval +6.3，MBPP +2.6）和推理任务（GSM8K +2.9，MATH500 +3.8）上准确率提升，同时实现高达10.6倍的加速。

Conclusion: LRD是并行序列生成的一个强大且多功能的替代方案，在保持准确性的同时显著提升速度。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language
generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential
decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream,
mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core
limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized
tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local
decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent
Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a
Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as
distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing
the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage
progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for
iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable
criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding
(HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that
LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a
strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.

TL;DR: CGPO是一种利用置信度信号识别模型推理过程中最大不确定性点，并应用自生成的非人类推理路径指导来减轻轨迹漂移的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化LLM推理的方法倾向于引入对人类推理轨迹的训练偏差，依赖人类或更高能力模型的中间步骤注释限制了探索替代性非人类推理路径，从而约束了可实现的性能。

Method: 提出置信度引导推理路径偏好优化(CGPO)，利用置信度信号识别模型推理过程中的最大不确定性点，并在错误发生前的最低置信点应用自生成的非人类推理路径指导。

Result: 实验表明，在相同训练数据量下，使用小模型生成数据的CGPO方法在大多数情况下比使用强模型生成数据或人工标注的方法表现更好。

Conclusion: CGPO方法通过利用置信度信号在关键不确定性点提供指导，能够有效提升模型推理性能，且不依赖人类或强模型的注释。

Abstract: Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a
training bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference
optimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model
annotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative,
non-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance.
Furthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in
approximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the
lowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its
lowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than
locating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided
Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a
confidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's
reasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path
guidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models
applied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks. The results show that,
with the same amount of training data, our method using data generated by a
small model can achieve better performance in most cases compared with
approaches using data generated by a strong model or human-annotated.

Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in code
generation tasks across various programming languages. However, their outputs
often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks
when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper
introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security
and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and
verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the
Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments
with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often
fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure
code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input
validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential
of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the
trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.

*Jens Van Nooten,Andriy Kosar,Guy De Pauw,Walter Daelemans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于距离的无监督文本分类方法，通过探索句子编码器在语义相似性计算中的表现，提出了一种新颖的标签特定阈值优化方法，显著提升了多标签文本分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于距离的文本分类方法具有快速推理和适应扩展标签集的优势，但在多标签分类中需要确定相似性阈值。现有方法对阈值选择研究不足，特别是在不同模型、数据集和标签集下语义关系的变化尚未充分探索。

Method: 首先通过探索性研究验证文本和标签间语义关系在不同模型、数据集和标签集间的变化，然后提出使用验证集优化标签特定阈值的新方法。

Result: 相似性分布在模型、数据集和标签集间存在显著差异。提出的标签特定阈值方法相比标准化0.5阈值平均提升46%，比先前工作的统一阈值方法平均提升14%，且在有限标注样本下仍表现良好。

Conclusion: 基于距离的无监督文本分类中，标签特定阈值优化是有效的策略，能够显著提升分类性能，特别是在多标签分类场景下。

Abstract: Distance-based unsupervised text classification is a method within text
classification that leverages the semantic similarity between a label and a
text to determine label relevance. This method provides numerous benefits,
including fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed
to zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training
in such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information
retrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text
instance is "similar" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label
is determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art
sentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text
instance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary
classification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon
previous literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and
evaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based
classification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the
semantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,
and label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic
multi-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity
distributions show statistically significant differences across models,
datasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing
label-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific
thresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5
thresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work
by an average of 14%. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong performance
even with limited labeled examples.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究构建了针对欧洲西班牙语的仇恨言论数据集元集合，并将其扩展到欧洲葡萄牙语和两种加利西亚语变体，建立了伊比利亚语言仇恨言论检测的新基准，并评估了大语言模型在不同设置下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论对社会和个人构成严重威胁，但现有研究主要集中于英语，缺乏对低资源语言及其语言变体的关注。大语言模型需要大量数据，而低资源语言往往无法满足这一需求。

Method: 通过系统分析和整合现有资源，构建了标准化的欧洲西班牙语仇恨言论数据集元集合，并将其翻译扩展到欧洲葡萄牙语和两种加利西亚语变体，创建对齐的多语言语料库。

Result: 建立了伊比利亚语言仇恨言论检测的新基准，评估了大语言模型在零样本、少样本和微调设置下的性能，提供了跨语言分析结果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多语言和变体感知方法在仇恨言论检测中的重要性，为代表性不足的欧洲语言提供了改进基准的基础。

Abstract: Hate speech poses a serious threat to social cohesion and individual
well-being, particularly on social media, where it spreads rapidly. While
research on hate speech detection has progressed, it remains largely focused on
English, resulting in limited resources and benchmarks for low-resource
languages. Moreover, many of these languages have multiple linguistic
varieties, a factor often overlooked in current approaches. At the same time,
large language models require substantial amounts of data to perform reliably,
a requirement that low-resource languages often cannot meet. In this work, we
address these gaps by compiling a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for
European Spanish, standardised with unified labels and metadata. This
collection is based on a systematic analysis and integration of existing
resources, aiming to bridge the data gap and support more consistent and
scalable hate speech detection. We extended this collection by translating it
into European Portuguese and into a Galician standard that is more convergent
with Spanish and another Galician variant that is more convergent with
Portuguese, creating aligned multilingual corpora. Using these resources, we
establish new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages. We
evaluate state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuning settings, providing baseline results for future research. Moreover,
we perform a cross-lingual analysis with our target languages. Our findings
underscore the importance of multilingual and variety-aware approaches in hate
speech detection and offer a foundation for improved benchmarking in
underrepresented European languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个临床基础的评估框架，用于评估胸部X光视觉问答中思维链解释的忠实度，发现答案准确性与解释质量脱节，专有模型在归因和保真度方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型产生的思维链解释往往听起来合理但未能反映真实决策过程，这在临床高风险应用中会削弱信任，而现有评估很少发现这种不一致。

Method: 通过控制文本和图像修改在三个维度上探测思维链忠实度：临床保真度、因果归因和置信度校准，并进行了读者研究（n=4）和六个视觉语言模型的基准测试。

Result: 评估者与放射科医生的相关性在所有维度上都落在观察到的放射科医生间差异范围内，专有模型在归因（25.0% vs 1.4%）和保真度（36.1% vs 31.7%）方面表现优于开源模型，文本线索比视觉线索更能改变解释。

Conclusion: 答案准确性和解释质量是脱节的，承认注入的线索不能确保基础性，需要超越最终答案准确性来评估模型，特别是在临床部署中。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT)
explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision
process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations
rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to
formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual
question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and
image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution,
and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist
correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes,
with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate
alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone
($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows
that answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging
injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more
than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy,
proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on
fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to
evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse
understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as
discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike
simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning.
To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under
Discourse Relation (CuDR), where a model completes a discourse given a
specified relation. To support this task, we construct a corpus of minimal
contrastive pairs tailored for activation patching in circuit discovery.
Experiments show that sparse circuits ($\approx 0.2\%$ of a full GPT-2 model)
recover discourse understanding in the English PDTB-based CuDR task. These
circuits generalize well to unseen discourse frameworks such as RST and SDRT.
Further analysis shows lower layers capture linguistic features such as lexical
semantics and coreference, while upper layers encode discourse-level
abstractions. Feature utility is consistent across frameworks (e.g.,
coreference supports Expansion-like relations).

TL;DR: RAGen是一个可扩展的模块化框架，用于生成领域特定的问答上下文三元组，以支持检索增强生成(RAG)系统的领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效适应RAG系统到特定领域需要专门的、上下文丰富的训练数据，而不仅仅是通用问答数据。

Method: 通过识别文档中的关键概念，基于布鲁姆分类学原则生成多样化问题，并从相关上下文中提取精确答案来生成问答上下文三元组。支持多种RAG适应策略，包括语义分块、层次概念提取和多块检索。

Result: RAGen能够高效处理大规模和不断演化的文档语料库，无需冗余处理，特别适合动态演化的领域。

Conclusion: RAGen为RAG系统的领域适应提供了一个可扩展且模块化的解决方案，特别适用于科学研究和企业知识库等动态领域。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and
reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to
enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to
domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data
beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable
and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context
(QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces
these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse
questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with
precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG
adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the
LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features
semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval,
along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust
reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and
evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially
suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and
enterprise knowledge bases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现LLMs在简单问答和复杂查询中对同一事实的回答存在系统性不一致，提出了SLAQ评估框架来量化这种不一致性，并揭示了位置依赖的准确性损失和动量效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在简单事实问答中表现准确，但在复杂查询中回答同一事实时出现不一致，这种可靠性差距影响了模型的可信度。

Method: 提出SLAQ评估框架，比较LLMs对同一事实在简单查询和复杂查询中的回答一致性，分析了16个LLM在600个查询上的表现。

Result: 发现短长查询回答存在系统性不一致，存在位置依赖的准确性损失和动量效应，机制分析显示对齐事实激活重叠的模型内部结构。

Conclusion: 事实一致性是LLMs可信度的重要方面，当前评估实践假设简单查询性能好意味着复杂任务可靠性的做法存在问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?"
yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing
a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task
complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual
question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex
queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,
we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a
controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual
questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex
queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic
misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further
uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive
correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through
mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model
internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict
short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes
factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'
trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly
assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in
more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebRouter是一个基于信息论的查询特定路由器，通过成本感知的变分信息瓶颈目标，在压缩输入提示的同时显式惩罚预期操作成本，显著降低LLM驱动的Web代理的运营成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的Web代理面临成本与性能的关键权衡，复杂的提示（包含目标、行动历史和状态）导致LLM集成性能下降，需要解决这一成本效益挑战。

Method: 提出WebRouter，采用成本感知的变分信息瓶颈（ca-VIB）目标，学习输入提示的压缩表示，同时显式惩罚预期操作成本。

Result: 在WebVoyager基准的五个真实网站上的实验表明，与GPT-4o基线相比，WebRouter将运营成本降低了87.8%，而准确率仅下降3.8%。

Conclusion: WebRouter通过信息论方法有效解决了LLM驱动的Web代理的成本性能权衡问题，实现了显著的成本节约和可接受的性能损失。

Abstract: LLM-brained web agents offer powerful capabilities for web automation but
face a critical cost-performance trade-off. The challenge is amplified by web
agents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and
environmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address
this, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an
information-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware
Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a
compressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the
expected operational cost. Experiments on five real-world websites from the
WebVoyager benchmark show that WebRouter reduces operational costs by a
striking 87.8\% compared to a GPT-4o baseline, while incurring only a 3.8\%
accuracy drop.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了BERT和DistilBERT在道德情感分类中的跨领域公平性问题，发现聚合性能会掩盖公平性差异，并提出了道德公平一致性(MFC)指标来量化跨领域稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保自然语言处理中道德情感分类的公平性具有挑战性，特别是在跨领域转移的情况下，其中Transformer模型被广泛部署。

Method: 使用道德基础Twitter语料库(MFTC)和道德基础Reddit语料库(MFRC)，在领域内和跨领域协议下评估BERT和DistilBERT的多标签分类性能。

Result: 观察到显著的跨领域不对称性：Twitter->Reddit转移使micro-F1下降14.9%，而Reddit->Twitter仅下降1.5%。权威标签表现出0.22-0.23的人口统计均等差异和0.40-0.41的均等机会差异。MFC与人口统计均等差异呈完美负相关(rho = -1.000, p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: MFC作为补充性、诊断导向的指标，能够对道德推理模型进行公平性感知评估，实现跨异构语言环境的更可靠部署。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in natural language processing for moral sentiment
classification is challenging, particularly under cross-domain shifts where
transformer models are increasingly deployed. Using the Moral Foundations
Twitter Corpus (MFTC) and Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC), this work
evaluates BERT and DistilBERT in a multi-label setting with in-domain and
cross-domain protocols. Aggregate performance can mask disparities: we observe
pronounced asymmetry in transfer, with Twitter->Reddit degrading micro-F1 by
14.9% versus only 1.5% for Reddit->Twitter. Per-label analysis reveals fairness
violations hidden by overall scores; notably, the authority label exhibits
Demographic Parity Differences of 0.22-0.23 and Equalized Odds Differences of
0.40-0.41. To address this gap, we introduce the Moral Fairness Consistency
(MFC) metric, which quantifies the cross-domain stability of moral foundation
detection. MFC shows strong empirical validity, achieving a perfect negative
correlation with Demographic Parity Difference (rho = -1.000, p < 0.001) while
remaining independent of standard performance metrics. Across labels, loyalty
demonstrates the highest consistency (MFC = 0.96) and authority the lowest (MFC
= 0.78). These findings establish MFC as a complementary, diagnosis-oriented
metric for fairness-aware evaluation of moral reasoning models, enabling more
reliable deployment across heterogeneous linguistic contexts. .

TL;DR: 该论文重新评估语义解析器评估方法，将图匹配与自动定理证明相结合，发现基于图匹配的评估指标无法准确反映逻辑等价性，并提出了逻辑敏感评估和简化目标表示的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图匹配的评估指标（如Smatch）只关注表面重叠而非逻辑等价性，这限制了语义解析器在推理导向应用中的评估准确性。

Method: 比较监督微调（T5-Small/Base）和少样本上下文学习（GPT-4o/4.1/5）两种解析器构建方法，使用图匹配、双向蕴含验证和格式良好性进行多维度评估。

Result: 在图匹配上表现良好的模型往往无法产生逻辑等价的公式。归一化减少了目标变异性，提高了格式良好性和逻辑充分性。错误分析显示性能随公式复杂度增加而下降，主要失败涉及变量绑定、索引和谓词命名。

Conclusion: 基于图的评估指标在推理导向应用中存在局限性，需要逻辑敏感的评估和训练目标，以及简化、归一化的目标表示。

Abstract: Graph-matching metrics such as Smatch are the de facto standard for
evaluating neural semantic parsers, yet they capture surface overlap rather
than logical equivalence. We reassess evaluation by pairing graph-matching with
automated theorem proving. We compare two approaches to building parsers:
supervised fine-tuning (T5-Small/Base) and few-shot in-context learning
(GPT-4o/4.1/5), under normalized and unnormalized targets. We evaluate outputs
using graph-matching, bidirectional entailment between source and target
formulas with a first-order logic theorem prover, and well-formedness. Across
settings, we find that models performing well on graph-matching often fail to
produce logically equivalent formulas. Normalization reduces incidental target
variability, improves well-formedness, and strengthens logical adequacy. Error
analysis shows performance degrades with increasing formula complexity and with
coordination, prepositional phrases, and passive voice; the dominant failures
involve variable binding and indexing, and predicate naming. These findings
highlight limits of graph-based metrics for reasoning-oriented applications and
motivate logic-sensitive evaluation and training objectives together with
simplified, normalized target representations. All code and data for our
experiments are publicly available.

TL;DR: XQuant是一个无需训练、即插即用的框架，通过数据无关校准和跨层KV缓存压缩，实现超低比特宽度（低于1.4位）的KV缓存量化，在保持模型精度的同时显著减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长文本时KV缓存内存需求巨大，在资源受限环境中部署面临挑战，需要有效的量化方法来减少内存消耗。

Method: 提出XQuant框架，包含计算量可忽略的数据无关校准方法和跨层KV缓存压缩技术，实现超低比特宽度的KV缓存量化。

Result: 在TruthfulQA和LongBench上的实验表明，XQuant优于现有最先进方法（如KIVI-2bit和AsymKV-1.5bit），在更低比特宽度下仍保持优越性能。

Conclusion: XQuant在内存效率和模型精度之间建立了更好的平衡，为资源受限环境中的LLM部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks. However, their extensive memory
requirements, particularly due to KV cache growth during long-text
understanding and generation, present significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Quantization has emerged as a promising
solution to reduce memory consumption while preserving historical information.
We propose XQuant, a training-free and plug-and-play framework that achieves
ultra-low equivalent bit-width KV cache quantization. XQuant introduces two key
innovations: a computationally negligible data-free calibration method and
cross-layer KV cache compression, enabling quantization to sub-1.4 bits.
Extensive experiments on TruthfulQA and LongBench demonstrate that XQuant
outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., KIVI-2bit and AsymKV-1.5bit) by
achieving lower bit-width while maintaining superior performance, establishing
a better trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制主要关注检测隐藏指令，但对基于内容操纵的攻击无效。AI代理在检索外部文档时需要能够批判性评估信息，以保护自身和用户免受内容攻击。

Method: 提出将自动事实核查任务重新用作AI代理的认知自卫工具，通过外部证据验证声明并评估来源可信度。

Result: 论证了仅检测隐藏指令的防御机制不足以应对内容攻击，需要更全面的信息评估方法。

Conclusion: AI代理必须发展批判性评估能力，将自动事实核查作为认知自卫工具，以有效防御内容攻击。

Abstract: When AI agents retrieve and reason over external documents, adversaries can
manipulate the data they receive to subvert their behaviour. Previous research
has studied indirect prompt injection, where the attacker injects malicious
instructions. We argue that injection of instructions is not necessary to
manipulate agents - attackers could instead supply biased, misleading, or false
information. We term this an attack by content. Existing defenses, which focus
on detecting hidden commands, are ineffective against attacks by content. To
defend themselves and their users, agents must critically evaluate retrieved
information, corroborating claims with external evidence and evaluating source
trustworthiness. We argue that this is analogous to an existing NLP task,
automated fact-checking, which we propose to repurpose as a cognitive
self-defense tool for agents.

Motivation: 心理测量测试越来越多地用于评估大型语言模型的心理结构，但尚不清楚这些为人类设计的测试是否能对LLMs产生有意义的结果。

Method: 系统评估三种心理结构（性别歧视、种族歧视和道德）的人类心理测量测试的可靠性和有效性，包括收敛效度和生态效度评估。

Result: 测试在多个项目和提示变体中显示出中等可靠性，但测试分数与下游任务行为不一致，有时甚至呈负相关，表明生态效度低。

Conclusion: 在解释心理测量测试分数之前必须进行系统评估，为人类设计的测试不能直接应用于LLMs而需要调整。

Abstract: Psychometric tests are increasingly used to assess psychological constructs
in large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear whether these
tests -- originally developed for humans -- yield meaningful results when
applied to LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the reliability and
validity of human psychometric tests for three constructs: sexism, racism, and
morality. We find moderate reliability across multiple item and prompt
variations. Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing
theory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing
the alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream
tasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in
some cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks,
indicating low ecological validity. Our results highlight that systematic
evaluations of psychometric tests is essential before interpreting their
scores. They also suggest that psychometric tests designed for humans cannot be
applied directly to LLMs without adaptation.

Conclusion: EASE通过评估感知的决策机制有效解决了证据稀缺下的假新闻检测问题，在实时场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,
where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing
approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to
generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose
Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time
fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process
according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a
sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)
Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into
decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)
Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large
language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is
adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates
sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the
accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo
labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge
through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the
evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable
evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.
Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news
for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves
generalization to real-time news. The code and dataset are available:

TL;DR: 研究发现，在上下文学习(ICL)中也会出现新兴错位(EM)现象，即窄领域上下文示例会导致大语言模型产生广泛错位的回答，错误率在2%-58%之间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究显示窄领域微调会导致模型错位，但未考察上下文学习是否也会产生类似问题。

Method: 使用三个前沿模型和三个数据集，通过提供64-256个窄领域上下文示例，并分析逐步推理过程。

Result: 模型在窄领域上下文示例下产生错位回答的比例为2%-17%(64示例)和最高58%(256示例)，67.5%的错位推理轨迹显示模型采用了危险"角色"来合理化有害输出。

Conclusion: 上下文学习同样会导致新兴错位现象，其机制与微调诱导的错位相似，模型会通过采纳危险角色来合理化有害行为。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned
LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these
findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out
in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find
that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly
misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context
examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by
eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged).
Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of
misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless
or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法主要关注实体关系提取，局限于句子级上下文或预定义模式，难以构建高质量、语义丰富的知识图谱

Method: 使用分层提取框架，在多个层次组织信息，利用最先进的LLM提取和构建知识图谱

Result: 从结构和语义角度全面评估了构建的知识图谱，揭示了当前LLM在KG构建中的优势和不足

Conclusion: 识别了未来研究的关键挑战，并发布了儿童心理健康领域的LLM生成KG数据集，以促进高风险领域更透明可靠的应用

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for knowledge-intensive tasks and have shown
promise in reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However,
constructing high-quality KGs remains difficult, requiring accurate information
extraction and structured representations that support interpretability and
downstream utility. Existing LLM-based approaches often focus narrowly on
entity and relation extraction, limiting coverage to sentence-level contexts or
relying on predefined schemas. We propose a hierarchical extraction framework
that organizes information at multiple levels, enabling the creation of
semantically rich and well-structured KGs. Using state-of-the-art LLMs, we
extract and construct knowledge graphs and evaluate them comprehensively from
both structural and semantic perspectives. Our results highlight the strengths
and shortcomings of current LLMs in KG construction and identify key challenges
for future work. To advance research in this area, we also release a curated
dataset of LLM-generated KGs derived from research papers on children's mental
well-being. This resource aims to foster more transparent, reliable, and
impactful applications in high-stakes domains such as healthcare.

*Sabrina McCallum,Amit Parekh,Alessandro Suglia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用语言反馈来从最优和次优演示中学习鲁棒表示的方法，通过将语言反馈嵌入作为Transformer策略的输入，并辅以反馈预测的辅助学习目标，显著提升了智能体的组合泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的具身AI方法通常从专家演示中学习策略，但缺乏评估演示动作质量的机制，要么只能学习最优行为，要么可能复制错误和低效行为。强化学习虽然提供了替代方案，但其探索过程通常牺牲数据效率。

Method: 将语言反馈嵌入直接作为Transformer策略输入序列的一部分，并可选地通过辅助自监督学习目标（反馈预测）来补充传统的下一动作预测目标。在自定义的BabyAI-XGen环境中测试了该方法。

Result: 在具身视觉与语言任务上，该方法显著提高了智能体的组合泛化能力和鲁棒性，表明这种数据高效的方法能够成功将次优行为转化为学习机会。

Conclusion: 语言反馈是语言指定具身任务中中间标量奖励的竞争性和直观替代方案，能够有效提升学习效果。

Abstract: Current approaches to embodied AI tend to learn policies from expert
demonstrations. However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of
demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or
they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning
offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in
sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with
imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and
suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback
as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide
language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a
Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action
prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for
feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied
Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show
significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and
robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to
successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall,
our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive
alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智力障碍人士理解复杂文本的困难，现有文本到图像模型过于注重美学而忽视可访问性，需要探索视觉插图与文本简化之间的关系。

Method: 设计了五种提示模板（基础对象焦点、上下文场景、教育布局、多级细节、网格布局），使用400个来自四个TS数据集的句子级简化文本，进行两阶段评估：CLIPScore评估和专家人工标注。

Result: 基础对象焦点提示模板实现了最高的语义对齐，复古风格被认为最可访问，Wikipedia是最有效的数据源，文本简单性维度显示出强可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架为可访问内容生成提供了实用指南，强调了结构化提示在AI生成视觉可访问性工具中的重要性，视觉极简主义能够增强语言可访问性。

Abstract: Individuals with intellectual disabilities often have difficulties in
comprehending complex texts. While many text-to-image models prioritize
aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate
to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a
structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating
accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates,
i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level
Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while
adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial
separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications
from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and
ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template
effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of
generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts.
Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest
semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language
accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most
accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator
agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong
reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework
offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores
the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility
tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型对情感智能需求的增长，需要理解情感表达的内部机制并控制生成文本中的情感。

Method: 构建SEV数据集提取上下文无关的情感方向，通过分析分解和因果分析识别神经元和注意力头，量化各子层对情感表示的因果影响，整合局部组件形成全局情感电路。

Result: 识别出情感电路，直接调控这些电路在测试集上达到99.65%的情感表达准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统发现和验证大语言模型中情感电路的研究，为可解释性和可控情感智能提供了新见解。

Abstract: As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs)
grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give
rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text.
This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic
mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms
take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first
construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit
comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract
context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context
encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally
implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal
analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement
interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the
model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local
components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional
expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65%
emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and
steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights
into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了LLM特定效用的概念，发现人类标注的段落对特定LLM并非最优，且不同LLM之间的效用段落不可转移，强调在RAG研究中采用LLM特定效用的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索关注相关性，但RAG的有效性取决于检索段落的效用。现有研究将效用视为通用属性，忽略了不同LLM由于内部知识和理解能力差异，可能从同一段落中获益不同。

Method: 通过跨多个数据集和LLM的大规模实验，分析LLM特定效用；提出基于困惑度的LLM特定效用评估基准程序；评估现有效用判断方法在六个数据集上的表现。

Result: 人类标注的段落对特定LLM并非最优；真实效用段落在不同LLM间不可转移；基于伪答案的言语化方法表现稳健，但LLM在评估效用方面存在困难。

Conclusion: RAG研究必须考虑LLM特定效用，现有LLM在效用评估方面存在局限性，需要开发更有效的LLM特定效用判断方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on
relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,
i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and
comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic
attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from
the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension
ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion
of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple
datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal
for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across
different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the
LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some
human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific
LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for
LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,
we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We
evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while
verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to
assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and
to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.

TL;DR: 提出了Rollout Routing Replay (R3)方法，通过记录推理阶段的路由分布并在训练时重放，解决MoE模型在强化学习训练中的路由不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在强化学习训练中路由机制会引入不稳定性，甚至导致灾难性训练崩溃。研究发现训练和推理阶段存在路由行为不一致的问题。

Method: 提出R3方法：记录推理引擎的路由分布，在训练时重放这些分布，减少训练-推理策略KL散度，缓解极端差异。

Result: R3成功稳定了RL训练，防止了崩溃，在多种设置下的实验表明其性能优于GSPO和TIS等方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为稳定MoE模型中的强化学习训练提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing
the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to
catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference
consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing
behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions,
the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated
forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout
Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the
inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces
training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies
without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings
confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and
outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a
new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型在微调过程中的记忆问题，发现记忆现象在训练早期急剧增加，并提出了基于n-gram的早期停止准则和损失正则化方法来缓解记忆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在许多任务上表现出色，但它们会记忆训练数据，从而暴露私有或受版权保护的文本。大多数防御措施针对预训练阶段，而对微调过程中的记忆问题，特别是领域适应和指令微调中的记忆问题了解不足。

Method: 在Pythia、Llama3和Mistral模型上微调，跟踪训练过程中的逐字记忆。使用简单的n-gram记忆评分作为早期停止准则，并引入n-gram感知的损失正则化器。

Result: 发现记忆在前几个训练周期中急剧增加，通常显著早于验证困惑度或评估性能的优化。提出的n-gram记忆评分可靠地预测逐字记忆，早期停止准则能有效缓解记忆问题且性能损失最小。损失正则化器在所有测试模型系列中减少记忆达40%，与现有记忆缓解策略相比最小化性能权衡。

Conclusion: 这些结果为语言模型微调过程中的记忆动态提供了实用、可扩展的见解，提出的方法能有效缓解记忆问题。

Abstract: Although large language models excel across many tasks, they can memorise
training data and thereby expose private or copyrighted text. Most defences
target the pre-training stage, leaving memorisation during fine-tuning,
especially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning, poorly understood. We
fine-tune Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models spanning 1.4B-70B parameters on
common evaluation datasets and track verbatim memorisation throughout training.
We find that memorisation increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often
significantly before either validation perplexity or evaluation performance is
optimised. We use a simple but effective n-gram memorisation score which
reliably precedes verbatim memorisation; using it as an early-stopping
criterion mitigates memorisation with minimal performance loss. Further, we
introduce an n-gram-aware loss regulariser and show that it reduces
memorisation across all model families tested by up to 40% while minimising
evaluation performance trade-offs when compared to an existing memorisation
mitigation strategy. These results yield practical, scalable insights into
memorisation dynamics during language model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的社交推理游戏研究大多简化为LLM自对弈，产生模板化对话并忽视社交游戏的丰富性，且缺乏质量参考数据和细粒度评估方法。

Method: 构建包含100+小时视频、32.4M话语标记和15种规则变体的高质量数据集，并提出两阶段策略对齐评估：言语评估（多选择任务评估社交能力）和决策评估（评估投票选择和对手角色推理）。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLMs表现多样，约一半模型得分低于0.50，在欺骗和反事实推理方面存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 该数据集和评估框架为多智能体交互中的语言、推理和策略研究提供了新的基准和启发。

Abstract: Social deduction games like Werewolf combine language, reasoning, and
strategy, providing a testbed for studying natural language and social
intelligence. However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play,
yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of
social gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival
time or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To
address these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal
Werewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens,
and 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel
strategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies
as ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as
multiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate
stances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation,
which assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This
framework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning
capabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent
gameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse
performance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in
deception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires
research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的LLM在超过五分之一的情况下会错误判断自身能力，导致基于这种内部不确定性的响应无法完全信任，这阻碍了可靠AI的发展。

Method: 结合两个组件：(i)自省：模型生成并分类其判断为可行或不可行的任务；(ii)共识奖励：通过内部一致性来强化自我知识评估的稳定性。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B上的实验显示，KnowRL显著提升了自我认知能力，准确率提高高达28%，F1分数提高12%，仅需少量种子集且无需外部监督。

Conclusion: 该框架解锁了LLM自我提升知识意识的潜力，为实现更可靠、更负责任的AI以及在关键应用中更安全的部署打开了大门。

Abstract: Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands
the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research
shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in
five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to
fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques
that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL
that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility
boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework
combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and
classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based
rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through
internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens
consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.
In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved
self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic
benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external
supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,
outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially
unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge
awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer
deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence
from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process
to all future models.

Motivation: 传统调查成本高且耗时，虽然LLMs被提议作为可扩展的替代方案，但其输出存在偏差且估计无效。研究旨在探索如何最佳分配人类响应在合成和去偏方法之间。

Method: 使用两个包含营养、政治和经济问题的面板调查，研究合成方法（用LLM生成响应）和去偏方法（校正人口估计偏差）的相互作用，以及人类响应的最佳分配策略。

Result: 单独使用合成方法会产生显著偏差（24-86%），而结合去偏方法可将偏差降至5%以下，并将有效样本量提高达14%。在固定预算下，将大部分人类响应分配给去偏处理比用于微调效果更好。

Conclusion: 挑战了将所有人类响应用于微调的常见做法，证明在固定预算下，将大部分响应分配给去偏处理能实现更有效的估计。

Abstract: Surveys provide valuable insights into public opinion and behavior, but their
execution is costly and slow. Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed
as a scalable, low-cost substitute for human respondents, but their outputs are
often biased and yield invalid estimates. We study the interplay between
synthesis methods that use LLMs to generate survey responses and rectification
methods that debias population estimates, and explore how human responses are
best allocated between them. Using two panel surveys with questions on
nutrition, politics, and economics, we find that synthesis alone introduces
substantial bias (24-86%), whereas combining it with rectification reduces bias
below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%. Overall, we
challenge the common practice of using all human responses for fine-tuning,
showing that under a fixed budget, allocating most to rectification results in
far more effective estimation.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have become central to everyday life,
producing human-like text across diverse domains. A growing body of research
investigates whether these models also exhibit personality- and
demographic-like characteristics in their language. In this work, we introduce
a novel, data-driven methodology for assessing LLM personality without relying
on self-report questionnaires, applying instead automatic personality and
gender classifiers to model replies on open-ended questions collected from
Reddit. Comparing six widely used models to human-authored responses, we find
that LLMs systematically express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism,
reflecting cooperative and stable conversational tendencies. Gendered language
patterns in model text broadly resemble those of human writers, though with
reduced variation, echoing prior findings on automated agents. We contribute a
new dataset of human and model responses, along with large-scale comparative
analyses, shedding new light on the topic of personality and demographic
patterns of generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中实体类别持续增加，传统NER无法适应，现有持续学习方法面临灾难性遗忘和非实体类型语义偏移的挑战。

Method: 将CNER任务转换为持续实体三元组序列生成问题，使用预训练seq2seq模型，设计类型特定置信度伪标签策略和知识蒸馏来缓解标签噪声影响。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多个CNER设置中优于先前最先进方法，与非持续学习结果的差距最小。

Conclusion: GenCNER是一个简单有效的生成式框架，成功解决了持续命名实体识别中的关键挑战，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Traditional named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify text mentions
into pre-defined entity types. Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is
introduced since entity categories are continuously increasing in various
real-world scenarios. However, existing continual learning (CL) methods for NER
face challenges of catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift of non-entity
type. In this paper, we propose GenCNER, a simple but effective Generative
framework for CNER to mitigate the above drawbacks. Specifically, we skillfully
convert the CNER task into sustained entity triplet sequence generation problem
and utilize a powerful pre-trained seq2seq model to solve it. Additionally, we
design a type-specific confidence-based pseudo labeling strategy along with
knowledge distillation (KD) to preserve learned knowledge and alleviate the
impact of label noise at the triplet level. Experimental results on two
benchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in multiple CNER settings, and achieves the smallest
gap compared with non-CL results.

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能够有效执行文本预处理任务，在考虑上下文的同时提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Text preprocessing is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing,
involving techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to
prepare text as input for further processing and analysis. Despite the
context-dependent nature of the above techniques, traditional methods usually
ignore contextual information. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various preprocessing tasks, due to
their ability to take context into account without requiring extensive
language-specific annotated resources. Through a comprehensive evaluation on
web-sourced data, we compare LLM-based preprocessing (specifically stopword
removal, lemmatization and stemming) to traditional algorithms across multiple
text classification tasks in six European languages. Our analysis indicates
that LLMs are capable of replicating traditional stopword removal,
lemmatization, and stemming methods with accuracies reaching 97%, 82%, and 74%,
respectively. Additionally, we show that ML algorithms trained on texts
preprocessed by LLMs achieve an improvement of up to 6% with respect to the
$F_1$ measure compared to traditional techniques. Our code, prompts, and

*Yusheng Song,Lirong Qiu,Xi Zhang,Zhihao Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出统一框架解决LLM幻觉检测的两难困境：内部状态探测和思维链验证各有盲区，通过多路径推理机制和分段感知时序交叉注意力模块实现有效融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM幻觉检测中的"检测困境"：内部状态探测擅长识别事实不一致但在逻辑谬误上失败，而思维链验证则相反，这导致任务依赖的盲点。

Method: 引入多路径推理机制获取更可比较的细粒度信号，以及分段感知时序交叉注意力模块自适应融合对齐后的表示，精确定位细微的不一致。

Result: 在三个多样化基准测试和两个领先LLM上的广泛实验表明，该框架持续且显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架成功解决了LLM幻觉检测中的关键挑战，通过克服信号稀缺和表示对齐障碍，实现了更全面的幻觉检测能力。

Abstract: The detection of sophisticated hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs)
is hampered by a ``Detection Dilemma'': methods probing internal states
(Internal State Probing) excel at identifying factual inconsistencies but fail
on logical fallacies, while those verifying externalized reasoning
(Chain-of-Thought Verification) show the opposite behavior. This schism creates
a task-dependent blind spot: Chain-of-Thought Verification fails on
fact-intensive tasks like open-domain QA where reasoning is ungrounded, while
Internal State Probing is ineffective on logic-intensive tasks like
mathematical reasoning where models are confidently wrong. We resolve this with
a unified framework that bridges this critical gap. However, unification is
hindered by two fundamental challenges: the Signal Scarcity Barrier, as coarse
symbolic reasoning chains lack signals directly comparable to fine-grained
internal states, and the Representational Alignment Barrier, a deep-seated
mismatch between their underlying semantic spaces. To overcome these, we
introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism to obtain more comparable,
fine-grained signals, and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module
to adaptively fuse these now-aligned representations, pinpointing subtle
dissonances. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading
LLMs demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms
strong baselines. Our code is available: https://github.com/peach918/HalluDet.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TextGraphFuseGAT架构，结合预训练Transformer编码器(PhoBERT)和图注意力网络，用于越南语标记级分类任务，在多个基准数据集上表现优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统序列模型可能无法充分捕捉标记间的复杂依赖关系，需要结合图神经网络来建模超越序列上下文的丰富标记间关系。

Method: 构建基于PhoBERT标记嵌入的完全连接图，使用GAT层捕获标记间依赖，再应用Transformer式自注意力层增强上下文表示，最后通过分类头进行序列标注。

Result: 在三个越南语基准数据集(PhoNER-COVID19、PhoDisfluency、VietMed-NER)上均优于基线模型，包括仅使用Transformer的模型和BiLSTM+CNN+CRF混合模型。

Conclusion: 将预训练语义特征与基于图的关系建模相结合，能有效提升跨多个领域的标记分类性能，证明了图注意力网络在捕获复杂标记依赖方面的有效性。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural architecture named TextGraphFuseGAT, which
integrates a pretrained transformer encoder (PhoBERT) with Graph Attention
Networks for token-level classification tasks. The proposed model constructs a
fully connected graph over the token embeddings produced by PhoBERT, enabling
the GAT layer to capture rich inter-token dependencies beyond those modeled by
sequential context alone. To further enhance contextualization, a
Transformer-style self-attention layer is applied on top of the graph-enhanced
embeddings. The final token representations are passed through a classification
head to perform sequence labeling. We evaluate our approach on three Vietnamese
benchmark datasets: PhoNER-COVID19 for named entity recognition in the COVID-19
domain, PhoDisfluency for speech disfluency detection, and VietMed-NER for
medical-domain NER. VietMed-NER is the first Vietnamese medical spoken NER
dataset, featuring 18 entity types collected from real-world medical speech
transcripts and annotated with the BIO tagging scheme. Its specialized
vocabulary and domain-specific expressions make it a challenging benchmark for
token-level classification models. Experimental results show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines, including transformer-only and
hybrid neural models such as BiLSTM + CNN + CRF, confirming the effectiveness
of combining pretrained semantic features with graph-based relational modeling
for improved token classification across multiple domains.

### [143] [Information-Preserving Reformulation of Reasoning Traces for Antidistillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11545)
*Jiayu Ding,Lei Cui,Li Dong,Nanning Zheng,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PART方法，通过重新表述推理轨迹来防止未经授权的模型蒸馏，同时保留对人类用户有用的中间信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的详细推理轨迹虽然有助于用户理解和验证，但也容易被用于未经授权的模型蒸馏。现有保护策略往往过度简化推理过程，剥夺了用户的宝贵信息。

Method: 设计了两步重新表述方法：移除自对话行为并重新排序子结论。训练一个小型辅助模型来执行这种重新表述，计算开销很小。

Result: 实验表明PART能有效干扰各种规模和类型的学生模型的蒸馏过程。例如，在AIME 2024上，32B学生模型的性能从54.17下降到46.88，下降了13.5%。

Conclusion: PART方法在保护模型知识产权的同时，保留了推理轨迹对人类用户的价值，实现了信息保护与可用性之间的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show that extending the
length of reasoning chains significantly improves performance on complex tasks.
While revealing these reasoning traces helps users better follow, verify, and
learn from the model's problem-solving process, it also makes them highly
vulnerable to unauthorized distillation. To mitigate this risk, proprietary
model providers often adopt aggressive protection strategies, such as replacing
detailed reasoning with brief summaries, which deprive users of valuable
intermediate information. To address this trade-off, we propose PART, an
information-preserving antidistillation reformulation of reasoning traces.
Motivated by the difference between how humans understand reasoning traces and
how LLMs exploit them for supervised fine-tuning, we design a simple but
effective two-step reformulation: removing self-talk behaviors and reordering
sub-conclusions. A small auxiliary model is trained to perform this
reformulation, incurring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PART consistently disrupts distillation across student models
of different sizes and types on various reasoning benchmarks. For instance,
when training on reformulated traces, even the performance of a large 32B
student model decreases from 54.17 to 46.88 on AIME 2024, corresponding to a
13.5% degradation.

*Saurabh Khanna,Xinxu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了全球语言在AI系统中的不平等现象，提出了连接语言活力与数字存在的分析框架，识别出四种语言类别，揭示了殖民时代语言等级制度在当代AI发展中的延续。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在大量多语言语料上训练，但全球约2000种语言、数百万使用者仍被数字生态系统忽视，这种语言不平等并非偶然而是结构性的。

Method: 通过分析所有记录的人类语言数据，将语言按活力（现实世界人口强度）和数字性（在线存在）分为四类：Strongholds、Digital Echoes、Fading Voices和Invisible Giants。

Result: 发现27%的语言属于"隐形巨人"类别，即拥有高活力但数字存在几乎为零，这些语言有数百万使用者却被排除在LLM生态系统之外。

Conclusion: 英语在AI中的主导地位不是技术必然，而是权力结构的产物，系统性地排除了边缘化语言知识，需要去殖民化语言技术并民主化AI利益获取。

Abstract: Large Language Models are trained on massive multilingual corpora, yet this
abundance masks a profound crisis: of the world's 7,613 living languages,
approximately 2,000 languages with millions of speakers remain effectively
invisible in digital ecosystems. We propose a critical framework connecting
empirical measurements of language vitality (real world demographic strength)
and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic
injustice to explain why linguistic inequality in AI systems is not incidental
but structural. Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we
identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality),
Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices
(36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high
vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent
from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities
from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development,
constituting what we term digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals
that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of
power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge.
We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and
democratizing access to AI benefits.

Motivation: 现有衡量LLMs文化适应能力的基准与模型在实际多样化文化背景用户交互中面临的挑战不匹配。

Method: 基于社会文化理论构建框架，形式化语言风格如何受情境、关系和文���背景影响，创建由多样化文化评分者标注的基准数据集，并提出跨文化评估的新标准。

Result: 评估显示当前顶级LLMs在对话场景中的文化适应能力存在困难。

Conclusion: 需要更好的框架和基准来评估LLMs在多文化对话环境中的文化适应能力，现有模型在这方面表现不佳。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks that measure cultural adaptation in LLMs are misaligned
with the actual challenges these models face when interacting with users from
diverse cultural backgrounds. In this work, we introduce the first framework
and benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multicultural
conversational settings. Grounded in sociocultural theory, our framework
formalizes how linguistic style - a key element of cultural communication - is
shaped by situational, relational, and cultural context. We construct a
benchmark dataset based on this framework, annotated by culturally diverse
raters, and propose a new set of desiderata for cross-cultural evaluation in
NLP: conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness.
We evaluate today's top LLMs on our benchmark and show that these models
struggle with cultural adaptation in a conversational setting.

TL;DR: LLMAtKGE是一个基于大语言模型的对抗攻击框架，通过结构化提示和多选择问题设计，在知识图谱嵌入攻击中实现目标选择和可解释攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的黑盒攻击方法无法生成人类可读的解释，且泛化能力差。大语言模型在文本理解、生成和推理方面展现出强大能力，可解决这些问题。

Method: 设计结构化提示方案将攻击表述为多选择问题，引入基于语义和中心性的过滤器压缩候选集，预计算高阶邻接矩阵并微调LLM进行三元组分类以提升过滤性能。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的知识图谱数据集上，该方法超越了最强的黑盒基线，提供了推理解释，并与白盒方法相比表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: LLMAtKGE框架能有效生成可解释的对抗攻击，在攻击性能和解释能力方面均表现优异。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) aim to disrupt the
model's ability of link prediction by removing or inserting triples. A recent
black-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural
information to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate
human-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past
few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities
in text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose
LLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates
human-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context
under limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that
explicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while
incorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and
hesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters,
which compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of
attack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both
semantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order
adjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance
filtering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets
demonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and
provides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance
compared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies
further validate its capability to generate explanations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MeTA-LoRA是一个两阶段优化框架，通过在少样本条件下学习任务特定适配器，然后聚合多任务梯度来提升知识迁移，显著提高了多任务适应中的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LoRA方法在单任务设置中有效，但在多任务学习中难以高效利用任务间知识，需要大量任务特定数据才能达到最优性能。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段使用少量样本学习任务特定LoRA适配器；第二阶段通过聚合多任务梯度更新共享LoRA适配器，促进跨任务知识迁移。

Result: 在多任务学习和多语言学习场景中，该方法匹配或超越了传统全数据LoRA微调方法的性能，同时使用了显著更少的任务特定数据。

Conclusion: MeTA-LoRA框架有效解决了多任务适应中的数据效率问题，通过两阶段优化实现了更好的知识迁移和性能表现。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely used
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for adapting large language
models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. While highly effective in single-task
settings, it struggles to efficiently leverage inter-task knowledge in complex
multi-task learning scenarios, often requiring substantial task-specific data
to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce
MeTA-LoRA, a two-stage optimization framework that significantly improves data
efficiency in multi-task adaptation. In the first stage, task-specific LoRA
adapters are learned using only a few samples from each involved dataset,
enabling rapid adaptation without large-scale supervision. In the second stage,
the shared LoRA adapter is updated by aggregating gradients from multiple tasks
to promote knowledge transfer across tasks, further reducing data usage by
leveraging common patterns. In both multi-task learning and multilingual
learning scenarios, our method matches or surpasses the performance of
traditional full-data LoRA fine-tuning approaches, while using significantly
less task-specific data.

TL;DR: 提出SemCSE-Multi框架，为科学摘要生成多方面的嵌入向量，支持细粒度相似度评估和用户驱动的可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入方法通常只能生成单一表示，无法捕捉科学文献的不同方面，限制了细粒度分析和可视化能力。

Method: 采用无监督方法生成方面特定的摘要句，训练嵌入模型将语义相关摘要映射到嵌入空间邻近位置，然后蒸馏到统一模型中实现单次前向预测。

Result: 在入侵生物学和医学领域验证了框架有效性，能够生成多方面嵌入并实现嵌入到自然语言的解码，即使在低维可视化的未占据区域也保持有效性。

Conclusion: SemCSE-Multi提供了可控的相似度评估和自适应可视化，显著提升了用户中心设置中的可解释性。

Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating
multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of
invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually
specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable
similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of
scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that
produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to
map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space.
We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified
embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a
scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we
introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into
natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show
that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in
low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability
in user-centric settings.

TL;DR: 本文系统解构了Transformer注意力机制，发现token混合机制不可或缺，而数学形式和序列依赖性可以大幅简化，特别是在部分层保留标准注意力时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型的成功通常归功于其点积注意力机制，但该机制中各个设计原则的必要性尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 设计受控变体，选择性地放松注意力机制的不同原则，包括在全部层统一应用和在混合架构中仅部分层保留标准注意力。

Result: token混合机制是必需的，其缺失会导致模型性能接近随机；而数学形式和序列依赖性可以大幅放松，特别是在部分层保留标准注意力时。令人惊讶的是，单独失败的变体在与标准注意力交错时也能获得稳健性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对注意力机制有效性的理解，并为简化语言模型而不牺牲性能开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their
dot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design
principles: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token
interactions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to
each input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus
softmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states
(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of
these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically
deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax
these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid
architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical
analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their
absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical
form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when
preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in
isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard
attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our
understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new
avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于logit的知识蒸馏方法采用静态策略，与学生学习过程的动态特性不匹配，对所有令牌采用单一固定温度，导致知识转移效果不佳。

Method: AdaKD框架包含两个协同模块：LATF模块通过监控学生学习稳定性动态调整蒸馏焦点；IDTS模块采用反难度温度缩放策略，对困难令牌使用低温进行针对性纠错，对简单令牌使用高温鼓励学习完整平滑的输出分布。

Result: AdaKD作为即插即用框架，能够在多种模型架构和基准测试中持续提升各种蒸馏方法的性能。

Conclusion: AdaKD通过动态适应每个令牌的实时学习状态，有效解决了传统知识蒸馏方法的局限性，显著提升了知识转移效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale
language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ
static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of
student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and
apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer.
To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge
Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to
the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic
modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven
Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation
focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating
computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase.
Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a
counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low
temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high
temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's
complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a
plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of
various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.

Abstract: Human writers often begin their stories with an overarching mental scene,
where they envision the interactions between characters and their environment.
Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form
story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using
multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic
sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another
and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation
for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression.
Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid
bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more
spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating
stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency,
addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach
offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive
long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.

Motivation: 现有推理时扩展方法在单次前向传播中生成整个推理链，容易因累积错误导致推理轨迹偏离，特别是对于能力有限的小模型和长推理链。研究发现大多数推理错误源于错误的规划步骤。

Result: 在数学、科学和逻辑推理基准测试中，仅使用10%的SFT数据和5%的偏好对，该方法在多个基础模型和任务上均优于DeepSeek-R1蒸馏基线和结果奖励RL基线。

Conclusion: MPPA框架通过计划探索和聚合有效解决了长推理链中的规划错误问题，结合Step-DPO实现了高效训练和更高准确性，为小模型在复杂推理任务上的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model
(LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches
typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which
often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off
course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for
smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we
analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning
and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from
incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan
Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan
exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on
the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them
into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design
in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA
module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that
outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K
tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level
preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo
(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields
more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive
experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method
outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward
RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注数学/编程竞赛或一般任务，缺乏对高水平学术推理能力的严格基准测试。

Method: 构建包含计算机科学、经济学、法学、数学和哲学5个领域的50个专家标注学术问题，所有问题来自顶级期刊并经过严格质量控制。

Conclusion: 当前LLM和智能体在超级智能学术研究任务中存在明显能力差距，Acadreason基准凸显了这一挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, the research focus of large language models (LLMs) and
agents has shifted increasingly from demonstrating novel capabilities to
complex reasoning and tackling challenging tasks. However, existing evaluations
focus mainly on math/code contests or general tasks, while existing
multi-domain academic benchmarks lack sufficient reasoning depth, leaving the
field without a rigorous benchmark for high-level reasoning. To fill this gap,
we introduce the Acadreason benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs
and agents to acquire and reason over academic knowledge. It consists of 50
expert-annotated academic problems across five high-reasoning domains,
including computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy. All
questions are sourced from top-tier publications in recent years and undergo
rigorous annotation and quality control to ensure they are both challenging and
answerable. We conduct systematic evaluations of over 10 mainstream LLMs and
agents. The results show that most LLMs scored below 20 points, with even the

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising
results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain
underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based
approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative
pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals
within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through
analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm
that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve
as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a
Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive
experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),
showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive
refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This
suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm
for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of
GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on
its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource
visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining
before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding
capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at

TL;DR: AMA是首个终身实时基准测试，用于评估基于LLM的交易代理在多个市场中的表现，解决了现有研究测试模型而非代理、覆盖期有限、依赖未验证数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的金融交易代理研究存在测试对象错误（测试模型而非代理）、覆盖期有限、数据未验证等问题，需要建立更严谨的评估框架。

Method: 引入Agent Market Arena (AMA)框架，整合验证交易数据、专家检查新闻和多样化代理架构，实现四种代理（InvestorAgent、TradeAgent、HedgeFundAgent、DeepFundAgent）在多个LLM模型上的实时评估。

Result: 实盘实验显示代理框架表现出明显不同的行为模式（从激进风险承担到保守决策），而模型骨干对结果变异贡献较小。

Conclusion: AMA为基于LLM的金融推理和交易智能的严谨、可复现和持续演化评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in
financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live
markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods
and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce
Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates
verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures
within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison
under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a
single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk
styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them
across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and
Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets
demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral
patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making,
whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus
establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving
evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also
effectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design
principles and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning
in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and
reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic
trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger
SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration
and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are
crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and
maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency.
(iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool
calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy.
Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and
training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with
smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL
research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a
high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL
dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the
agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including
AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes,
4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance
compared to 32B-sized models. Code and models:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了大型推理模型在静态环境下的评估假设，提出了动态场景下的中断和上下文变化测试，发现静态评估高估了模型鲁棒性，性能下降可达60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估假设模型响应是瞬时且上下文不变的，但在现代推理任务中这种"冻结世界"假设不成立，因为模型可能需要数小时思考且上下文会动态变化。

Method: 通过两种现实动态场景评估LRM鲁棒性：中断测试模型在有限预算下的部分输出质量，动态上下文测试模型对飞行中变化的适应能力。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，静态评估一致高估鲁棒性：即使在静态设置中达到高精度的最先进LRM，在中断或上下文变化时也会不可预测地失败。

Conclusion: 揭示了新的失败模式，包括推理泄漏、恐慌和自我怀疑，表明需要开发在动态环境中更鲁棒的推理模型。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are
traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are
assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be
immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for
short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning
tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think
through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model
starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the
frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic
scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs
on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to
in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require
long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:
even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can
fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with
performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the
reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,
including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final
answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon
reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where
performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

Motivation: 系统管理者知道真实到达率，但顾客可能缺乏这一信息而形成任意信念，这种信息不对称会影响排队系统的运行效率。

Method: 提出三级信息不对称层次结构：顾客保持私人信念、顾客了解他人信念、顾客知道真实到达率。在最小限制条件下分析信念分布的影响。

Result: 分析了信念分布对均衡加入概率、收入和社会福利的影响，为系统管理者提供了调节队列的信息披露策略。

Conclusion: 信息不对称对排队系统有显著影响，系统管理者可以通过适当的信息披露策略来优化队列管理。

Abstract: This paper studies information asymmetry in an unobservable single-server
queueing system. While system managers have knowledge of the true arrival rate,
customers may lack this information and instead form arbitrary beliefs. We
propose a three-tier hierarchy of information asymmetry with increasing levels
of information disclosure:customers keep private beliefs, customers are aware
of the beliefs of others, and customers know the true arrival rate. Within this
framework, the effects of the belief distribution, which is assumed to be
general with minimal restrictions, are analyzed in terms of equilibrium joining
probabilities, revenue, and social welfare. Furthermore,strategies for
information disclosure are proposed for system managers to regulate the queue.

Result: 证明了几何边界与标量化隐含边界之间的等价性，特别是在欧几里得空间和两个具有实际意义的无限维空间中。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种统一且通用的边界表征方法，适用于非凸域，并讨论了相关应用。

Abstract: We present a unified approach for characterizing the boundary of a possibly
nonconvex domain. Motivated by the well-known Pascoletti--Serafini method of
scalarization, we recast the boundary characterization as a multi-criteria
optimization problem with respect to a local partial order induced by a
spherical cone with varying orient. Such an approach enables us to trace the
whole boundary and can be considered a general dual representation for
arbitrary (nonconvex) sets satisfying an exterior cone condition. We prove the
equivalence between the geometrical boundary and the scalarization-implied
boundary, particularly in the case of Euclidean spaces and two
infinite-dimensional spaces for practical interest. By reformulating each
scalarized problem as a parameterized constrained optimization problem, we
shall develop a corresponding numerical scheme for the proposed approach. Some
related applications are also discussed.

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将鲁棒决策和学习结合，为不确定性环境下的最优停止问题提供了有效的强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: We propose and analyze a continuous-time robust reinforcement learning
framework for optimal stopping problems under ambiguity. In this framework, an
agent chooses a stopping rule motivated by two objectives: robust
decision-making under ambiguity and learning about the unknown environment.
Here, ambiguity refers to considering multiple probability measures dominated
by a reference measure, reflecting the agent's awareness that the reference
measure representing her learned belief about the environment would be
erroneous. Using the $g$-expectation framework, we reformulate an optimal
stopping problem under ambiguity as an entropy-regularized optimal control
problem under ambiguity, with Bernoulli distributed controls to incorporate
exploration into the stopping rules. We then derive the optimal Bernoulli
distributed control characterized by backward stochastic differential
equations. Moreover, we establish a policy iteration theorem and implement it
as a reinforcement learning algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm across different levels of
ambiguity and exploration.

Motivation: 半定规划是基础凸优化问题，但大规模实例求解计算成本高，需要解决线性系统和特征值分解。量子计算的最新进展为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 开发了不精确ADMM框架，容忍块编码近似和量子测量产生的迭代误差。设计了多项式近端算子处理半定锥约束，应用量子奇异值变换加速最耗时的投影更新。

Result: 在强对偶假设下，该方案收敛到SDP问题的ε最优解。复杂度分析显示QADMM在维度缩放方面优于经典ADMM和量子内点法。

Conclusion: QADMM算法在解决大规模SDP问题方面具有潜力，特别是在维度缩放方面表现出优势。

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a fundamental convex optimization problem
with wide-ranging applications. However, solving large-scale instances remains
computationally challenging due to the high cost of solving linear systems and
performing eigenvalue decompositions. In this paper, we present a quantum
alternating direction method of multipliers (QADMM) for SDPs, building on
recent advances in quantum computing. An inexact ADMM framework is developed,
which tolerates errors in the iterates arising from block-encoding
approximation and quantum measurement. Within this robust scheme, we design a
polynomial proximal operator to address the semidefinite conic constraints and
apply the quantum singular value transformation to accelerate the most costly
projection updates. We prove that the scheme converges to an $\epsilon$-optimal
solution of the SDP problem under the strong duality assumption. A detailed
complexity analysis shows that the QADMM algorithm achieves favorable scaling
with respect to dimension compared to the classical ADMM algorithm and quantum
interior point methods, highlighting its potential for solving large-scale
SDPs.

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust control (DRC) recently emerges as a
principled paradigm for handling uncertainty in stochastic dynamical systems.
However, it constructs data-driven ambiguity sets via uniform distribution
shifts before sequentially incorporating them into downstream control
synthesis. This segregation between ambiguity set construction and control
objectives inherently introduces a structural misalignment, which undesirably
leads to conservative control policies with sub-optimal performance. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end finite-horizon Wasserstein DRC
framework that integrates the learning of anisotropic Wasserstein metrics with
downstream control tasks in a closed-loop manner, thus enabling ambiguity sets
to be systematically adjusted along performance-critical directions and
yielding more effective control policies. This framework is formulated as a
bilevel program: the inner level characterizes dynamical system evolution under
DRC, while the outer level refines the anisotropic metric leveraging
control-performance feedback across a range of initial conditions. To solve
this program efficiently, we develop a stochastic augmented Lagrangian
algorithm tailored to the bilevel structure. Theoretically, we prove that the
learned ambiguity sets preserve statistical finite-sample guarantees under a
novel radius adjustment mechanism, and we establish the well-posedness of the
bilevel formulation by demonstrating its continuity with respect to the
learnable metric. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm converges to
stationary points of the outer level problem, which are statistically
consistent with the optimal metric at a non-asymptotic convergence rate.
Experiments on both numerical and inventory control tasks verify that the
proposed framework achieves superior closed-loop performance and robustness
compared against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The reconstruction of an unknown quantity from noisy measurements is a
mathematical problem relevant in most applied sciences, for example, in medical
imaging, radar inverse scattering, or astronomy. This underlying mathematical
problem is often an ill-posed (non-linear) reconstruction problem, referred to
as an ill-posed inverse problem. To tackle such problems, there exist a myriad
of methods to design approximate inverse maps, ranging from optimization-based
approaches, such as compressed sensing, over Bayesian approaches, to
data-driven techniques such as deep learning. For all stable approximate
inverse maps, there are accuracy limits that are strictly larger than zero for
ill-posed inverse problems, due to the accuracy-stability tradeoff [Gottschling
et al., SIAM Review, 67.1 (2025)] and [Colbrook et al., Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, 119.12 (2022)]. The variety of methods that aim
to solve such problems begs for a unifying approach to help scientists choose
the approximate inverse map that obtains this theoretical optimum. Up to now
there do not exist computable accuracy bounds to this optimum that are
applicable to all inverse problems. We provide computable sharp accuracy bounds
to the reconstruction error of solution methods to inverse problems. The bounds
are method-independent and purely depend on the dataset of signals, the forward
model of the inverse problem, and the noise model. To facilitate the use in
scientific applications, we provide an algorithmic framework and an
accompanying software library to compute these accuracy bounds. We demonstrate
the validity of the algorithms on two inverse problems from different domains:
fluorescence localization microscopy and super-resolution of multi-spectral
satellite data. Computing the accuracy bounds for a problem before solving it,
enables a fundamental shift towards optimizing datasets and forward models.

Abstract: A stochastic mixed-integer programming model is developed to address the
power distribution system repair and restoration following failures caused by
extreme events such as natural disasters. This model addresses the complex
challenge of efficiently assigning and dispatching repair crews to minimize
both downtime and the extent of outages, following the crew sequence
constraints. By incorporating a realistic transportation network, our model
accounts for uncertainties in repair times, repair demand at damaged nodes, and
potential transportation network failures. This ensures uncertainty awareness
and mitigation, providing coordinated schedules for the repair crews, assigned
based on the severity of failures at each node. Our approach prioritizes
components in the distribution network based on their potential for power
restoration, while also considering the constraints imposed by the actual
transportation network. A case study using an 8500-bus system, coupled with a
real-world transportation network at the Dallas-Fort Worth area, demonstrating
the effectiveness of this approach, is discussed. The proposed methodology
emphasizes rapid power restoration and efficient repair crew routing over an
integrated transportation and power network, demonstrating results that match
or outperform conventional metaheuristic solvers for classical vehicle routing
problems in a deterministic instance.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel model framework that integrates deep neural
networks with the Ridgelet Transform. The Ridgelet Transform on Borel
measurable functions is used for arbitrage detection on high-dimensional sparse
structures. This transform also enhances the expressive power of neural
networks, enabling them to capture complex and high-dimensional market
structures. Theoretically, we determine profitable trading strategies by
optimizing hybrid ridgelet deep neural networks. Further, we emphasize the role
of activation functions in ensuring stability and adaptability under
uncertainty. We use a high-performance computing cluster for the detection of
arbitrage across multiple assets, ensuring scalability, and processing
large-scale financial data. Empirical results demonstrate strong profitability
across diverse scenarios involving up to 50 assets, with particularly robust
performance during periods of market volatility.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于有效多孔介质模型的TPMS换热器壁厚分布优化方法，通过优化非均匀壁厚设计，使性能评价标准(PEC)相比均匀壁厚设计提高了12.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度TPMS结构具有空间变化的壁厚，有望进一步提高换热器性能，但需要高效的优化方法来设计壁厚分布。

Method: 基于有效多孔介质模型开发壁厚分布优化方法，显著降低计算成本，应用于gyroid双流体换热器以改善热工水力性能。

Result: 优化壁厚设计使PEC提高了12.2%，主要归因于优化的非均匀壁厚将更多流体导向核心端部并增强速度均匀性。

Conclusion: 优化的非均匀壁厚设计能够更有效地利用整个换热器核心，提高整体热性能，证明了该方法在TPMS换热器优化中的有效性。

Abstract: Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures are attracting growing
attention as promising geometries for next-generation high-performance heat
exchangers (HXs), due to their continuous flow paths and high
surface-area-to-volume ratio that enhance heat transfer performance. Among
these, graded TPMS structures with spatially varying thickness have emerged as
a potential means to further improve performance. This study proposes an
optimization method of wall thickness distribution for TPMS HXs based on an
effective porous media model, which allows accurate performance prediction
while significantly reducing computational cost. The proposed method is applied
to a gyroid two-fluid HX aiming to improve the thermal-hydraulic performance.
Furthermore, full-scale numerical simulations of the optimized-thickness design
show a 12.2% improvement in the performance evaluation criterion (PEC) compared
to the uniform-thickness design. The improvement is primarily attributed to the
optimized non-uniform wall thickness, which directs more flow toward the core
ends and enhances velocity uniformity. As a result, heat transfer is enhanced
at the core ends, leading to more effective use of the entire HX core and
improved overall thermal performance.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了重尾噪声下的二阶优化问题，提出了基于梯度和Hessian裁剪的新算法，并建立了匹配下界的样本复杂度理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重尾噪声在现代机器学习中普遍存在，但现有的二阶方法在重尾噪声下缺乏理论保证和鲁棒性，这正是最需要鲁棒性的场景。

Method: 提出了两种算法：1) 利用二阶信息的归一化随机梯度下降变体；2) 基于梯度和Hessian裁剪的新算法，以处理大偏差引起的不稳定性。

Result: 建立了重尾噪声下二阶优化的紧下界，并证明所提算法能够匹配这些下界，提供了高概率上界。

Conclusion: Hessian裁剪是重尾噪声下二阶算法设计的鲁棒且理论完备的策略，首次全面刻画了重尾噪声下二阶优化的样本复杂度。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise is pervasive in modern machine learning applications,
arising from data heterogeneity, outliers, and non-stationary stochastic
environments. While second-order methods can significantly accelerate
convergence in light-tailed or bounded-noise settings, such algorithms are
often brittle and lack guarantees under heavy-tailed noise -- precisely the
regimes where robustness is most critical. In this work, we take a first step
toward a theoretical understanding of second-order optimization under
heavy-tailed noise. We consider a setting where stochastic gradients and
Hessians have only bounded $p$-th moments, for some $p\in (1,2]$, and establish
tight lower bounds on the sample complexity of any second-order method. We then
develop a variant of normalized stochastic gradient descent that leverages
second-order information and provably matches these lower bounds. To address
the instability caused by large deviations, we introduce a novel algorithm
based on gradient and Hessian clipping, and prove high-probability upper bounds
that nearly match the fundamental limits. Our results provide the first
comprehensive sample complexity characterization for second-order optimization
under heavy-tailed noise. This positions Hessian clipping as a robust and
theoretically sound strategy for second-order algorithm design in heavy-tailed
regimes.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了Hadamard空间中随机近端点算法的收敛性分析，首次将Hilbert空间中的相关工作扩展到Hadamard流形，并构造了显式收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将随机近端点算法从Hilbert空间推广到非线性Hadamard空间，解决随机扰动单调向量场的零点逼近问题。

Method: 在可分离Hadamard空间中定义随机近端点算法，利用强单调性假设、概率独立性假设和切空间可分离性假设证明收敛性。

Result: 证明了算法在均值和几乎必然意义下的收敛性，构造了高度均匀的显式收敛速率，这些速率在Hilbert空间背景下也是新颖的。

Conclusion: 该工作首次将随机近端点算法扩展到Hadamard流形，提供了有效的收敛证明和显式收敛速率，在附加二阶矩条件下还讨论了线性非渐近保证。

Abstract: We define a stochastic variant of the proximal point algorithm in the general
setting of nonlinear (separable) Hadamard spaces for approximating zeros of the
mean of a stochastically perturbed monotone vector field and prove its
convergence under a suitable strong monotonicity assumption, together with a
probabilistic independence assumption and a separability assumption on the
tangent spaces. As a particular case, our results transfer previous work by P.
Bianchi on that method in Hilbert spaces for the first time to Hadamard
manifolds. Moreover, our convergence proof is fully effective and allows for
the construction of explicit rates of convergence for the iteration towards the
(unique) solution both in mean and almost surely. These rates are moreover
highly uniform, being independent of most data surrounding the iteration, space
or distribution. In that generality, these rates are novel already in the
context of Hilbert spaces. Linear nonasymptotic guarantees under additional
second-moment conditions on the Yosida approximates and special cases of
stochastic convex minimization are discussed.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于瞬态热方程的动态线路评级优化框架，通过直接约束导体温度而非稳态近似，显著提升电网容量和降低发电成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源渗透率提高和AI数据中心、电气化带来的负荷快速增长，缓解线路拥塞对于释放额外电网容量变得至关重要。

Method: 开发了嵌入导体温度动态瞬态热方程的优化框架，推导热方程的闭式解实现有限维重构，采用双层ADMM分布式分解算法。

Result: 在2000总线德克萨斯电网上的数值实验表明，相比静态线路评级和环境调整评级，DLR显著降低了拥塞系统的发电成本。

Conclusion: 瞬态温度公式以最小计算开销提供了额外的电网灵活性和容量余量优势。

Abstract: As power grids experience increasing renewable penetration and rapid load
growth from AI data centers and electrification, alleviating line congestion
becomes critical to unlocking additional grid capacity. This work investigates
Dynamic Line Rating (DLR), a congestion mitigation method that adjusts power
line current limits in response to meteorological conditions. Unlike
traditional approaches that impose predefined time-varying limits, we propose a
novel optimization framework that embeds the transient-state heat equation
governing conductor temperature dynamics, enabling direct constraints on
conductor temperature rather than simplified steady-state approximations. We
derive a closed-form solution to the heat equation, enabling a
finite-dimensional reformulation of the dynamics. We then leverage a
distributed decomposition method, a bi-level Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with provable convergence, aided by regularity
properties of the heat equation solution. These modeling and algorithmic
innovations allow us to conduct the first large-scale evaluation of DLR using
multi-period AC optimal power flow. Numerical experiments on the 2000-bus Texas
grid demonstrate that DLR allows significant reduction in generation cost in
congested systems over Static Line Rating (SLR) and Ambient Adjusted Ratings
(AAR). The transient temperature formulation provides additional grid
flexibility and headroom benefits with minimal computational overhead.

*Dirk Lauinger,Luc Coté,Andy Sun*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一个优化模型，用于电力存储同时参与套利和频率调节市场，通过混合整数双线性规划确保在所有市场波动情况下都能履行承诺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电池容量超过辅助服务需求，需要更复杂的交易策略来最大化利润。电力存储同时参与套利和频率调节市场存在协调挑战。

Method: 开发混合整数双线性规划模型，将无限数量的非凸函数约束转化为有限数量的确定性约束，支持混合整数线性松弛和限制。

Result: 在欧洲电力市场的实证测试显示松弛和限制之间的最优性差距可忽略，求解时间小于5秒。2020-2024年回测显示联合市场参与使利润翻倍以上，储能输出减半。

Conclusion: 该模型可作为复杂交易策略的基础模块，有效协调套利和频率调节市场参与，显著提高储能系统经济效益。

Abstract: Electricity storage is used for intertemporal price arbitrage and for
ancillary services that balance unforeseen supply and demand fluctuations via
frequency regulation. We present an optimization model that computes bids for
both arbitrage and frequency regulation and ensures that storage operators can
honor their market commitments at all times for all fluctuation signals in an
uncertainty set inspired by market rules. This requirement, initially expressed
by an infinite number of nonconvex functional constraints, is shown to be
equivalent to a finite number of deterministic constraints. The resulting
formulation is a mixed-integer bilinear program that admits mixed-integer
linear relaxations and restrictions. Empirical tests on European electricity
markets show a negligible optimality gap between the relaxation and the
restriction. The model can account for intraday trading and, with a solution
time of under 5 seconds, may serve as a building block for more complex trading
strategies. Such strategies become necessary as battery capacity exceeds the
demand for ancillary services. In a backtest from 1 July 2020 through 30 June
2024 joint market participation more than doubles profits and almost halves
energy storage output compared to arbitrage alone.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将一阶LP求解器集成到分支定界框架中，为大规模安全约束机组组合问题提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Security-Constrained Unit Commitment is a fundamental optimization problem in
power systems operations. The primary computational bottleneck arises from the
need to solve large-scale Linear Programming (LP) relaxations within
branch-and-cut. Conventional simplex and barrier methods become computationally
prohibitive at this scale due to their reliance on expensive matrix
factorizations. While matrix-free first-order methods present a promising
alternative, their tendency to converge to non-vertex solutions renders them
incompatible with standard branch-and-cut procedures. To bridge this gap, we
propose a successive fixing framework that leverages a customized
GPU-accelerated first-order LP solver to guide a logic-driven variable-fixing
strategy. Each iteration produces a reduced Mixed-Integer Linear Programming
(MILP) problem, which is subsequently tightened via presolving. This iterative
cycle of relaxation, fixing, and presolving progressively reduces problem
complexity, producing a highly tractable final MILP model. When evaluated on
public benchmarks exceeding 13,000 buses, our approach achieves a tenfold
speedup over state-of-the-art methods without compromising solution quality.

Motivation: 现有零阶优化方法中随机有限差分梯度估计存在高方差问题，缺乏高概率收敛保证，且标准方法查询复杂度与维度线性相关，限制了在大规模问题中的应用。

Method: 引入随机草图概念，将梯度估计统一为基于草图的通用公式，通过设计合适的草图矩阵来降低梯度估计方差。

Result: 在凸二次目标上实现了查询复杂度为Õ(tr(A)/L·L/μlog(1/ε))，显著优于标准方法Õ(d·L/μlog(1/ε))，特别当Hessian矩阵特征值快速衰减时优势更明显。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了理解零阶优化中随机有限差分方法为何及何时能实现弱维度无关收敛的新视角，为理论和实践提供了重要基础。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for analyzing zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) from
the perspective of \emph{oblivious randomized sketching}.In this framework,
commonly used gradient estimators in ZOO-such as finite difference (FD) and
random finite difference (RFD)-are unified through a general sketch-based
formulation. By introducing the concept of oblivious randomized sketching, we
show that properly chosen sketch matrices can significantly reduce the high
variance of RFD estimates and enable \emph{high-probability} convergence
guarantees of ZOO, which are rarely available in existing RFD analyses.
  \noindent We instantiate the framework on convex quadratic objectives and
derive a query complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{tr}(A)/L \cdot
L/\mu\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ to achieve a $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution,
where $A$ is the Hessian, $L$ is the largest eigenvalue of $A$, and $\mu$
denotes the strong convexity parameter. This complexity can be substantially
smaller than the standard query complexity of ${\cO}(d\cdot L/\mu
\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ that is linearly dependent on problem dimensionality,
especially when $A$ has rapidly decaying eigenvalues. These advantages
naturally extend to more general settings, including strongly convex and
Hessian-aware optimization.
  \noindent Overall, this work offers a novel sketch-based perspective on ZOO
that explains why and when RFD-type methods can achieve \emph{weakly
dimension-independent} convergence in general smooth problems, providing both
theoretical foundations and practical implications for ZOO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于梅奥诊所真实数据，发现患者治疗时长呈现不对称分布特征，需要设计能够处理这种不对称性和多模态不确定性的优化方法，以提高化疗调度效率。

Method: 使用分布鲁棒优化模型，构建包含多模态和不对称特征的模糊集，考虑模式概率和每个模式内分布的矩信息（均值、方差、半方差）。开发了精确算法和基于聚类的启发式算法。

Result: 通过合成数据集和梅奥诊所真实数据的数值实验，验证了所提算法的有效性和效率，展示了在DRO模型中纳入不对称信息的优势。

Conclusion: 将治疗时间相似的患者类型分组可以降低最优成本，所提出的方法能够有效处理化疗调度中的不对称多模态不确定性。

Abstract: We consider a real-world chemotherapy scheduling template design problem,
where we cluster patient types into groups and find a representative time-slot
duration for each group to accommodate all patient types assigned to that
group, aiming to minimize the total expected idle time and overtime. From Mayo
Clinic's real data, most patients' treatment durations are asymmetric (e.g.,
shorter/longer durations tend to have a longer right/left tail). Motivated by
this observation, we consider a distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
model under an asymmetric and multi-modal ambiguity set, where the distribution
of the random treatment duration is modeled as a mixture of distributions from
different patient types. The ambiguity set captures uncertainty in both the
mode probabilities, modeled via a variation-distance-based set, and the
distributions within each mode, characterized by moment information such as the
empirical mean, variance, and semivariance. We reformulate the DRO model as a
semi-infinite program, which cannot be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. To
overcome this, we derive a closed-form expression for the worst-case expected
cost and establish lower and upper bounds that are positively related to the
variability of patient types assigned to each group, based on which we develop
exact algorithms and highly efficient clustering-based heuristics. The lower
and upper bounds on the worst-case cost imply that the optimal cost tends to
decrease if we group patient types with similar treatment times. Through
numerical experiments based on both synthetic datasets and Mayo Clinic's real
data, we illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed exact
algorithms and heuristics and showcase the benefits of incorporating asymmetric
information into the DRO formulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geoffrion定理是数学规划中评估拉格朗日松弛质量的基本结果，但通常隐含假设可行解集是有限的或由有理线性约束描述。本文旨在研究当这一条件不满足时定理的有效性。

Method: 通过构造具体反例展示当可行解集不是有限集或不能用有限线性约束描述时，Geoffrion定理可能失效，然后提供确保结果成立的充分条件。

Result: 证明了在缺乏有限性或有限线性约束描述的条件下，Geoffrion定理的结论不一定成立，但可以通过特定充分条件来保证其有效性。

Conclusion: Geoffrion定理的适用性依赖于可行解集的性质，当不满足传统假设时需要额外的充分条件来确保结果的正确性。

Abstract: Geoffrion's theorem is a fundamental result from mathematical programming
assessing the quality of Lagrangian relaxation, a standard technique to get
bounds for integer programs. An often implicit condition is that the set of
feasible solutions is finite or described by rational linear constraints.
However, we show through concrete examples that the conclusion of Geoffrion's
theorem does not necessarily hold when this condition is dropped. We then
provide sufficient conditions ensuring the validity of the result even when the
feasible set is not finite and cannot be described using finitely-many linear
constraints.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了信息不完全情况下的决策理论，建立了信息价值与决策者灵活性之间的等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在状态信息不完全的情况下，如何衡量信息的价值以及决策者灵活性之间的关系。

Method: 使用双线性对偶将效用行为与信念配对，引入闭凸综合效用行为集来表征决策者，并应用Minkowski加法和dioid代数结构分析决策者的灵活性。

Result: 证明决策者M比决策者L更重视信息当且仅当M的效用行为集可通过Minkowski加法从L的集合得到，这等价于M在融合操作上比L更灵活。

Conclusion: 信息价值与决策者的融合灵活性之间存在等价关系，为理解不完全信息下的决策行为提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: We consider decision-making under incomplete information about an unknown
state of nature. Utility acts (that is, utility vectors indexed by states of
nature) and beliefs (probability distributions over the states of nature) are
naturally paired by bilinear duality, giving the expected utility. With this
pairing, an expected utility maximizer (DM) is characterized by a continuous
closed convex comprehensive set of utility acts (c-utility act set). We show
that DM M values information more than DM L if and only if the c-utility act
set of DM M is obtained by Minkowski addition from the cutility act set of DM
L. In the classic setting of decision theory, this is interpreted as the
equivalence between more valuable information, on the one hand, and multiplying
decisions and adding utility, on the other hand (additively separable utility).
We also introduce the algebraic structure of dioid to describe two operations
between DMs: union (adding options) and fusion (multiplying options and adding
utilities). We say that DM M is more exible by union (resp. by fusion) than DM
L if DM M is obtained by union (resp. by fusion) from DM L. Our main result is
that DM M values information more than DM L if and only if DM M is more exible
by fusion than DM L. We also study when exibility by union can lead to more
valuable information.

Abstract: In ergodic singular stochastic control problems, a decision-maker can
instantaneously adjust the evolution of a state variable using a control of
bounded variation, with the goal of minimizing a long-term average cost
functional. The cost of control is proportional to the magnitude of
adjustments. This paper characterizes the optimal policy and the value in a
class of multi-dimensional ergodic singular stochastic control problems. These
problems involve a linearly controlled one-dimensional stochastic differential
equation, whose coefficients, along with the cost functional to be optimized,
depend on a multi-dimensional uncontrolled process Y. We first provide general
verification theorems providing an optimal control in terms of a Skorokhod
reflection at Y-dependent free boundaries, which emerge from the analysis of an
auxiliary Dynkin game. We then fully solve two two-dimensional optimal
inventory management problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
paper to establish a connection between multi-dimensional ergodic singular
stochastic control and optimal stopping, and to exploit this connection to
achieve a complete solution in a genuinely two-dimensional setting.

noise assumptions. We compare the proposed algorithms with baseline methods on
diverse tasks from machine learning including neural network training.

Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear optimization-based model reduction method for
multiscale stochastic optimal control problems governed by stochastic partial
differential equations. The proposed approach constructs a non-intrusive,
data-driven reduced-order model by employing a parameter-separable structure to
handle stochastic dependencies and directly minimizing the L2 norm of the
output error via gradient-based optimization. Compared to existing methods,
this framework offers three significant advantages: it is entirely data-driven,
relying solely on output measurements without requiring access to internal
system matrices; it guarantees approximation accuracy for control outputs,
aligning directly with the optimization objective; and its computational
complexity is independent of the original PDE dimension, ensuring feasibility
for real-time control applications. Numerical experiments on stochastic

*Fabio Ancona,Mohamed Bentaibi,Francesco Rossi*

Main category: math.OC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究网络系统达成共识的条件对理论和应用都至关重要，特别是在连接暂时丢失的情况下更具挑战性。

Method: 基于Moreau条件，分析图长度对收敛速度的影响，证明指数收敛性。

Result: 证明了已知条件能确保指数收敛到共识，并给出了明确的收敛速率。发现图长度越大收敛越慢。

Conclusion: 该通用结果也为连接缺失的二阶协作系统的收敛提供了条件。

Abstract: Finding conditions ensuring consensus, i.e. convergence to a common value,
for a networked system is of crucial interest, both for theoretical reasons and
applications. This goal is harder to achieve when connections between agents
are temporarily lost.
  Here, we prove that known conditions (introduced by Moreau) ensure an
exponential convergence to consensus, with explicit rate of convergence. The
key result is related to the length of the graph (i.e. the number of
connections to reach a common agent): if this is large, then convergence is
slow.
  This general result also provides conditions for convergence of second-order
cooperative systems with lack of connections.

Abstract: We develop an optimal control model for allocating agricultural crop residues
between bioenergy production and soil fertility restoration. The system
captures a novel circular feedback: a fraction of cumulative energy output is
reinvested into soil productivity, linking energy use with ecological
regeneration. The dynamics are governed by a nonlinear three-state system
describing soil fertility, residue biomass, and accumulated energy, with a
single control representing the proportion of biomass diverted to energy. The
objective is to maximize a discounted net benefit that accounts for energy
revenue, soil value, and operational costs. We apply the Pontryagin Maximum
Principle in current-value form to derive necessary optimality conditions and
characterize the structure of optimal controls. Numerical simulations based on
direct optimization reveal interior and switching regimes, and show how
planning horizon and reinvestment efficiency influence optimal strategies. The
results highlight the strategic role of energy reinvestment in achieving
sustainable residue management.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of maintaining the safe operation of
Waste-to-Energy (WtE) systems under operational constraints and uncertain waste
inflows. We model this as a robust viability problem, formulated as a zero-sum
differential game between a control policy and an adversarial disturbance.
Within a Hamilton-Jacobi framework, the viability kernel is characterized as
the zero sublevel set of a value function satisfying a constrained
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the viscosity sense. This formulation
provides formal guarantees for ensuring that system trajectories remain within
prescribed operational limits under worst-case scenarios. Compared to existing
viability studies, this work introduces a rigorous HJB-based characterization
explicitly incorporating uncertainty, tailored to nonlinear WtE dynamics. A
numerical scheme based on the Local Lax-Friedrichs method is employed to
approximate the viability kernel. Numerical experiments illustrate how
increasing inflow uncertainty significantly reduces the viability domain,
shrinking the safe operating envelope. The proposed method is computationally
tractable for systems of moderate dimension and offers a basis for synthesizing
robust control policies, contributing to the design of resilient and
sustainable WtE infrastructures.

Abstract: This work is concerned with variational analysis of so-called spectral
functions and spectral sets of matrices that only depend on eigenvalues of the
matrix. Based on our previous work [H. T. B\`ui, M. N. B\`ui, and C. Clason,
Convex analysis in spectral decomposition systems, arXiv 2503.14981] on convex
analysis of such functions, we consider the question in the abstract framework
of spectral decomposition systems, which covers a wide range of previously
studied settings, including eigenvalue decomposition of Hermitian matrices and
singular value decomposition of rectangular matrices, and allows deriving new
results in more general settings such as normal decomposition systems and
signed singular value decompositions. The main results characterize Fr\'echet
and limiting normal cones to spectral sets as well as Fr\'echet, limiting, and
Clarke subdifferentials of spectral functions in terms of the reduced
functions. For the latter, we also characterize Fr\'echet differentiability.
Finally, we obtain a generalization of Lidski\u{\i}'s theorem on the spectrum
of additive perturbations of Hermitian matrices to arbitrary spectral
decomposition systems.

Abstract: Selecting an effective step-size is a fundamental challenge in first-order
optimization, especially for problems with non-Euclidean geometries. This paper
presents a novel adaptive step-size strategy for optimization algorithms that
rely on linear minimization oracles, as used in the Conditional Gradient or
non-Euclidean Normalized Steepest Descent algorithms. Using a simple heuristic
to estimate a local Lipschitz constant for the gradient, we can determine
step-sizes that guarantee sufficient decrease at each iteration. More
precisely, we establish convergence guarantees for our proposed Adaptive
Conditional Gradient Descent algorithm, which covers as special cases both the
classical Conditional Gradient algorithm and non-Euclidean Normalized Steepest
Descent algorithms with adaptive step-sizes. Our analysis covers optimization
of continuously differentiable functions in non-convex, quasar-convex, and
strongly convex settings, achieving convergence rates that match
state-of-the-art theoretical bounds. Comprehensive numerical experiments
validate our theoretical findings and illustrate the practical effectiveness of
Adaptive Conditional Gradient Descent. The results exhibit competitive
performance, underscoring the potential of the adaptive step-size for
applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates the a-posteriori analysis of Branch-and-Bound~(BB)
trees to extract structural information about the feasible region of
mixed-binary linear programs. We introduce three novel outer approximations of
the feasible region, systematically constructed from a BB tree. These are: a
tight formulation based on disjunctive programming, a branching-based
formulation derived from the tree's branching logic, and a mixing-set
formulation derived from the on-off properties inside the tree. We establish an
inclusion hierarchy, which ranks the approximations by their theoretical
strength \wrt to the original feasible region. The analysis is extended to the
generation of valid inequalities, revealing a separation-time hierarchy that
mirrors the inclusion hierarchy in reverse. This highlights a trade-off between
the tightness of an approximation and the computational cost of generating cuts
from it. Motivated by the computational expense of the stronger approximations,
we introduce a new family of valid inequalities called star tree inequalities.
Although their closure forms the weakest of the proposed approximations, their
practical appeal lies in an efficient, polynomial-time combinatorial separation
algorithm. A computational study on multi-dimensional knapsack and set-covering
problems empirically validates the theoretical findings. Moreover, these
experiments confirm that computationally useful valid inequalities can be
generated from BB trees obtained by solving optimization problems considered in
practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最小二乘方法对结构化噪声（如不确定二进制标签和对抗噪声）不够鲁棒，需要开发能够处理这类噪声的鲁棒优化模型。

Method: 基于噪声传播矩阵的几何结构（列向量形成的角度），将内层最大化问题分类为超模或子模问题，分别设计投影梯度算法、修正框架和双贪婪算法来求解。

Result: 对于超模情况，线性问题可在O(ε⁻²)迭代内找到ε-全局极小极大点，非线性问题在O(ε⁻⁴)迭代内找到期望意义下的ε-稳定点；对于子模情况，可在O(ε⁻²)迭代内找到(1/3, ε)-近似极小极大点。

Conclusion: BRLS模型在健康状态预测和相位恢复实验中展现出比传统最小二乘和LASSO更好的抗结构化噪声鲁棒性，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We propose a Binary Robust Least Squares (BRLS) model that encompasses key
robust least squares formulations, such as those involving uncertain binary
labels and adversarial noise constrained within a hypercube. We show that the
geometric structure of the noise propagation matrix, particularly whether its
columns form acute or obtuse angles, implies the supermodularity or
submodularity of the inner maximization problem. This structural property
enables us to integrate powerful combinatorial optimization tools into a
gradient-based minimax algorithmic framework. For the robust linear least
squares problem with the supermodularity, we establish the relationship between
the minimax points of BRLS and saddle points of its continuous relaxation, and
propose a projected gradient algorithm computing $\epsilon$-global minimax
points in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. For the robust nonlinear least squares
problem with supermodularity, we develop a revised framework that finds
$\epsilon$-stationary points in the sense of expectation within
$O(\epsilon^{-4})$ iterations. For the robust linear least squares problem with
the submodularity, we employ a double greedy algorithm as a subsolver,
guaranteeing a $(\frac{1}{3}, \epsilon)$-approximate minimax point in
$O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. Numerical experiments on health status
prediction and phase retrieval demonstrate that BRLS achieves superior
robustness against structured noise compared to classical least squares
problems and LASSO.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实用高效，还形成了一个有趣的动力系统，连续平均场版本分析显示类似行为特征。

Abstract: We suppose we are given a list of points $x_1, \dots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}$, a
target probability measure $\mu$ and are asked to add additional points
$x_{n+1}, \dots, x_{n+m}$ so that $x_1, \dots, x_{n+m}$ is as close as possible
to the distribution of $\mu$; additionally, we want this to be true uniformly
for all $m$. We propose a simple method that achieves this goal. It selects new
points in regions where the existing set is lacking points and avoids regions
that are already overly crowded. If we replace $\mu$ by another measure $\mu_2$
in the middle of the computation, the method dynamically adjusts and allows us
to keep the original sampling points. $x_{n+1}$ can be computed in
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ steps and we obtain state-of-the-art results. It appears to be
an interesting dynamical system in its own right; we analyze a continuous
mean-field version that reflects much of the same behavior.

Abstract: We study convex composite optimization problems, where the objective function
is given by the sum of a prox-friendly function and a convex function whose
subgradients are estimated under heavy-tailed noise. Existing work often
employs gradient clipping or normalization techniques in stochastic first-order
methods to address heavy-tailed noise. In this paper, we demonstrate that a
vanilla stochastic algorithm -- without additional modifications such as
clipping or normalization -- can achieve optimal complexity for these problems.
In particular, we establish that an accelerated stochastic proximal subgradient
method achieves a first-order oracle complexity that is universally optimal for
smooth, weakly smooth, and nonsmooth convex optimization, as well as for
stochastic convex optimization under heavy-tailed noise. Numerical experiments
are further provided to validate our theoretical results.

Conclusion: 将随机分析与现代深度学习相结合，扩展了可解决的路径依赖金融模型类别，消融实验证实了序列到路径表示和二阶结构的互补增益。

Abstract: We present a deep BSDE and 2BSDE solver that combines truncated log
signatures with a neural rough differential equation backbone for high
dimensional, path dependent valuation and control. The design aligns stochastic
analysis with sequence to path learning, using a CVaR tilted objective to
emphasize left tail risk and an optional second order head for risk sensitive
control. Under equal compute and parameter budgets, the method improves
accuracy, tail fidelity, and training stability across Asian and barrier option
pricing and portfolio control tasks. At 200 dimensions, it achieves CVaR(0.99)
= 9.8 percent compared to 12.0-13.1 percent for strong baselines, while
attaining low HJB residuals and small RMSE for Z and Gamma. Ablations confirm
complementary gains from the sequence to path representation and the second

Abstract: In this work, we combine the mean-field game theory with the classical idea
of binomial tree framework, pioneered by Sharpe and Cox, Ross & Rubinstein, to
solve the equilibrium price formation problem for the stock. For agents with
exponential utilities and recursive utilities of exponential type, we prove the
existence of a unique mean-field equilibrium and derive an explicit formula for
equilibrium transition probabilities of the stock price by restricting its
trajectories onto a binomial tree. The agents are subject to stochastic
terminal liabilities and incremental endowments, both of which are dependent on
unhedgeable common and idiosyncratic factors, in addition to the stock price
path. Finally, we provide numerical examples to illustrate the qualitative
effects of these components on the equilibrium price distribution.

Abstract: This paper presents a sequential convex programming (SCP) framework for
ensuring the continuous-time satisfaction of compound state-triggered
constraints, a subset of logical specifications, in the powered descent
guidance (PDG) problem. The proposed framework combines the generalized
mean-based smooth robustness measure (D-GMSR), a parameterization technique
tailored for expressing discrete-time temporal and logical specifications
through smooth functions, with the continuous-time successive convexification
(CT-SCvx) method, a real-time solution for constrained trajectory optimization
that guarantees continuous-time constraint satisfaction and convergence. The
smoothness of the temporal and logical specifications parameterized via D-GMSR
enables solving the resulting optimization problem with robust and efficient
SCP algorithms while preserving theoretical guarantees. In addition to their
smoothness, the parameterized specifications are sound and complete, meaning
the specification holds if and only if the constraint defined by the
parameterized function is satisfied. The CT-SCvx framework is then applied to
solve the parameterized problem, incorporating: (1) reformulation for
continuous-time path constraint satisfaction, (2) time-dilation to transform
the free-final-time PDG problem into a fixed-final-time problem, (3) multiple
shooting for exact discretization, (4) exact penalty functions for penalizing
nonconvex constraints, and (5) the prox-linear method, a convergence-guaranteed
SCP algorithm, to solve the resulting finite-dimensional nonconvex PDG problem.
The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a numerical
simulation. The implementation is available at
https://github.com/UW-ACL/CT-cSTC

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic approach to construct control barrier
functions for nonlinear control affine systems subject to arbitrary state and
input constraints. Taking inspiration from the reference governor literature,
the proposed method defines a family of backup policies, parametrized by the
equilibrium manifold of the system. The control barrier function is defined on
the augmented state-and-reference space: given a state-reference pair, the
approach quantifies the distance to constraint violation at any time in the
future, should the current backup policy reference remain constant. Sensitivity
analysis is then used to compute the (possibly nonsmooth) Jacobian with respect
to the augmented state vector. To showcase its simple yet general nature, the
proposed method is applied to an inverted pendulum on cart.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑箱并网逆变器稳定性评估方法需要大量数据且受限于专有内部结构，难以实现轻量化高效评估。

Method: 使用单个连续时间神经网络参数化系统微分方程，通过潜在扰动特征引导学习过程，同时捕获非线性大信号动态和小信号特征结构。

Result: 仅需48个短时瞬态数据即可实现百分位级别的轨迹预测误差和十分位级别的特征值估计误差，训练样本需求比传统方法少1-2个数量级。

Conclusion: LFI-NODE为复杂黑箱电力电子系统提供了一种实用且轻量化的高保真稳定性评估方法。

Abstract: Stability evaluation of black-box grid-tied inverters is vital for grid
reliability, yet identification techniques are both data-hungry and blocked by
proprietary internals. {To solve this, this letter proposes a
latent-feature-informed neural ordinary differential equation (LFI-NODE)
modeling method that can achieve lightweight stability evaluation directly from
trajectory data.} LFI-NODE parameterizes the entire system ODE with a single
continuous-time neural network, allowing each new sample to refine a unified
global model. It faithfully captures nonlinear large-signal dynamics to
preserve uniform predictive accuracy as the inverter transitions between
operating points. Meanwhile, latent perturbation features distilled from every
trajectory steer the learning process and concurrently reveal the small-signal
eigenstructure essential for rigorous stability analysis. Validated on a
grid-forming inverter, {The LFI-NODE requires one to two orders of magnitude
fewer training samples compared with traditional methods, collected from short
time-domain trajectories instead of extensive frequency-domain measurements.}
{Furthermore, the LFI-NODE requires only 48 short transients to achieve a
trajectory prediction error at the hundredth level and an eigenvalue estimation
error at the tenth level, outperforming benchmark methods by one to two orders
of magnitude.} This makes LFI-NODE a practical and lightweight approach for
achieving high-fidelity stability assessment of complex black-box
power-electronic systems.

Abstract: Electric power systems are undergoing fundamental change. The shift to
inverter-based generation challenges frequency stability, while growing
digitalisation heightens vulnerability to errors and attacks. Here we identify
an emerging risk at the intersection of cyber-physical coupling and control
system design. We show that grid frequency time series worldwide exhibit a
persistent one-minute oscillatory pattern, whose origin has remained largely
unexplained. We trace this pattern back to the energy management systems of
battery electric storage systems and demonstrate that the pattern amplitude has
increased substantially in the Nordic and British grids. We argue that this
effect is a potential burden for stability in future grids with low inertia and
an increasing penetration with batteries and smart devices, though it can be
mitigated by a revision of battery control algorithms.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理非凸安全集问题，实现实时安全控制

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have seen widespread success in providing
forward invariance and safety guarantees for dynamical control systems. A
crucial limitation of discrete-time formulations is that CBFs that are
nonconcave in their argument require the solution of nonconvex optimization
problems to compute safety-preserving control inputs, which inhibits real-time
computation of control inputs guaranteeing forward invariance. This paper
presents a novel method for computing safety-preserving control inputs for
discrete-time systems with nonconvex safety sets, utilizing convex optimization
and the recently developed class of matrix control barrier function techniques.
The efficacy of our methods is demonstrated through numerical simulations on a
bicopter system.

Result: 证明了粘性CBFs与控制屏障值函数之间的等价关系，粘性CBFs具有控制不变性和边界平滑接近等安全保证性质，且在最大和极限运算下保持闭包。

Conclusion: 通过粘性CBFs成功桥接了CBF和HJR框架，为安全控制提供了统一的理论基础，并展示了粘性CBFs的良好理论性质。

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) and Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) are
central frameworks in safe control. Traditionally, these frameworks have been
viewed as distinct, with the former focusing on optimally safe controller
design and the latter providing sufficient conditions for safety. A previous
work introduced the notion of a control barrier value function (CB-VF), which
is defined similarly to the other value functions studied in HJR but has
certain CBF-like properties. In this work, we proceed the other direction by
generalizing CBFs to non-differentiable ``viscosity'' CBFs. We show the deep
connection between viscosity CBFs and CB-VFs, bridging the CBF and HJR
frameworks. Through this bridge, we characterize the viscosity CBFs as
precisely those functions which provide CBF-like safety guarantees (control
invariance and smooth approach to the boundary). We then further show nice
theoretical properties of viscosity CBFs, including their desirable closure
under maximum and limit operations. In the process, we also extend CB-VFs to
non-exponential anti-discounting and update the corresponding theory for CB-VFs
along these lines.

Abstract: We investigate the potential impact of communication and human performance
uncertainties on runway operations. Specifically, we consider these impacts
within the context of an arrival scenario with two converging flows: a
straight-in approach stream and a downwind stream merging into it. Both arrival
stream are modeled using a modified Possion distribution that incorporate the
separation minima as well as the runway occupancy time. Various system level
uncertainties are addressed in this process, including communication link- and
human-related uncertainties. In this research, we first build a Monte
Carlo-based discrete-time simulation, where aircraft arrivals are generated by
modified Poisson processes subject to minimum separation constraints,
simulating various traffic operations. The merging logic incorporates standard
bank angle continuous turn-to-final, pilot response delays, and dynamic gap
availability in real time. Then, we investigate an automated final approach
vectoring model (i.e., Auto-ATC), in which inverse optimal control is used to
learn decision advisories from human expert records. By augmenting trajectories
and incorporating the aforementioned uncertainties into the planning scenario,
we create a setup analogous to the discrete event simulation. For both studies,
runway capacity is measured by runway throughput, the fraction of downwind
arrivals that merge immediately without holding, and the average delay (i.e.,
holding time/distance) experienced on the downwind leg. This research provides
a method for runway capacity estimation in merging scenarios, and demonstrates
that aeronautical communication link uncertainties significantly affect runway
capacity in current voice-based operations, whereas the impact can be mitigated
in autonomous operational settings.

Abstract: The design of the performance index, also referred to as cost or reward
shaping, is central to both optimal control and reinforcement learning, as it
directly determines the behaviors, trade-offs, and objectives that the
resulting control laws seek to achieve. A commonly used approach for this
inference task in recent years is differentiable trajectory optimization, which
allows gradients to be computed with respect to cost parameters by
differentiating through an optimal control solver. However, this method often
requires repeated solving of the underlying optimal control problem at every
iteration, making the method computationally expensive. In this work, assuming
known dynamics, we propose a novel framework that analytically links the
performance index to the resulting closed-loop optimal control law, thereby
transforming a typically bi-level inverse problem into a tractable single-level
formulation. Our approach is motivated by the question: given a closed-loop
control law that solves an infinite-horizon optimal control problem, how does
this law change when the performance index is modified with additional terms?
This formulation yields closed-form characterizations for broad classes of
systems and performance indices, which not only facilitate interpretation and
stability analysis, but also provide insight into the robust stability and
input-to-state stable behavior of the resulting nonlinear closed-loop system.
Moreover, this analytical perspective enables the generalization of our
approach to diverse design objectives, yielding a unifying framework for
performance index shaping. Given specific design objectives, we propose a
systematic methodology to guide the shaping of the performance index and
thereby design the resulting optimal control law.

Abstract: Local bifurcation analysis plays a central role in understanding qualitative
transitions in networked nonlinear dynamical systems, including dynamic neural
network and opinion dynamics models. In this article we establish explicit
bounds of validity for the classification of bifurcation diagrams in two
classes of continuous-time networked dynamical systems, analogous in structure
to the Hopfield and the Firing Rate dynamic neural network models. Our approach
leverages recent advances in computing the bounds for the validity of
Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, a reduction method widely employed in nonlinear
systems analysis. Using these bounds we rigorously characterize neighborhoods
around bifurcation points where predictions from reduced-order models remain
reliable. We further demonstrate how these bounds can be applied to an
illustrative family of nonlinear opinion dynamics on k-regular graphs, which
emerges as a special case of the general framework. These results provide new
analytical tools for quantifying the robustness of bifurcation phenomena in
dynamics over networked systems and highlight the interplay between network
structure and nonlinear dynamical behavior.

Conclusion: 该框架成功识别出高度节能的不对称脉冲，可用于方向选择性神经参与，有望实现选择性快速率重复TMS协议，降低功耗和线圈发热，提升神经调控的精度和效力。

Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with asymmetric electric field
pulses, such as monophasic, offers directional selectivity for neural
activation but requires excessive energy. Previous pulse shape optimisation has
been limited to symmetric pulses or heavily constrained variations of
conventional waveforms without achieving general optimality in energy
efficiency or neural selectivity. We implemented an optimisation framework that
incorporates neuron model activation constraints and flexible control of pulse
asymmetry. The optimised electric field waveforms achieved up to 92 % and 88 %
reduction in energy loss and thus coil heating respectively compared to
conventional monophasic pulses and previously improved monophasic-equivalent
pulses. In the human experiments, OUR pulses showed similar motor thresholds to
monophasic pulses in both AP and PA directions with significantly lower energy
loss, particularly in the AP direction. Moreover, there was a significant MEP
latency difference of (1.79 +/- 0.41) ms between AP and PA direction with OUR
pulses, which suggests directional selectivity. Our framework successfully
identified highly energy-efficient asymmetric pulses for
directionally-selective neural engagement. These pulses can enable selective
rapid-rate repetitive TMS protocols with reduced power consumption and coil
heating, with potential benefits for precision and potency of neuro-modulation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose symbolic decision trees as surrogate models for
approximating model predictive control laws. The proposed approach learns
simultaneously the partition of the input domain (splitting logic) as well as
local nonlinear expressions for predicting the control action leading to
interpretable piecewise nonlinear control laws. The local nonlinear expressions
are determined by the learning problem and are modeled using a set of basis
functions. The learning task is posed as a mixed integer optimization, which is
solved to global optimality with state-of-the-art global optimization solvers.
We apply the proposed approach to a case study regarding the control of an
isothermal reactor. The results show that the proposed approach can learn the
control law accurately, leading to closed-loop performance comparable to that
of a standard model predictive controller. Finally, comparison with existing
interpretable models shows that the symbolic trees achieve both lower
prediction error and superior closed-loop performance.

Conclusion: 该框架在安全性和性能之间实现了良好平衡，能够在障碍物避让后快速恢复轨迹，有效处理自动驾驶中的不确定性。

Abstract: This paper presents a risk-budgeted monitor with a control framework that
certifies safety for autonomous driving. In this process, a sliding window is
proposed to monitor for insufficient barrier residuals or nonzero tail risk,
ensuring system safety. When the safety margin deteriorates, it triggers
switching the safety constraint from a performance-based relaxed-control
barrier function (R-CBF) to a conservative conditional value at risk (CVaR-CBF)
to address the safety concern. This switching is governed by two real-time
triggers: Feasibility-Triggered (FT) and Quality-Triggered (QT) conditions. In
the FT condition, if the R-CBF constraint becomes infeasible or yields a
suboptimal solution, the risk monitor triggers the use of the CVaR constraints
for the controller. In the QT condition, the risk monitor observes the safety
margin of the R-CBF solution at every step, regardless of feasibility. If it
falls below the safety margin, the safety filter switches to the CVaR-CBF
constraints.
  The proposed framework is evaluated using a model predictive controller (MPC)
for autonomous driving in the presence of autonomous vehicle (AV) localization
noise and obstacle position uncertainties. Multiple AV-pedestrian interaction
scenarios are considered, with 1,500 Monte Carlo runs conducted for all
scenarios. In the most challenging setting with pedestrian detection
uncertainty of 5 m, the proposed framework achieves a 94-96% success rate of
not colliding with the pedestrians over 300 trials while maintaining the lowest
mean cross-track error (CTE = 3.2-3.6 m) to the reference path. The reduced CTE
indicates faster trajectory recovery after obstacle avoidance, demonstrating a
balance between safety and performance.

guarantees. To deal with the unknown dynamics, we utilize Gaussian process
regression to approximate the model. Finally, we implement the controller
synthesized by the proposed scheme on a manipulator example

Conclusion: 项目具有成本效益，但必须考虑屋顶系统完整性和整体电气系统升级的总成本，进行更严格的经济评估。

Abstract: The study is anchored to the principles of Nearly-Zero Energy Building
(NZEB). It aimed to transform the Tarlac State University Gymnasium into a
facility with energy-efficient equipment to contribute to reducing carbon
footprints by integrating a solar PV system as its renewable energy source. The
researchers found out that the electrical infrastructure of the Gym was
outdated, and the lighting was not energy efficient, and there were too few
convenience or power outlets. There was also insufficient cooling equipment to
maintain a comfortable temperature. Analysis shows that the payback period is
within the average range, making it a cost-effective investment for the
University. Aside from the cost of the PV System, adherence to engineering
design standards will mean additional costs to replace the metal halides with
LED high bay lamps, installation of additional air conditioning units, and
provision of additional convenience outlets. These additional costs should be
considered when evaluating the feasibility of the project. It is recommended
that the integrity of the existing roof system of the Gymnasium be considered.
The total cost of putting up the whole electrical system, including new
lighting, cooling, and convenience loads, must be calculated to determine the
total cost of implementing the whole NZEB project. Other factors in the
economic evaluation may be considered to determine a more stringent result.

Abstract: Coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) can engender flexibility
necessary to improve grid reliability. Packetized Energy Management (PEM) is a
method for coordinating DERs, such as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs)
and electric vehicles, within customer quality-of-service (QoS) limits. In PEM,
a DER uses local information to offer flexibility by sending a request to the
DER coordinator to turn-ON or turn-OFF. Much work has focused on modeling and
analyzing aggregations of DERs under PEM with fixed packet durations and only
turn-ON requests. Different recent efforts to enable variable packet lengths
have shown an increase in available flexibility and ramping capability, but
have not been modeled in aggregate, which limits systematic analyses. To
address this issue, this paper presents a new aggregate bin-based (macro) model
of PEM loads that incorporates both turn-ON and turn-OFF request features,
enabling the model to accurately characterize the capability of the fleet of
DERs to track a power reference signal, population temperature dynamics,
aggregate request rates, and variable packet lengths. Simulation-based
validation is performed against an agent-based (micro) model to evaluate
robustness and quantify model accuracy. Finally, the distribution of variable
packet lengths from macro-model simulations are applied to inform past work on
PEM with randomized packet lengths

Abstract: Physically interpretable models are essential for next-generation industrial
systems, as these representations enable effective control, support design
validation, and provide a foundation for monitoring strategies. The aim of this
paper is to develop a system identification framework for estimating modal
models of complex multivariable mechanical systems from frequency response
data. To achieve this, a two-step structured identification algorithm is
presented, where an additive model is first estimated using a refined
instrumental variable method and subsequently projected onto a modal form. The
developed identification method provides accurate, physically-relevant,
minimal-order models, for both generally-damped and proportionally damped modal
systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through
experimental validation on a prototype wafer-stage system, which features a
large number of spatially distributed actuators and sensors and exhibits
complex flexible dynamics.

measurements. It also highlights the limitations of calibrating such models.
Second, we introduce a Kalman filtering method to calibrate the der_a model.
Since we account for nonlinear effects such as saturation and deadbands, we
develop a specific mechanism to handle smoothing functions within the Kalman
filter. Specifically, we consider the extended and the unscented Kalman filter.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a modified IEEE
34-node distribution feeder with inverter-based resources. Our findings align
with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation's parameterization
guideline and underscore the importance of model calibration in accurately
capturing the collective dynamics of distributed energy resources installed on
distribution systems.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个多模态交通和电力流优化模型，用于评估交通-电力耦合系统的协调运行效益，通过联合优化车辆调度、路径选择、充电站排队等关键决策，实现可持续交通能源系统的协同设计。


<details>

Abstract: The electrification of transportation represents a critical challenge in the
global transition toward net-zero emissions, as the sector often accounts for
more than one-quarter of national energy consumption. Achieving this
transformation requires not only widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs)
but also their seamless integration into interdependent infrastructure
systems-specifically, the transportation-electricity nexus (TEN). This paper
develops an optimal multi-modal transportation and electric power flow (OMTEPF)
model to evaluate the benefits of coordinated, dynamic system operation.
Building on recent advances in hetero-functional graph theory, the framework
enables joint optimization of five key operational decisions in intelligent TEN
management: vehicle dispatch, route choice, charging station queuing,
coordinated charging, and vehicle-to-grid stabilization. The mesoscopic,
dynamic model explicitly represents individual EVs and their state-of-charge
trajectories, thereby extending beyond the prevailing literature's focus on
static, macroscopic traffic assignment. It further captures the full scope of
the TEN as a system-of-systems, incorporating five distinct charging
modalities: private residential, private commercial, wired public commercial,
inductive public, and discharging. On the power system side, an IV-ACOPF
formulation ensures globally optimal solutions to the electrical subproblems.
Comparative analysis demonstrates the substantial value of coordinated TEN
operation relative to the status quo of siloed, uncoordinated infrastructure
management. This work provides both a novel methodological contribution and
actionable insights for the co-design and operation of next-generation
sustainable mobility-energy systems.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了对模块化功能部署(MFD)方法的增强，将装配设计(DFA)逻辑集成到架构合成中，以解决MFD在早期概念和系统级开发中缺乏装配考虑的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模块化产品设计需要在产品多样性和运营效率之间取得平衡，但现有的MFD方法缺乏对装配考虑的系统支持，这增加了生产爬坡延迟和生命周期效率低下的风险。

Method: 扩展的MFD方法引入了结构化启发式、面向装配的模块驱动因素、编码接口分类法和定量指标，用于评估装配可行性和自动化准备度，同时保持与标准MFD工作流程的兼容性。

Result: 通过手持吹叶机的案例研究表明，重新设计的架构减少了装配工作量，简化了接口，并提高了自动化潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过装配视角支持早期阶段对架构替代方案的评估，能够更快地过渡到高效的批量生产，并为产品生命周期中的持续改进提供基础。

Abstract: Modular product design has become a strategic enabler for companies seeking
to balance product variety, operational efficiency, and market responsiveness,
making the alignment between modular architecture and manufacturing
considerations increasingly critical. Modular Function Deployment (MFD) is a
widely adopted method for defining modular product architectures, yet it lacks
systematic support for assembly considerations during early concept and
system-level development. This limitation increases the risk of delayed
production ramp-up and lifecycle inefficiencies. This paper proposes a set of
enhancements to MFD that integrate Design for Assembly (DFA) logic into
architectural synthesis. The extended method introduces structured heuristics,
assembly-oriented module drivers, a coded interface taxonomy, and quantitative
metrics for assessing assembly feasibility and automation readiness. These
additions preserve compatibility with standard MFD workflows while enriching
decision-making with traceable, production-informed reasoning. An illustrative
case study involving a handheld leaf blower demonstrates the method's usability
and effectiveness. The redesigned architecture shows reduced assembly effort,
simplified interfaces, and increased automation potential. By supporting
early-stage evaluation of architectural alternatives through an assembly lens,
the method enables faster transition to efficient volume production and
provides a foundation for continuous improvement throughout the product
lifecycle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统铁路容量计算方法依赖固定交通组成假设，无法适应不同服务类型（货运与客运）的竞争性运营需求，需要动态容量分配方法。

Result: 在巴黎附近铁路枢纽的基准测试中，该方法显著优于固定交通组成模型，证明了动态容量分配的优势。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效计算动态交通分布下的铁路枢纽容量，为长期交通分配问题提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The efficiency of railway infrastructure is significantly influenced by the
mix of trains that utilize it, as different service types have competing
operational requirements. While freight services might require extended service
times, passenger services demand more predictable schedules. Traditional
methods for addressing long-term traffic assignment problems often rely on
fixed-value capacity limitations, determined based on specific assumptions
about traffic composition. This paper introduces a methodology for determining
timetable-independent capacity within the traffic rate assignment problem,
enabling the calculation of junction capacities under dynamic traffic
distributions. We solve the underlying non-linear constrained optimization
problem maximizing the traffic throughput using Bayesian optimization (BO).
This setting combines a known objective function with expensive- to-compute
capacity constraints, motivating an adaption of standard BO problems, where
objective functions are usually unknown. We tailor the acquisition process in
BO to this specific setting and increase performance by incorporating prior
knowledge about the shape of the constraint functions into the Gaussian process
surrogate model. Our derived approaches are benchmarked on a railway junction
near Paris, significantly outperforming fixed traffic composition models and
highlighting the benefits of dynamic capacity allocation.

Motivation: 现代电网面临数据生成位置与处理位置不匹配的问题：保护继电器、电动汽车充电和分布式可再生能源需要在边缘进行毫秒级分析，而能耗大的工作负载往往位于遥远的云端，导致错过实时截止期限和浪费电力。

Method: 提出了SDEN框架，包括：(i)联合任务卸载公式，在明确URLLC约束下耦合计算放置与网络容量；(ii)保持可行性的轻量级贪婪启发式算法；(iii)分层AI管道-边缘反应式、雾预测式、云战略式，采用隐私保护的联邦图神经网络进行故障检测和微电网协调。

Conclusion: 与之前仅边缘或仅云端的方案不同，SDEN通过统一计算架构和分层AI方法，成功解决了电网实时分析的延迟和能源效率问题，为电网计算服务提供了可行的软件定义解决方案。

Abstract: Modern power grids face an acute mismatch between where data is generated and
where it can be processed: protection relays, EV (Electric Vehicle) charging,
and distributed renewables demand millisecond analytics at the edge, while
energy-hungry workloads often sit in distant clouds leading to missed real-time
deadlines and wasted power. We address this by proposing, to our knowledge, the
first-ever SDEN (Software Defined Energy Network) for CaaS
(Computations-as-a-Service) that unifies edge, fog, and cloud compute with 5G
URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications), SDN (Software Defined
Networking), and NFV (Network Functions Virtualization) to co-optimize energy,
latency, and reliability end-to-end. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a
joint task offloading formulation that couples computation placement with
network capacity under explicit URLLC constraints; (ii) a feasibility
preserving, lightweight greedy heuristic that scales while closely tracking
optimal energy and latency trade-offs; and (iii) a tiered AI (Artificial
Intelligence) pipeline-reactive at the edge, predictive in the fog, strategic
in the cloud-featuring privacy-preserving, federated GNNs (Graph Neural
Networks) for fault detection and microgrid coordination. Unlike prior
edge-only or cloud-only schemes, SDEN turns fragmented grid compute into a
single, programmable substrate that delivers dependable, energy-aware, real
time analytics establishing a first-ever, software defined path to practical,
grid-scale CaaS.

TL;DR: pyspect是一个Python工具箱，通过时态逻辑树简化了时态逻辑问题的可达性分析，使复杂的安全性和活性需求规范独立于具体的可达性技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在信息物理系统中满足复杂需求需要大量手动工作和领域专业知识来开发可达性程序，这种高开发成本限制了可达性分析在复杂验证问题中的广泛应用。

Method: pyspect提供了一种方法无关的方法，通过时态逻辑树执行可达性分析来验证时态逻辑规范，支持使用高级逻辑公式来指定复杂需求，独立于任何特定的可达性技术或集合表示。

Result: pyspect允许比较不同可达性实现（如Hamilton-Jacobi和混合Zonotope基可达性分析）对相同时态逻辑规范的效果，通过简单的车辆示例展示了其简化可达性程序合成、促进规范可重用性和促进可达性技术比较的能力。

Conclusion: pyspect的设计分离了实现开发者（开发可达性数值程序）和最终用户（编写规范）的关注点，简化了复杂任务的规范编写和可达性分析过程。

Abstract: In this paper, we present pyspect, a Python toolbox that simplifies the use
of reachability analysis for temporal logic problems. Currently, satisfying
complex requirements in cyber-physical systems requires significant manual
effort and domain expertise to develop the underlying reachability programs.
This high development effort limits the broader adoption of reachability
analysis for complex verification problems. To address this, pyspect provides a
method-agnostic approach to performing reachability analysis for verifying a
temporal logic specification via temporal logic trees (TLTs). It enables the
specification of complex safety and liveness requirements using high-level
logic formulations that are independent of any particular reachability
technique or set representation. As a result, pyspect allows for the comparison
of different reachability implementations, such as Hamilton-Jacobi and Hybrid
Zonotope-based reachability analysis, for the same temporal logic
specification. This design separates the concerns of implementation developers
(who develop numerical procedures for reachability) and end-users (who write
specifications). Through a simple vehicle example, we demonstrate how pyspect
simplifies the synthesis of reachability programs, promotes specification
reusability, and facilitates side-by-side comparisons of reachability
techniques for complex tasks.

Conclusion: 基于推测解码的边缘LLM服务框架能有效降低服务延迟，通过联合优化策略显著提升系统性能，为边缘LLM推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference at the network edge is a promising
serving paradigm that leverages distributed edge resources to run inference
near users and enhance privacy. Existing edge-based LLM inference systems
typically adopt autoregressive decoding (AD), which only generates one token
per forward pass. This iterative process, compounded by the limited
computational resources of edge nodes, results in high serving latency and
constrains the system's ability to support multiple users under growing
demands.To address these challenges, we propose a speculative decoding
(SD)-based LLM serving framework that deploys small and large models across
heterogeneous edge nodes to collaboratively deliver inference services.
Specifically, the small model rapidly generates draft tokens that the large
model verifies in parallel, enabling multi-token generation per forward pass
and thus reducing serving latency. To improve resource utilization of edge
nodes, we incorporate pipeline parallelism to overlap drafting and verification
across multiple inference tasks. Based on this framework, we analyze and derive
a comprehensive latency model incorporating both communication and inference
latency. Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem for speculation
length, task batching, and wireless communication resource allocation to
minimize total serving latency. To address this problem, we derive the
closed-form solutions for wireless communication resource allocation, and
develop a dynamic programming algorithm for joint batching and speculation
control strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework achieves lower serving latency compared to AD-based serving systems.
In addition,the proposed joint optimization method delivers up to 44.9% latency
reduction compared to benchmark schemes.

Abstract: Fiber optic current sensors (FOCS) are widely adopted in modern power grids
due to high sensitivity, excellent insulation, and strong immunity to
electromagnetic interference. This prominence necessitates precise
investigation into their error sources and corresponding optimization. This
study examines reflective FOCS based on the Faraday effect. A theoretical model
is established to simulate phase error caused by linear birefringence from the
quarter-wave plate. Conventional methods using circular birefringence are
analyzed, revealing inherent limitations. Innovatively, a compensation strategy
employing high-order quarter-wave plates is proposed to effectively eliminate
linear birefringence effects. This approach significantly enhances the accuracy
and practicality of FOCS in precision metrology.

Conclusion: 该批处理模式框架为机载实现提供了更大灵活性，特别适用于空中机器人系统的故障检测与隔离、健康监测和预测性维护应用。

Abstract: A data-driven framework is proposed for online estimation of quadrotor motor
efficiency via residual minimization. The problem is formulated as a
constrained nonlinear optimization that minimizes trajectory residuals between
measured flight data and predictions generated by a quadrotor dynamics model. A
sliding-window strategy enables online estimation, and the optimization is
efficiently solved using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) scheme
combined with a primal-dual interior-point method, with inequality constraints
enforced through a logarithmic barrier function. Robust z-score weighting is
employed to reject outliers, which is particularly effective in motor clipping
scenarios where the proposed estimator exhibits smaller spikes than an EKF
baseline. Compared to traditional filter-based approaches, the batch-mode
formulation offers greater flexibility by selectively incorporating informative
data segments. This structure is well-suited for onboard implementation,
particularly for applications such as fault detection and isolation (FDI),
health monitoring, and predictive maintenance in aerial robotic systems.
Simulation results under various degradation scenarios demonstrate the accuracy
and robustness of the proposed estimator.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel robust closed-form control law to handle
time-varying hard and soft constraints in uncertain high-relative-degree
nonlinear MIMO systems. These constraints represent spatiotemporal
specifications in mechanical systems' operational space, with hard constraints
ensuring safety-critical requirements and soft constraints encoding performance
or task objectives. Initially, all constraints are consolidated into two
separate scalar time-varying hard and soft constraint functions, whose positive
level sets define feasible regions. A closed-form control law is developed to
enforce these constraints using appropriately designed reciprocal barriers and
nonlinear transformation functions. When conflicts between hard and soft
constraints arise, the control law prioritizes hard constraints by virtually
relaxing soft constraints via a dynamic relaxation law. Notably, the proposed
control law maintains low complexity by avoiding approximation schemes for
coping with system uncertainties. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

Abstract: Critical real-world applications strongly rely on Cyber-physical systems

security risks, as attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to compromise their
integrity and availability. This work explores the topic of cybersecurity in
the context of CPS modeled as discrete event systems (DES), focusing on
recovery strategies following the detection of cyberattacks. Specifically, we
address actuator enablement attacks and propose a method that preserves the
system's full valid behavior under normal conditions. Upon detecting an attack,
our proposed solution aims to guide the system toward a restricted yet robust
behavior, ensuring operational continuity and resilience. Additionally, we
introduce a property termed AE-robust recoverability, which characterizes the
necessary and sufficient conditions for recovering a system from attacks while
preventing further vulnerabilities. Finally, we showcase the proposed solution
through a case study based on a manufacturing system.

Abstract: This paper presents the first closed-loop control framework for cooperative

Conclusion: 柔性连接具有广泛潜力，能够在不频繁干扰负荷的情况下，大幅提升电网对大型负荷的承载能力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the role of flexible connection in accelerating the
interconnection of large loads amid rising electricity demand from data centers
and electrification. Flexible connection allows new loads to defer or curtail
consumption during rare, grid-constrained periods, enabling faster access
without major infrastructure upgrades. To quantify how flexible connection
unlocks load hosting capacity, we formulate a flexibility-aware hosting
capacity analysis problem that explicitly limits the number of
utility-controlled interventions per year, ensuring infrequent disruption.
Efficient solution methods are developed for this nonconvex problem and applied
to real load data and test feeders. Empirical results reveal that modest
flexibility, i.e., few interventions with small curtailments or delays, can
unlock substantial hosting capacity. Theoretical analysis further explains and
generalizes these findings, highlighting the broad potential of flexible
connection.

Abstract: Batteries degrade with usage and continuous cycling. This aging is typically
reflected through the resistance growth and the capacity fade of battery cells.
Over the years, various charging methods have been presented in the literature
that proposed current profiles in order to enable optimal, fast, and/or
health-conscious charging. However, very few works have attempted to make the
ubiquitous Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) charging protocol adaptive
to the changing battery health as it cycles. This work aims to address this gap
and proposes a framework that optimizes the constant current part of the CCCV
protocol adapting to long-term battery degradation. Specifically, a
physics-informed Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach has been used that not
only estimates a key battery degradation mechanism, namely, Loss of Active
Material (LAM), but also adjusts the current magnitude of CCCV as a result of
this particular degradation. The proposed framework has been implemented by
combining PyBamm, an open-source battery modeling tool, and Stable-baselines
where the RL agent was trained using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
network. Simulation results show the potential of the proposed framework for
enhancing the widely used CCCV protocol by embedding physics information in RL
algorithm. A comparative study of this proposed agent has also been discussed
with 2 other charging protocols generated by a non-physics-based RL agent and a
constant CCCV for all the cycles.

Abstract: In this work, we address the issue of controller synthesis for a
control-affine nonlinear system to meet prescribed time reach-avoid-stay

spatiotemporal tubes (STTs) by eliminating the need for circumvent functions,
which often lead to abrupt tube modifications and high control effort. We
propose an adaptive framework that constructs smooth STTs around static unsafe

derived to ensure the system trajectory remains within the tube and satisfies
the RAS task. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated
through a case study, showing a significant reduction in control effort
compared to prior methods.

Abstract: We present an analysis on the convergence properties of the so-called
geometric heat flow equation for computing geodesics (shortest-path~curves) on
Riemannian manifolds. Computing geodesics numerically in real-time has become
an important capability in several fields, including control and motion
planning. The geometric heat flow equation involves solving a parabolic partial
differential equation whose solution is a geodesic. In practice, solving this
PDE numerically can be done efficiently, and tends to be more numerically
stable and exhibit a better rate of convergence compared to numerical
optimization. We prove that the geometric heat flow equation is globally
exponentially stable in $L_2$ if the curvature of the Riemannian manifold is
not too positive, and that asymptotic convergence in $L_2$ is always
guaranteed. We also present a pseudospectral method that leverages Chebyshev
polynomials to accurately compute geodesics in only a few milliseconds for
non-contrived manifolds. Our analysis was verified with our custom
pseudospectral method by computing geodesics on common non-Euclidean surfaces,
and in feedback for a contraction-based controller with a non-flat metric for a
nonlinear system.

Abstract: The rise of large-scale pretrained models has made it feasible to generate
predictive or synthetic features at low cost, raising the question of how to
incorporate such surrogate predictions into downstream decision-making. We
study this problem in the setting of online linear contextual bandits, where
contexts may be complex, nonstationary, and only partially observed. In
addition to bandit data, we assume access to an auxiliary dataset containing
fully observed contexts--common in practice since such data are collected
without adaptive interventions. We propose PULSE-UCB, an algorithm that
leverages pretrained models trained on the auxiliary data to impute missing
features during online decision-making. We establish regret guarantees that
decompose into a standard bandit term plus an additional component reflecting
pretrained model quality. In the i.i.d. context case with H\"older-smooth
missing features, PULSE-UCB achieves near-optimal performance, supported by
matching lower bounds. Our results quantify how uncertainty in predicted
contexts affects decision quality and how much historical data is needed to
improve downstream learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种微调方法来改善生成模型的校准问题：松弛损失和奖励损失，显著降低了校准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型经常存在校准问题，即采样分布的类别概率和其他统计数据偏离期望值，这影响了模型的可靠性。

Method: 将校准问题构建为带约束的优化问题，提出两种替代目标：(1) 松弛损失，用校准误差惩罚替代约束；(2) 奖励损失，将校准转化为奖励微调问题。

Result: 这些方法在数百个同时约束和高达十亿参数的模型中显著减少了校准误差，涵盖蛋白质设计、图像生成和语言建模等应用。

Conclusion: 提出的松弛损失和奖励损失方法是解决生成模型校准问题的有效方法，能够在大规模模型中实现更好的校准性能。

Abstract: Generative models frequently suffer miscalibration, wherein class
probabilities and other statistics of the sampling distribution deviate from
desired values. We frame calibration as a constrained optimization problem and
seek the closest model in Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfying calibration
constraints. To address the intractability of imposing these constraints
exactly, we introduce two surrogate objectives for fine-tuning: (1) the relax
loss, which replaces the constraint with a miscalibration penalty, and (2) the
reward loss, which converts calibration into a reward fine-tuning problem. We
demonstrate that these approaches substantially reduce calibration error across
hundreds of simultaneous constraints and models with up to one billion
parameters, spanning applications in protein design, image generation, and
language modeling.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于核的自适应数据收集下的分布推断框架，结合双重稳健得分和方差稳定化，通过希尔伯特空间鞅中心极限定理确保渐近正态性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自适应实验通过根据过去结果调整处理分配来提高效率，但这种自适应性破坏了支撑经典渐近理论的i.i.d.假设。同时，许多感兴趣的问题是分布性的，超出了平均效应的范围。

Method: 结合双重稳健得分与方差稳定化，通过希尔伯特空间鞅中心极限定理确保渐近正态性，并引入样本拟合的稳定化检验来控制第一类错误。

Result: 实验表明该方法校准良好，对均值偏移和高阶矩差异都有效，优于仅限于标量效应的自适应基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为自适应数据收集下的分布推断提供了有效的核方法，能够处理超出平均效应的分布差异问题。

Abstract: Adaptive experiments improve efficiency by adjusting treatment assignments
based on past outcomes, but this adaptivity breaks the i.i.d. assumptions that
underpins classical asymptotics. At the same time, many questions of interest
are distributional, extending beyond average effects. Kernel treatment effects
(KTE) provide a flexible framework by representing counterfactual outcome
distributions in an RKHS and comparing them via kernel distances. We present
the first kernel-based framework for distributional inference under adaptive
data collection. Our method combines doubly robust scores with variance
stabilization to ensure asymptotic normality via a Hilbert-space martingale
CLT, and introduces a sample-fitted stabilized test with valid type-I error.
Experiments show it is well calibrated and effective for both mean shifts and
higher-moment differences, outperforming adaptive baselines limited to scalar
effects.

Conclusion: NeVI-Cut是一种准确、模块化的反馈切断方法，通过神经网络变分推理实现了计算效率和精度的平衡，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In many scientific applications, uncertainty of estimates from an earlier
(upstream) analysis needs to be propagated in subsequent (downstream) Bayesian
analysis, without feedback. Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes,
achieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents
backward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally
challenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two
variational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model.
In this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural
network-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly
utilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the
upstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis
and reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for
the upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional
variational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional
cut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all
the upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut
estimate to approximate any cut-posterior. Our results are in a fixed-data
regime and provide convergence rates of the actual variational solution,
quantifying how richness of the neural architecture and the complexity of the
target cut-posterior dictate the approximation quality. In the process, we
establish new results on uniform Kullback-Leibler approximation rates of
conditional normalizing flows. Simulation studies and two real-world analyses
illustrate how NeVI-Cut achieves significant computational gains over
traditional cutting feedback methods and is considerably more accurate than
parametric variational cut approaches.

Motivation: 数据科学家在实践中面临三个挑战：(i)共形预测区域的确定只是近似的，危及预测的有限样本有效性；(ii)所需计算可能过于昂贵；(iii)共形预测区域的形状难以控制。

Method: 基于对非一致性度量的单调性、合理性函数单调性和共形预测区域精确确定之间关系的新见解，提出了一个简单策略。

Conclusion: 通过深入理解共形预测中的单调性关系，可以开发出更有效的方法来解决实际应用中的关键问题。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-free machine learning method for creating
prediction regions with a guaranteed coverage probability level. However, a
data scientist often faces three challenges in practice: (i) the determination
of a conformal prediction region is only approximate, jeopardizing the
finite-sample validity of prediction, (ii) the computation required could be
prohibitively expensive, and (iii) the shape of a conformal prediction region
is hard to control. This article offers new insights into the relationship
among the monotonicity of the non-conformity measure, the monotonicity of the
plausibility function, and the exact determination of a conformal prediction
region. Based on these new insights, we propose a simple strategy to alleviate
the three challenges simultaneously.

Main category: stat.ML

Motivation: 虽然STE被广泛用于量化神经网络训练，但量化超参数（如位宽和量化范围）对学习动态的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 在理论分析中，作者证明在高维极限下，STE动态收敛到一个确定性常微分方程，并通过定点分析量化了与未量化线性模型的渐近偏差。

Result: 研究发现STE训练表现出泛化误差的平台期后急剧下降，平台期长度取决于量化范围。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了随机梯度下降的分析技术到权重和输入的非线性变换，揭示了量化超参数对学习动态的重要影响。

Abstract: Quantized neural network training optimizes a discrete, non-differentiable
objective. The straight-through estimator (STE) enables backpropagation through
surrogate gradients and is widely used. While previous studies have primarily
focused on the properties of surrogate gradients and their convergence, the
influence of quantization hyperparameters, such as bit width and quantization
range, on learning dynamics remains largely unexplored. We theoretically show
that in the high-dimensional limit, STE dynamics converge to a deterministic
ordinary differential equation. This reveals that STE training exhibits a
plateau followed by a sharp drop in generalization error, with plateau length
depending on the quantization range. A fixed-point analysis quantifies the
asymptotic deviation from the unquantized linear model. We also extend
analytical techniques for stochastic gradient descent to nonlinear
transformations of weights and inputs.

Abstract: Missing data in online reinforcement learning (RL) poses challenges compared
to missing data in standard tabular data or in offline policy learning. The
need to impute and act at each time step means that imputation cannot be put
off until enough data exist to produce stable imputation models. It also means
future data collection and learning depend on previous imputations. This paper
proposes fully online imputation ensembles. We find that maintaining multiple
imputation pathways may help balance the need to capture uncertainty under
missingness and the need for efficiency in online settings. We consider
multiple approaches for incorporating these pathways into learning and action
selection. Using a Grid World experiment with various types of missingness, we
provide preliminary evidence that multiple imputation pathways may be a useful
framework for constructing simple and efficient online missing data RL methods.

Motivation: 自回归模型依赖数据中的潜在模式，但模式识别往往依赖人类专业知识，错误解释会导致模型错误设定和性能下降。

Conclusion: 时间模式的存在与否从根本上约束了序列模型的可学习性，即使最优预测器也无法超越数据固有的信息限制。

Abstract: Sequential data - ranging from financial time series to natural language -
has driven the growing adoption of autoregressive models. However, these
algorithms rely on the presence of underlying patterns in the data, and their
identification often depends heavily on human expertise. Misinterpreting these
patterns can lead to model misspecification, resulting in increased
generalization error and degraded performance. The recently proposed evolving
pattern (EvoRate) metric addresses this by using the mutual information between
the next data point and its past to guide regression order estimation and
feature selection. Building on this idea, we introduce a general framework
based on predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the
past and the future, $I(X_{past}; X_{future})$. This quantity naturally defines
an information-theoretic learning curve, which quantifies the amount of
predictive information available as the observation window grows. Using this
formalism, we show that the presence or absence of temporal patterns
fundamentally constrains the learnability of sequential models: even an optimal
predictor cannot outperform the intrinsic information limit imposed by the
data. We validate our framework through experiments on synthetic data,
demonstrating its ability to assess model adequacy, quantify the inherent
complexity of a dataset, and reveal interpretable structure in sequential data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为交叉学习分数（CLS）的新指标，通过双向泛化性能来衡量数据集相似性，为迁移学习提供数据选择指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迁移学习可能因数据对齐不佳而损害性能，现有方法主要关注特征分布而忽略标签信息和预测关系，需要更可靠的迁移性评估指标。

Method: CLS通过测量域间双向泛化性能来评估数据集相似性，与目标数据集和源数据集决策边界的余弦相似度有理论关联，计算高效且避免高维分布估计问题。

Result: 在多种合成和真实任务上的实验表明，CLS能可靠预测迁移是否会改善或降低性能，并能将源数据集分类为正向、模糊或负向迁移区域。

Conclusion: CLS提供了一个原则性工具来指导迁移学习中的数据选择，能够有效预测迁移效果并支持明智的决策制定。

Abstract: Transfer learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, as it
can empower models by leveraging knowledge from related domains to improve
learning effectiveness. However, transferring from poorly aligned data can harm
rather than help performance, making it crucial to determine whether the
transfer will be beneficial before implementation. This work aims to address
this challenge by proposing an innovative metric to measure dataset similarity
and provide quantitative guidance on transferability. In the literature,
existing methods largely focus on feature distributions while overlooking label
information and predictive relationships, potentially missing critical
transferability insights. In contrast, our proposed metric, the Cross-Learning
Score (CLS), measures dataset similarity through bidirectional generalization
performance between domains. We provide a theoretical justification for CLS by
establishing its connection to the cosine similarity between the decision
boundaries for the target and source datasets. Computationally, CLS is
efficient and fast to compute as it bypasses the problem of expensive
distribution estimation for high-dimensional problems. We further introduce a
general framework that categorizes source datasets into positive, ambiguous, or
negative transfer zones based on their CLS relative to the baseline error,
enabling informed decisions. Additionally, we extend this approach to
encoder-head architectures in deep learning to better reflect modern transfer
pipelines. Extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world tasks
demonstrate that CLS can reliably predict whether transfer will improve or
degrade performance, offering a principled tool for guiding data selection in
transfer learning.

Conclusion: 该方法在随机森林中实现了有效的迁移学习，距离协方差权重在某些情况下也能提升随机森林性能，在医疗数据应用中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Random forest is an important method for ML applications due to its broad
outperformance over competing methods for structured tabular data. We propose a
method for transfer learning in nonparametric regression using a centered
random forest (CRF) with distance covariance-based feature weights, assuming
the unknown source and target regression functions are different for a few
features (sparsely different). Our method first obtains residuals from
predicting the response in the target domain using a source domain-trained CRF.
Then, we fit another CRF to the residuals, but with feature splitting
probabilities proportional to the sample distance covariance between the
features and the residuals in an independent sample. We derive an upper bound
on the mean square error rate of the procedure as a function of sample sizes
and difference dimension, theoretically demonstrating transfer learning
benefits in random forests. In simulations, we show that the results obtained
for the CRFs also hold numerically for the standard random forest (SRF) method
with data-driven feature split selection. Beyond transfer learning, our results
also show the benefit of distance-covariance-based weights on the performance
of RF in some situations. Our method shows significant gains in predicting the
mortality of ICU patients in smaller-bed target hospitals using a large
multi-hospital dataset of electronic health records for 200,000 ICU patients.

Conclusion: 本文提供了ICL的统一理论视角：Transformer通过预训练学习选择最优元算法，并在测试时仅需少量上下文示例就能快速收敛到真实任务的最优算法。

Abstract: This paper develops a finite-sample statistical theory for in-context
learning (ICL), analyzed within a meta-learning framework that accommodates
mixtures of diverse task types. We introduce a principled risk decomposition
that separates the total ICL risk into two orthogonal components: Bayes Gap and
Posterior Variance. The Bayes Gap quantifies how well the trained model
approximates the Bayes-optimal in-context predictor. For a uniform-attention
Transformer, we derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on this gap, which
explicitly clarifies the dependence on the number of pretraining prompts and
their context length. The Posterior Variance is a model-independent risk
representing the intrinsic task uncertainty. Our key finding is that this term
is determined solely by the difficulty of the true underlying task, while the
uncertainty arising from the task mixture vanishes exponentially fast with only
a few in-context examples. Together, these results provide a unified view of
ICL: the Transformer selects the optimal meta-algorithm during pretraining and
rapidly converges to the optimal algorithm for the true task at test time.

Conclusion: 该研究为端到端学习延迟系统提供了首个全面的对抗鲁棒性分析框架，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables hybrid decision-making by routing inputs
either to a predictor or to external experts. While promising, L2D is highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which can not only flip predictions
but also manipulate deferral decisions. Prior robustness analyses focus solely
on two-stage settings, leaving open the end-to-end (one-stage) case where
predictor and allocation are trained jointly. We introduce the first framework
for adversarial robustness in one-stage L2D, covering both classification and
regression. Our approach formalizes attacks, proposes cost-sensitive
adversarial surrogate losses, and establishes theoretical guarantees including
$\mathcal{H}$, $(\mathcal{R }, \mathcal{F})$, and Bayes consistency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that our methods improve robustness
against untargeted and targeted attacks while preserving clean performance.

Motivation: 传统的风险度量在表达期望损失时往往无法充分捕捉数据中不同子组之间的不平衡问题。

Method: 引入约束f-熵风险度量家族，通过f-散度实现对分布偏移和子组不平衡的精细控制；推导了经典和分解的PAC-Bayesian泛化边界；设计了自约束算法直接最小化边界。

Result: 为约束f-熵风险度量家族提供了首个超出标准风险的分解PAC-Bayesian保证；开发了在子组级别具有保证的模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理子组不平衡问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: PAC generalization bounds on the risk, when expressed in terms of the
expected loss, are often insufficient to capture imbalances between subgroups
in the data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new family of risk
measures, called constrained f-entropic risk measures, which enable finer
control over distributional shifts and subgroup imbalances via f-divergences,
and include the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), a well-known risk measure. We
derive both classical and disintegrated PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for
this family of risks, providing the first disintegratedPAC-Bayesian guarantees
beyond standard risks. Building on this theory, we design a self-bounding
algorithm that minimizes our bounds directly, yielding models with guarantees
at the subgroup level. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the usefulness of
our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Wilcoxon秩得分的组lasso正则化秩回归方法，用于处理高维回归中的重尾噪声和异常值问题，并开发了高效的优化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维回归经常受到重尾噪声和异常值的影响，这会严重削弱基于最小二乘法方法的可靠性。为了提升鲁棒性，需要开发能够抵抗异常值的稳健回归方法。

Method: 采用非光滑Wilcoxon秩得分目标函数，结合结构化组稀疏正则化（组lasso的推广），提出了组lasso正则化秩回归方法。开发了基于数据驱动的调参规则和近端增广拉格朗日优化算法。

Result: 建立了所得估计量的有限样本误差界，数值实验表明所提估计量在鲁棒性和有效性方面优于替代方法，算法在模拟和真实数据场景中均展现出良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了高维回归中的鲁棒性问题，通过秩回归和组稀疏正则化的结合，以及高效的优化算法，为处理重尾噪声和异常值提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional regression often suffers from heavy-tailed noise and
outliers, which can severely undermine the reliability of least-squares based
methods. To improve robustness, we adopt a non-smooth Wilcoxon score based rank
objective and incorporate structured group sparsity regularization, a natural
generalization of the lasso, yielding a group lasso regularized rank regression
method. By extending the tuning-free parameter selection scheme originally
developed for the lasso, we introduce a data-driven, simulation-based tuning
rule and further establish a finite-sample error bound for the resulting
estimator. On the computational side, we develop a proximal augmented
Lagrangian method for solving the associated optimization problem, which
eliminates the singularity issues encountered in existing methods, thereby
enabling efficient semismooth Newton updates for the subproblems. Extensive
numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our
proposed estimator against alternatives, and showcase the scalability of the
algorithm across both simulated and real-data settings.

### [244] [Toxicity Bounds for Dynamic Liquidation Incentives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10171)
*Alexander McFarlane*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: 本文推导了在恒定乘积自动做市商(CP-AMM)上进行链上清算时的滑点感知毒性条件，提出了考虑流动性惩罚因子的毒性边界收紧条件，并分析了动态清算激励对螺旋风险的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在CP-AMM上进行链上清算时，如何考虑滑点影响来改进毒性条件，并探讨动态清算激励对螺旋风险的影响机制。

Method: 推导了考虑流动性惩罚因子λ的毒性边界条件，分析了固定清算激励和动态健康相关清算激励两种情况下的毒性条件。

Result: 对于固定清算激励i，毒性边界从ν < 1/(1+i)收紧为ν < 1/((1+i)λ)；对于动态清算激励i(h)=i(1-h)，在清算边界得到仅依赖流动性深度的条件ν < 1/λ。

Conclusion: 该研究阐明了动态清算激励在减少还是加剧螺旋风险方面的作用，为CP-AMM清算机制设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We derive a slippage-aware toxicity condition for on-chain liquidations
executed via a constant-product automated market maker (CP-AMM). For a fixed
(constant) liquidation incentive $i$, the familiar toxicity frontier $\nu <
1/(1+i)$ tightens to $\nu < 1/((1+i)\lambda)$ for a liquidity penalty factor
$\lambda$ that we derive for both the CP-AMM and a generalised form. Using a
dynamic health-linked liquidation incentive $i(h) = i(1 - h)$, we obtain a
state-dependent bound and, at the liquidation boundary, a liquidity-depth-only
condition $\nu < 1/\lambda$. This reconciles dynamic incentives with the impact
of the CP-AMM price and clarifies when dynamic liquidation incentives reduce
versus exacerbate spiral risk.

### [245] [A Risk Mitigation Model of Monetary Ecosystem with Stablecoins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10469)
*Hongzhe Wen,R. S. M. Lau*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: 提出一种混合货币架构，将法币支持的稳定币嵌入央行锚定框架，通过100%准备金、互操作性赎回通道和常备流动性设施来结构性地缓解流动性风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稳定币已成为全球金融基础设施的重要组成部分，但其在支付和结算系统中的日益整合引入了新的系统性风险渠道，特别是在市场压力时期的流动性风险。

Method: 开发混合货币架构，结合100%准备金支持、互操作性赎回通道和常备流动性设施，保证按面值即时可兑换性。使用2023年SVB USDC脱锚事件作为校准压力情景进行验证。

Result: 该架构减少了峰值脱锚偏差，缩短了压力持续时间，并在高赎回强度下稳定了赎回队列。通过整合流动性保障和消除期限转换渠道，事前解决挤兑动态。

Conclusion: 研究结果为混合稳定币-CBDC架构提供了实证和理论支持，这种架构能增强系统韧性、保持货币完整性，并为稳定币整合到受监管金融系统建立可信路径。

Abstract: Stablecoins have emerged as a significant component of global financial
infrastructure, with aggregate market capitalization surpassing USD250 billion
in 2025. Their increasing integration into payment and settlement systems has
simultaneously introduced novel channels of systemic exposure, particularly
liquidity risk during periods of market stress. This study develops a hybrid
monetary architecture that embeds fiat-backed stablecoins within a central
bank-anchored framework to structurally mitigate liquidity fragility. The
proposed model combines 100 percent reserve backing, interoperable redemption
rails, and standing liquidity facilities to guarantee instant convertibility at
par. Using the 2023 SVB USDC de-peg event as a calibrated stress scenario, we
demonstrate that this architecture reduces peak peg deviations, shortens stress
persistence, and stabilizes redemption queues under high redemption intensity.
By integrating liquidity backstops and eliminating maturity-transformation
channels, the framework addresses run dynamics ex ante rather than through ad
hoc intervention. These findings provide empirical and theoretical support for
a hybrid stablecoin-CBDC architecture that enhances systemic resilience,
preserves monetary integrity, and establishes a credible pathway for stablecoin
integration into regulated financial systems.

### [246] [Learning the Exact SABR Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10343)
*Giorgia Rensi,Pietro Rossi,Marco Bianchetti*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: 开发了一种专门的深度神经网络架构SABR DNN，通过大规模训练数据集学习真实的SABR随机动态，解决了传统Hagan近似在高波动率、长期限和价外期权情况下的精度问题，实现了无套利的市场波动率曲面校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SABR模型的Hagan近似在高波动率、长期限和价外期权情况下精度下降，存在套利机会。现有机器学习方法受限于简化的SABR动态或缺乏系统验证。

Method: 使用超过2亿个点的利率上限/下限波动率曲面大规模训练数据集，通过高精度无偏蒙特卡洛模拟特殊缩放移位SABR随机动态，构建专门的深度神经网络架构。

Result: SABR DNN能够以可忽略的计算成本对任何期限和执行价的市场波动率曲面和上限/下限价格进行无套利校准，且无需跨业务日期重新训练。

Conclusion: 该研究系统性地解决了先前机器学习SABR文献中的空白，建立了全面的函数SABR框架，可扩展到不同利率期限和货币的任何利率欧式期权，适用于日常交易和风险管理。

Abstract: The SABR model is a cornerstone of interest rate volatility modeling, but its
practical application relies heavily on the analytical approximation by Hagan
et al., whose accuracy deteriorates for high volatility, long maturities, and
out-of-the-money options, admitting arbitrage. While machine learning
approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, they have often
been limited by simplified SABR dynamics or a lack of systematic validation
against the full spectrum of market conditions.
  We develop a novel SABR DNN, a specialized Artificial Deep Neural Network
(DNN) architecture that learns the true SABR stochastic dynamics using an
unprecedented large training dataset (more than 200 million points) of interest
rate Cap/Floor volatility surfaces, including very long maturities (30Y) and
extreme strikes consistently with market quotations. Our dataset is obtained
via high-precision unbiased Monte Carlo simulation of a special scaled
shifted-SABR stochastic dynamics, which allows dimensional reduction without
any loss of generality.
  Our SABR DNN provides arbitrage-free calibration of real market volatility
surfaces and Caps/Floors prices for any maturity and strike with negligible
computational effort and without retraining across business dates. Our results
fully address the gaps in the previous machine learning SABR literature in a
systematic and self-consistent way, and can be extended to cover any interest
rate European options in different rate tenors and currencies, thus
establishing a comprehensive functional SABR framework that can be adopted for
daily trading and risk management activities.

Method: 使用FinGPT进行情感分析，采用TD3强化学习算法整合情感和技术信号，并与传统基于规则的方法进行对比。

Result: FinGPT生成的情感信号与传统技术指标结合具有价值，强化学习在动态交易环境中能有效整合异质信号。

Conclusion: 情感分析为量化交易提供有价值的信息，强化学习是整合异质信号的有前景方法。

Abstract: This research develops a sentiment-driven quantitative trading system that
leverages a large language model, FinGPT, for sentiment analysis, and explores
a novel method for signal integration using a reinforcement learning algorithm,
Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3). We compare the
performance of strategies that integrate sentiment and technical signals using
both a conventional rule-based approach and a reinforcement learning framework.
The results suggest that sentiment signals generated by FinGPT offer value when
combined with traditional technical indicators, and that reinforcement learning
algorithm presents a promising approach for effectively integrating
heterogeneous signals in dynamic trading environments.

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: 提出HLPPL模型用于量化检测金融泡沫，结合LPPL模型、情感评分和炒作指数，通过双流transformer训练生成泡沫评分，在2018-2024年美股回测中实现34.13%年化收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融泡沫的量化检测问题，为学术界和从业人员提供有效的泡沫识别工具。

Method: 使用LPPL模型、情感评分和炒作指数生成泡沫标签，采用双流transformer模型结合市场数据和机器学习方法训练，生成泡沫置信度评分。

Result: 在2018-2024年美股回测中实现34.13%年化收益率，模型在不同行业表现出良好的泛化能力，对泡沫期的保守预测减少了误报。

Conclusion: HLPPL方法结合理论和实证进展，能够实时识别和测量正负泡沫，为市场信号和决策提供有益工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel model, the Hyped Log-Periodic Power Law Model (HLPPL), to
the problem of quantifying and detecting financial bubbles, an ever-fascinating
one for academics and practitioners alike. Bubble labels are generated using a
Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, sentiment scores, and a hype index we
introduced in previous research on NLP forecasting of stock return volatility.
Using these tools, a dual-stream transformer model is trained with market data
and machine learning methods, resulting in a time series of confidence scores
as a Bubble Score. A distinctive feature of our framework is that it captures
phases of extreme overpricing and underpricing within a unified structure.
  We achieve an average yield of 34.13 percentage annualized return when
backtesting U.S. equities during the period 2018 to 2024, while the approach
exhibits a remarkable generalization ability across industry sectors. Its
conservative bias in predicting bubble periods minimizes false positives, a
feature which is especially beneficial for market signaling and
decision-making. Overall, this approach utilizes both theoretical and empirical
advances for real-time positive and negative bubble identification and
measurement with HLPPL signals.

TL;DR: 提出几何框架将LLM推理建模为表示空间中的流，通过分离逻辑结构和语义来研究LLM是否内化了逻辑而不仅仅是表面形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何在表示空间中"思考"，探索其是否真正内化了逻辑推理能力。

Method: 使用几何框架将推理建模为嵌入轨迹流，通过自然演绎命题分离逻辑和语义，用表示代理设计受控实验来可视化和量化推理流。

Result: 理论证明LLM推理对应表示空间中的平滑流，逻辑语句作为这些流速的局部控制器，实验验证了理论框架。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究推理现象提供了概念基础和实践工具，为LLM行为可解释性和形式分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了PULSE框架，用于更高效地评估人类与AI代理的交互，通过收集用户反馈、训练满意度预测模型和结合人工评分与模型伪标签来计算结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试大多假设完全自动化，未能反映真实世界中人机协作的本质，需要更严谨的人类-代理交互评估方法。

Method: 开发PULSE评估框架，包含用户反馈收集、满意度预测模型训练、人工评分与模型伪标签结合；在开源软件代理OpenHands平台上部署，收集超过15,000用户的使用数据。

Result: 框架使代理设计决策的置信区间比标准A/B测试减少40%；发现实际使用结果与基准测试性能存在显著差异（如claude-sonnet-4与gpt-5比较结果呈负相关）。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM代理的人类评估提供指导，识别了更好的代理设计机会，强调了基准驱动评估的局限性。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

Method: 通过分析十种可能构成意识本质的特征，批判性地审视各种意识理论（如全局工作空间理论、高阶理论、整合信息理论等）在AI意识问题上的适用性。

Result: 发现不同主流意识理论对AI是否具有意识给出相互矛盾的结论，我们无法确定AI是否具有真正的主观体验，也无法通过现有论证解决这一认知困境。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的地球观测驱动的空间表示主要编码物理和光谱模式，缺乏捕捉城市功能和社会经济维度的人类活动信息。

Method: 通过多模态对齐将AlphaEarth嵌入与POI文本表示对齐，在预训练的AE基础上进行轻量级语义增强。

Result: 在伦敦地区，AETHER相比AE基线在土地利用分类F1得分上相对提升7.2%，在社会经济映射的KL散度上相对减少23.6%。

Conclusion: AETHER通过耦合地球观测与人类中心语义，推进地理空间基础模型向整合物理形态和功能意义的通用城市表示发展。

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

Abstract: Computing has long served as a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Recently,
a paradigm shift has emerged with the rise of large language models (LLMs),
introducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate
discovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a

scientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This
paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their
growing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from
hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and
refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key
innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally,
we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for
building more robust, generalizable, and adaptive scientific agents. Our
analysis highlights the transformative potential of autonomous agents to
accelerate scientific discovery across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 研究发现，当AI系统整合用户长期记忆时，不同的用户档案会导致系统性的情感理解偏差，优势群体获得更准确的情感解读，这可能导致AI个性化机制强化社会不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化AI系统越来越多地整合长期用户记忆，理解这种记忆如何影响情感推理变得至关重要，特别是要探究用户记忆对大型语言模型情感智能的影响。

Method: 通过评估15个大型语言模型在人类验证的情感智能测试上的表现，比较相同情境下不同用户档案的情感解读差异。

Result: 研究发现，相同的场景搭配不同的用户档案会产生系统性的情感理解分歧，多个高性能LLM存在系统性偏见，优势群体获得更准确的情感解读，且在情感理解和支持性建议任务中存在显著的人口统计学差异。

Conclusion: 记忆增强型AI面临关键挑战：为个性化设计的系统可能无意中强化社会不平等，需要关注个性化机制如何将社会等级嵌入模型的情感推理中。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在关键推理缺陷，包括产生幻觉和在逻辑谬误分类中准确性差。这些限制源于其默认的快速直觉式系统1处理，而可靠推理需要深思熟虑的系统2方法。

Method: 引入新颖的逐步指令数据集，将谬误分类分解为一系列原子程序步骤（简单二元问题），并通过咨询相关谬误的关系知识图谱进行最终验证。

Result: 这种基于程序的规则干预显著提高了LLM逻辑谬误分类的性能，并为LLM决策过程提供了更强的透明度。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号架构解决LLM推理缺陷提供了一条实用途径，展示了低成本干预在提升模型推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过多轮LLM辩论分析大型语言模型在道德推理中的价值对齐，发现在同步和轮询辩论格式下，GPT、Claude和Gemini在道德判断修订、价值优先性和从众行为方面存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在敏感日常场景中的部署增加，需要理解其在复杂道德推理中的价值对齐。现有研究多关注单轮提示，但多轮对话中的价值形成机制尚不明确。

Method: 使用三个模型（GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Gemini 2.0 Flash）在Reddit的"Am I the Asshole"社区的1000个日常困境中进行集体归责辩论，采用同步和轮询两种格式测试顺序效应和判断修订。

Result: GPT表现出强惯性（修订率0.6-3.1%），Claude和Gemini更灵活（28-41%）。GPT强调个人自主性和直接沟通，Claude和Gemini优先考虑共情对话。辩论格式对模型行为有强烈影响，GPT和Gemini表现出高从众性。

Conclusion: 多轮互动中的道德推理受到辩论格式和模型特定行为的强烈影响，表明社会技术对齐不仅取决于系统输出，还取决于对话结构方式。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to

TL;DR: 提出了RIPRAG攻击框架，一种针对检索增强生成系统的黑盒投毒攻击方法，使用强化学习优化投毒文档生成，显著提升了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要针对简化RAG架构的白盒攻击，缺乏对复杂真实场景下黑盒攻击的研究。攻击者通常不了解RAG系统内部组成，且系统包含检索器之外的多个组件。

Method: 提出RIPRAG攻击框架，将目标RAG系统视为黑盒，仅利用攻击是否成功的信息，使用强化学习优化投毒文档生成模型，确保生成的投毒文档符合目标RAG系统的偏好。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能有效对大多数复杂RAG系统执行投毒攻击，相比基线方法攻击成功率提升高达0.72。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前防御方法的普遍缺陷，为LLM安全研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Qinglin Zeng,Ningyuan Liu,Stephen Fan,Ziliang Chen,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CE-Graph框架，将LLM工作流优化重新定义为分布问题，通过最小化期望失败质量来直接优化失败分布，而非最大化标量分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将多步骤执行轨迹简化为成功/失败信号，导致信息坍塌，无法建模工作流的失败分布结构

Method: 引入失败签名空间(FSS)，通过反例池近似失败分布，识别密集区域作为重复失败模式，使用提议-验证机制进行针对性图编辑

Result: 在数学、代码和QA基准测试中，CE-Graph以显著更低的成本实现了更高的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 系统可靠性源于系统性地学习和重塑其失败分布的几何结构，而非避免失败

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个图论框架，将可信度与置信度分离，通过收缩传播过程计算置信度，定义推理区域作为高置信度、结构平衡的子图，并引入冲击更新来建模信念变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信念系统通常存在全局不一致性，但局部推理仍然有效。需要一种能够容忍矛盾、在结构支持的地方激活经典逻辑的推理框架。

Method: 使用有向、带符号、加权的图表示信念，节点为信念，边编码支持和矛盾关系。通过收缩传播过程计算置信度，定义推理区域为高置信度、结构平衡的子图，并提供近线性算法构建区域图谱。引入冲击更新来建模信念变化。

Result: 在合成带符号图中进行了实验，报告了区域恢复、冲击下的稳定性以及运行时间。

Conclusion: 为容忍矛盾的推理提供了原则性基础，在结构支持的地方精确激活经典逻辑。

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

Motivation: 现有多智能体框架依赖固定角色或集中控制，限制了长时程推理的可扩展性和适应性。

Method: 集成自适应智能体和事件档案、基于嵌入的概率匹配以及信息素启发的强化机制，支持动态任务分配。

Result: 在符号推理、研究综合和科学编程任务中，SwarmSys始终优于基线方法，提高了准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 群体启发的协调是推进LLM智能的有前景范式，协调扩展可能与模型扩展同等重要。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

TL;DR: SyncLipMAE是一个自监督预训练框架，通过掩码视觉建模和跨模态对比对齐，从无标签音视频流中学习同步感知和可迁移的面部动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决说话人脸视频中需要学习同步感知的面部动态表示，并实现跨多种下游任务的统一接口。

Method: 结合掩码视觉建模与跨模态对比对齐，使用三个逐帧提示令牌编码身份、语音同步面部动态和音频无关运动，通过对比学习将两种模态映射到共享嵌入空间。

Result: 在四个需要不同能力的任务家族中实现了最先进的结果，包括音视频流同步、面部表情识别、视觉语音识别和视觉配音。

Conclusion: 同步感知、分解的自监督预训练在说话人脸视频分析中非常有效，能够为多种下游任务提供统一的控制接口。

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

TL;DR: StepFly是一个端到端的自动化故障排除指南框架，通过三阶段工作流解决TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解析、数据密集型查询和执行并行化等关键挑战，在真实TSG上实现约94%的成功率，显著减少执行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模IT系统中的故障管理依赖故障排除指南(TSG)，但手动执行缓慢且易出错。现有基于LLM的解决方案缺乏对TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解析、数据密集型查询和执行并行化等关键挑战的专业支持。

Method: StepFly采用三阶段工作流：1) TSG Mentor工具帮助SRE改进TSG质量；2) 离线预处理使用LLM从非结构化TSG中提取结构化执行DAG并创建专用查询准备插件(QPPs)；3) 在线执行使用DAG引导的调度器-执行器框架，支持并行执行独立步骤。

Result: 在真实TSG和事件上的评估显示，StepFly在GPT-4.1上达到约94%的成功率，优于基线方法，同时减少时间和token消耗。对于可并行化的TSG，执行时间减少了32.9%到70.4%。

Conclusion: StepFly通过其创新的三阶段框架有效解决了TSG自动化的关键挑战，显著提高了故障排除的效率和成功率，为大规模IT系统的自动化故障管理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

TL;DR: 提出了DixitWorld评估套件，包含DixitArena多智能体环境和DixitBench静态基准，用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态溯因推理能力，发现模型在生成创造性和判别理解之间存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对视觉语言模型多模态溯因推理能力的评估主要局限于静态、单智能体任务，需要更全面的评估框架来解构这一挑战。

Method: 设计DixitWorld评估套件，包含：1) DixitArena - 动态多智能体环境，评估假设生成（讲故事者）和假设选择（听众）；2) DixitBench - 静态问答基准，隔离听众任务进行控制评估。

Result: 较小开源模型作为讲故事者表现更好，产生更具想象力但区分度较低的线索；较大专有模型整体表现更优，特别是在作为听众时。DixitBench结果与DixitArena听众表现强相关。

Conclusion: 多模态溯因推理中存在生成创造性和判别理解之间的关键权衡，这是开发更平衡、能力更强的视觉语言代理的核心挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

Result: 在多场景叙事实验中显著提升角色保真度、语义对齐和时间一致性，在拥挤场景中保持鲁棒性，支持可扩展的多角色生成

Conclusion: CharCom适用于故事插图和动画等实际应用，具有最小开销的可扩展多角色生成能力

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and
animation.

visual elements and another LLM translates this description into executable
Manim Python code. We discuss its potential as an educational tool for rapidly
creating engaging visual explanations for complex STEM topics, democratizing
the creation of high-quality educational content.

TL;DR: 提出了PALU方法，通过性能感知的长度更新来解决大语言模型中的简洁推理问题，在减少65%输出长度的同时提高15%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有简洁推理方法依赖手工设计的启发式规则，难以平衡简洁性与性能，且无法跨领域和模型规模适配

Method: 将简洁推理建模为约束优化问题，使用拉格朗日优化转化为无约束问题，并通过三个近似简化更新规则：离策略性能估计、二元拉格朗日乘子、分位数驱动的长度调整

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上，平均减少65%输出长度同时提高15%准确率，在五个基准测试中优于其他方法

Conclusion: PALU是一种实用有效的简洁推理方法，能够跨领域（逻辑、STEM、数学）和模型规模（1.5B、7B、14B）自适应

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

TL;DR: 提出SAFER框架，通过两阶段风险控制解决开放域问答中无法获得所有可能答案的问题，提供统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性共形预测方法假设所有实例的可接受答案都能通过有限采样获得，这在开放域问答中不现实，需要新的风险控制方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 基于Clopper-Pearson方法校准采样预算；2) 应用共形风险控制方法确定不确定性阈值，过滤不可靠候选答案。

Result: SAFER框架能够控制正确答案被排除的风险，兼容各种任务特定的准入标准和校准-测试分割比例。

Conclusion: SAFER为开放域问答提供了统计上有效的风险控制方法，具有鲁棒性和高数据效率。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 解决LLM智能体在复杂多轮工具使用任务中面临的高质量训练数据稀缺问题，以及SFT方法容易过拟合、标准RL方法存在冷启动和训练不稳定的挑战。

Method: Environment Tuning范式：1）结构化课程编排学习过程；2）可操作的环境增强提供纠正反馈；3）细粒度进度奖励确保稳定高效探索。仅使用400个BFCL基准问题实例进行训练。

Result: 在分布内性能与强基线竞争，在分布外泛化方面表现更优，克服了SFT方法常见的性能崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 实现了从基于静态轨迹的监督微调到动态环境探索的范式转变，为训练更鲁棒和数据高效的智能体开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

<details>

Motivation: 现有激活引导方法依赖粗粒度启发式，缺乏对引导位置和干预强度的原则性考虑，需要更可靠的行为控制方法来部署LLM。

Method: 使用双视角（尾平均和末端标记）学习属性对齐子空间，通过约束几何目标选择干预强度，进行样本级正交残差校准和轻量级位置扫描。

Result: 在不同模型和评估范式下，PIXEL持续改善属性对齐，同时保持模型通用能力。

Conclusion: PIXEL为LLM的可控生成提供了实用且原则性的方法，具有表示级的最小干预保证。

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on

limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

TL;DR: 本文提出"包容性创新红利"概念，认为为多样化、受限使用场景设计的医疗AI解决方案能在更广泛市场产生更优经济回报，并开发了HAIIF评分系统来评估AI投资的包容性价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然医疗AI公平性的伦理论证已很成熟，但包容性设计的经济和战略价值仍未充分探索。本文旨在揭示包容性创新如何创造超越合规要求的商业价值。

Method: 通过分析从辅助技术演变为主流产业的案例，识别包容性创新驱动回报的四个机制，并开发了医疗AI包容性创新框架(HAIIF)作为实践评分系统。

Result: 研究发现包容性设计能通过市场扩张、风险缓解、性能红利和竞争优势四个机制创造显著经济价值。HAIIF框架为组织提供了评估AI投资包容性潜力的结构化工具。

Conclusion: 渐进投资包容性设计的组织能实现市场扩张和持续竞争优势，而将包容性视为成本的组织将面临网络效应和数据优势积累带来的复合劣势。

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

Motivation: 受人类大脑中少数关键神经元对认知功能至关重要的启发，研究探索LLMs是否也存在类似的关键神经元子集。

Method: 提出基于扰动的因果关键神经元识别方法，系统定位LLMs中的关键神经元。

Result: 发现：(1) LLMs包含超稀疏关键神经元，破坏它们可使72B参数模型完全崩溃；(2) 关键神经元集中分布在外层MLP组件；(3) 性能退化呈现急剧相变而非渐进下降。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更鲁棒的模型架构和提高安全关键应用中的部署安全性提供了指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级插件方法，通过识别和调节感知与推理导向的注意力头来减少多模态大推理模型的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试上平均提升5%，最高提升15%，且计算开销极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大推理模型存在幻觉问题，表现为错误的推理链和视觉内容误解。研究发现注意力头存在阶段性分工：浅层负责感知，深层转向符号推理，揭示了感知偏差和推理漂移是幻觉的两大原因。

Method: 提出两步插件方法：功能头识别和类条件重缩放。首先定位感知和推理导向的注意力头，然后在不重新训练的情况下调节它们的贡献度。

Result: 在三个真实世界MLRM模型、六个跨三个领域的基准测试和四个基线方法上，该插件平均提升5%，最高提升15%，仅增加<1%的计算开销和9%的基线延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法完全模型无关，显著提升了现成MLRM的可靠性和可解释性，使其能够安全部署在高风险应用中。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

Abstract: We propose a practical approach by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)

Additionally, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy to create

fine-tuning of our model. Our internal experiments (not applied to Airbnb
products) demonstrate that our approach of restructuring workflows and
fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data significantly enhances their performance,
setting a new benchmark for their application in customer support. Our solution
is not only cost-effective but also improves customer support, as evidenced by
both accuracy and manual processing time evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 解决LLM幻觉问题，提升模型部署可靠性，需要有效的置信度估计方法。

Method: 通过多模型、多数据集、多提示的综合实验，分析推理轨迹长度与准确率的关系，并研究其机制。

Result: 推理轨迹长度作为置信度估计器表现良好，即使调整了问题难度和GRPO诱导的长度偏差后仍然有效。高熵或"分叉"token在机制中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 推理后训练增强了不确定性量化能力，轨迹长度可作为大型推理模型的实用置信度度量。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在建模患者轨迹方面具有通用性，但电子健康记录数据的长序列和噪声特性给时序推理带来挑战，需要解决这些问题以提高预测准确性。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，包括工作智能体链顺序处理EHR数据块，将关键事件提取到共享长期记忆模块EHRMem中，最后由管理智能体综合总结和时间线进行预测。

Result: 在基于五年EHR数据的零样本一年肺癌风险预测任务中，Traj-CoA在四类基线方法中表现最优，分析显示其具有临床对齐的时序推理能力。

Conclusion: Traj-CoA为建模复杂患者轨迹提供了一个鲁棒且可推广的方法，在临床时序推理方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling
patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic
health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

Conclusion: 协作方法在不同医疗领域泛化良好，为现实医疗场景提供了可解释的决策路径，将孤立范式转变为协作范式

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical
scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

TL;DR: 提出Latent-Trajectory信号来预测推理过程成功率，通过分析模型内部表征的时间演化，显著提高推理效率并减少计算浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型通过增加计算资源来提升问题解决能力，但识别哪些推理路径可能成功是关键机会，可靠预测有效路径可大幅减少计算浪费并提高整体效率。

Method: 引入Latent-Trajectory信号，通过测量推理开始和结束时潜在表征的总体变化、中间步骤累积的变化以及这些变化向最终状态推进的程度来预测解决方案准确性。

Result: Latent-Trajectory信号比跨层指标和基于输出的置信度测量更可靠地预测解决方案准确性，在多个采样生成中指导答案选择时，可使测试时扩展比多数投票更有效和高效，减少token使用量达70%，同时平均提高准确性2.6%。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅为推理时效率提供了实用策略，还从可解释性角度深入揭示了推理过程在潜在空间中的表示和区分方式。

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLMs对学术论文的深度理解方面存在不足，要么问题设计肤浅，要么评估指标不可靠，需要更专业的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 通过激励驱动的对抗性标注过程开发ELAIPBench基准，包含137篇论文的403个多选问题，涵盖三个难度级别，强调非平凡推理而非浅层检索。

Result: 最佳性能的LLM准确率仅为39.95%，远低于人类表现。配备思维模式或RAG系统的前沿LLM未能改善结果，甚至因过度思考或噪声检索而降低准确性。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能力与真正理解学术论文之间存在显著差距，需要更深入的研究来提升模型对复杂学术内容的理解能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

Motivation: 随机置换集是表示有序结构不确定信息的新框架，测量置换质量函数之间的距离是RPS理论的关键研究课题。现有方法存在局限性，需要开发更有效的距离度量方法。

Method: 采用RPS的层-2信念结构解释，从置换出发引入累积Jaccard指数来量化两个置换之间的相似性，并基于累积Jaccard指数矩阵提出RPS的距离测量方法。

Result: 提出的方法具有自然的上位权重特性：较高排名元素之间的不一致性会导致更大的距离值。实验结果表明该方法克服了现有方法的缺点，与Jousselme距离兼容，且具有更高的灵敏度和灵活性。

Conclusion: 基于累积Jaccard指数的距离测量方法为随机置换集提供了一种有效的距离度量工具，具有理论合理性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

Result: 通过广泛实验提供了关于进化算法如何有效优化神经网络的关键见解。

Conclusion: 该方法有显著潜力降低大语言模型的训练计算成本，使计算资源有限的群体能够参与深度学习研究。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将大语言模型与数学优化结合的混合框架，用于在线叫车平台的供需平衡问题，无需训练数据，通过LLM生成高层目标指导底层优化器，相比现有方法平均提升16%性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法存在两类问题：强化学习方法数据效率低、对现实动态建模过于简化、难以实施操作约束；分解在线优化方法依赖人工设计的高层目标，缺乏对底层路由动态的认知。

Method: 提出训练免费的混合框架，LLM作为元优化器生成语义启发式规则，指导底层优化器执行约束实施和实时决策，通过和声搜索驱动的闭环进化过程迭代优化LLM提示。

Result: 基于纽约和芝加哥出租车数据集的实验表明，该方法相比最先进基线平均提升16%性能。

Conclusion: LLM与数学优化结合的混合框架能有效解决在线叫车平台的供需平衡问题，无需大规模训练数据，通过自适应生成高层目标弥补问题分解带来的认知局限。

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出UCAS方法，通过利用模型内部不确定性信号来改进强化学习中的信用分配，解决现有方法在推理过程中对关键决策关注不足的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR算法如GRPO在序列中广播统一的优势信号，忽略了推理过程中不确定的高风险决策的关键作用，导致探索效率低下和熵崩溃问题

Method: UCAS采用两阶段机制：首先基于模型整体自信度调制响应级优势，然后基于原始logit确定性应用token级惩罚，鼓励探索高不确定性但正确的路径，惩罚过度自信的错误推理

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试上的广泛实验表明，UCAS在多个模型规模（包括1.5B和7B）上显著优于强RLVR基线，不仅获得更高奖励，还促进更大的推理多样性并成功缓解熵崩溃

Conclusion: UCAS通过不确定性感知的优势塑造有效平衡了探索与利用的权衡，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Conclusion: simpliflow作为优化简单性、控制性和速度的工具，在确定性工作流环境中具有独特定位，能够有效降低智能体系统开发复杂度。

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for
automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for
building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning
curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and
deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python
framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid
development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows
through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture
decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting
ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over
100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,
operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法全面评估音频和视觉模态的协同推理能力，往往忽视其中一个模态或以逻辑不一致的方式整合它们。

Method: 构建包含1000个高质量问答对的大规模基准，每个问题都有逐步推理轨迹，源自628个多样化视频，涵盖13种精心设计的问题类型。

Result: 多个MLLM在OmniVideoBench上的评估显示模型性能与人类推理之间存在显著差距，开源模型明显落后于闭源模型。

Conclusion: OmniVideoBench将公开发布，以促进具有更强和更通用推理能力的MLLM发展，突显了真正音频-视觉推理的内在难度。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理演算基于二元归结，限制了多子句间的推理协同。虽然CSE框架提出了动态多子句推理理论，但其算法实现尚未形式化。

Method: 开发了扩展三角方法(ETM)，在三角几何框架内形式化矛盾分离机制，支持灵活的子句交互和动态协同。

Result: ETM作为多个高性能定理证明器(CSE、CSE-E、CSI-E、CSI-Enig)的核心算法，在标准一阶基准测试中取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: ETM通过桥接理论抽象与操作实现，将矛盾分离范式推进为通用、可扩展且实用的自动推理模型，为逻辑推理和定理证明研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应选择符号语言的方法来改进LLMs的逻辑推理性能，通过为每个问题选择最合适的符号语言形式化方法，显著提高了推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将自然语言问题翻译为符号语言时，只关注翻译的准确性，但忽略了不同符号语言类型本身对推理性能的影响。不同逻辑推理问题对应不同的最优符号语言形式化方法。

Method: 利用LLMs从一阶逻辑、逻辑编程和布尔可满足性三种符号语言中自适应选择最适合当前问题的目标语言，然后将自然语言问题翻译为目标符号语言表达式，并使用相应的逻辑求解器得出最终答案。

Result: 在基准测试上，自适应选择方法显著优于将所有问题翻译为单一符号语言或随机选择符号语言的方法。在混合数据集上达到了96%的准确率，比一阶逻辑翻译的次高准确率提高了25%。

Conclusion: 不同自然语言逻辑推理问题对应不同的最优符号语言形式化方法，自适应选择目标符号语言可以显著提升LLMs的逻辑推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个框架来评估大型语言模型是否具有真正的战略思维能力，发现前沿模型在特定推理深度下表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为，并展现出元推理和新型启发式规则形成的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLMs在均衡博弈或推理深度方面的表现，但缺乏对其真正战略思维能力（即形成对其他智能体信念、评估可能行动并基于信念做出选择的能力）的系统性研究。

Method: 开发了一个框架，在静态完全信息博弈中分离信念、评估和选择，通过分析模型的显性选择和推理轨迹，并引入新的无上下文游戏来排除记忆模仿的影响。

Result: 当前前沿模型在目标推理深度下表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为；在无约束时会自我限制推理深度，并对人类和合成对手形成差异化推测；在复杂性增加时，显式递归让位于内部生成的稳定、模型特定的启发式选择规则。

Conclusion: 信念一致性、元推理和新型启发式形成可以从语言建模目标中共同涌现，为研究人工智能体的战略认知提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

TL;DR: DRIFT框架通过将非正式数学陈述分解为子组件来改进自动形式化，显著提升了前提检索效果和在定理证明中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学陈述自动形式化方面面临挑战，特别是难以识别和利用必要的数学知识及其在Lean等语言中的形式化表示。现有方法直接使用非正式陈述查询外部库，但忽略了非正式数学陈述的复杂性和上下文有限的问题。

Method: 引入DRIFT框架，让LLMs将非正式数学陈述分解为更小的子组件，从而从数学库中更有针对性地检索前提，并检索示例定理以帮助模型更有效地使用前提进行形式化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DRIFT显著提升了前提检索效果，在ProofNet上相比DPR基线F1分数几乎翻倍。在分布外测试集ConNF上，使用GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1分别实现了37.14%和42.25%的BEq+@10改进。

Conclusion: 数学自动形式化中的检索效果高度依赖于模型特定的知识边界，需要与每个模型能力相适应的自适应检索策略。

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

Motivation: 研究具身AI中出现的神经症行为模式，这些行为虽然内部逻辑一致但与现实环境不匹配，影响AI系统的安全性和效率。

Method: 在网格导航系统中识别多种神经症模式，开发轻量级在线检测器和可重用逃脱策略，并使用遗传编程进行破坏性测试来最大化神经症评分。

Result: 识别了12种神经症模式，开发了有效的检测和逃脱机制，并展示了即使在完全可见情况下，习得的厌恶成本仍能导致持久的恐惧回避行为。

Conclusion: 局部修复不足以解决全局故障，需要通过破坏性测试暴露系统架构层面的问题，而不仅仅是症状层面的修补。

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAC协议需要手动配置，而基于深度强化学习的协议虽然能提升网络性能，但泛化性和弹性较差，需要昂贵的重新训练来适应动态环境。

Method: 使用博弈论LLM赋能的MARL框架，将上行链路传输建模为动态多跟随者Stackelberg博弈，采用PPO协调LLM驱动的智能体，通过协议动作语法确保可靠性和效率。

Result: 仿真验证该框架比传统基线吞吐量提升77.6%，公平性提升65.2%，且能很好地泛化到用户数量波动的情况，无需重新训练或架构更改。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了DRL协议泛化性差的问题，实现了自适应语义MAC协议的自动生成，在动态网络环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要局限于单篇论文内的无工具任务，缺乏针对跨论文推理和真实研究场景中多工具协调的评估基准。

Method: 构建了一个模块化、可扩展的平台，提供多模态解析、上下文检索和程序化计算等工具，用于评估代理在回答研究问题时整合多篇论文信息的能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使最先进的LLM驱动的代理系统平均准确率仅为38.78%，在困难子集上准确率更是降至18.47%。所有测试代理都表现出工具使用效率低下的问题。

Conclusion: PaperArena揭示了当前科学发现代理系统的局限性，并邀请研究社区采用该基准来开发更强大的科学发现代理。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业知识分散在Jira、Git、Confluence等异构系统中，传统基于关键词搜索或静态嵌入的方法无法处理需要上下文推理和多跳推理的复杂查询。

Method: 构建统一知识图谱，集成KBLam模型、DeepGraph表示和语义搜索，通过查询分析动态确定最优检索策略，支持结构化和非结构化数据源。

Conclusion: 该框架通过图构建、混合推理和交互式可视化的结合，为企业环境中的智能知识助手提供了可扩展、可解释和以用户为中心的基础。

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

TL;DR: Video-STR是一种基于图强化学习的新型视频时空推理方法，通过GRPO优化策略指导模型推断场景的时空拓扑结构，并在STV-205k数据集上训练，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在语义理解方面表现出色，但在精确的时空理解方面存在不足，特别是忽略了视频中的物理信息（如多物体布局和运动），这限制了在具身智能和VR等高精度应用中的使用。

Method: 提出基于图的强化学习方法Video-STR，采用可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)能力，引入基于图的组相对策略优化(GRPO)推理机制，指导模型在思考过程中推断场景的时空拓扑结构。

Result: 实验表明Video-STR在多个基准测试中取得最先进结果，在STI-Bench上比基础模型提升13%，证明了方法和数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: Video-STR通过图强化学习方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型在精确时空推理方面的局限性，为高精度应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.
Code, model, and data will be released.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法利用设计阶段对目标的理解和知识来支持维护阶段的知识积累和问题解决，有望成为未来整个工程链知识共享的基础。需要开发针对这些维护记录的推断方法、构建用户界面，并在更大更多样化的系统上进行验证。

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

Motivation: AI系统在法律环境中的不透明性（黑箱问题）对公平性、问责制和信任构成挑战，影响了自动化决策的合法性，需要开发符合法律要求的解释方法。

Method: 采用计算论证模型，分析不同解释策略（基于示例、规则、混合和论证的方法）的优势和局限，特别关注与GDPR和AIA等法规的兼容性。

Conclusion: 计算论证方法最能满足法律领域透明度的技术和规范要求，但还需要解决偏见缓解、司法环境实证验证等开放挑战。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation."
Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic
model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the
expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or
even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based
analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system
transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as
quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,
financial, and societal fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学数据的快速增长导致分析能力与研究意图之间存在差距，现有AI分析工具要么偏向自动化而缺乏透明度，要么依赖手动脚本阻碍可扩展性和可复现性。

Method: ARIA采用六层互操作架构（命令、上下文、代码、数据、编排和AI模块），在文档中心化工作流中统一人类推理和机器执行，通过自然语言规范驱动自动化分析。

Result: 在波士顿房价案例中，ARIA发现了25个关键特征并确定XGBoost为最佳模型（R平方=0.93），过拟合最小。跨领域评估显示ARIA在性能、可解释性和效率方面优于最先进系统。

Conclusion: ARIA通过将AI研究和AI科学原则结合在规范驱动架构中，为透明、协作和可复现的科学发现建立了新范式。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能体在规划问题时需要通过如何执行任务的问题来减少不确定性和填补知识空白，但这类开放性问题对AI智能体提问和专家回答都构成挑战，难以支持高效规划。

Method: 引入How2记忆智能体框架，让智能体能够提问、存储答案并在交互环境中重复使用进行终身学习。在Minecraft制作环境中评估，使用不同抽象层次的教师模型回答问题。

Result: 终身学习智能体从抽象且与当前状态解耦的答案中获益最大，这些答案范围从可执行动作序列到高级子目标描述。

Conclusion: How2为基于LLM的智能体提供了一种通过在交互环境中提问来随时间提升规划能力的方法。

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

Conclusion: CDRA通过结构化推理过程有效解决了LLM个性化对齐中的深度偏好推断和防御性推理挑战，提供了可解释的对齐方法。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

Motivation: AI对齐技术都存在故障模式，防御深度策略通过多重冗余保护来缓解风险，但其有效性取决于不同技术故障模式的相关性程度。

Method: 分析7种代表性对齐技术和7种故障模式，评估它们之间的重叠程度和相关性。

Result: 研究发现不同对齐技术的故障模式存在不同程度的重叠，这影响了防御深度策略的实际效果。

Conclusion: 需要更深入地理解对齐技术故障模式的相关性，以优化防御深度策略并指导未来AI安全研究的优先级设置。

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能代理从自然语言指令（如食谱、科学协议）执行长期任务时，由于语言多变性和缺乏结构导致的漂移或失败问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：Teach阶段将程序文本结构化并丰富可执行逻辑，Execute阶段根据实时输入和环境反馈进行动态执行。使用图结构捕获任务依赖关系、决策点和可重用子程序。

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld等四个基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明基于图的程序表示能提供强大的中间抽象层。

Conclusion: 图结构表示减少了长期推理中的错误累积，结构化程序建模对于可靠代理驱动的自动化至关重要。

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

*Beining Wang,Weihang Su,Hongtao Tian,Tao Yang,Yujia Zhou,Ting Yao,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了维度级奖励模型(DRM)，通过置信度、相关性和连贯性三个维度来评估推理过程质量，解决了传统结果监督强化学习的稀疏奖励问题，提升了LLMs的多步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的结果监督强化学习(RLVR)只奖励最终正确答案，容易传播错误推理且奖励信号稀疏；过程级奖励模型(PRMs)虽然提供更密集的反馈，但缺乏泛化性和可解释性，需要任务特定的推理过程分割。

Method: 提出维度级奖励模型(DRM)，从三个基础、互补且可解释的维度评估推理过程质量：置信度（不确定性校准）、相关性（语义对齐）和连贯性（逻辑一致性）。这些维度能够捕捉超越最终答案正确性的方面，且无需真实答案即可进行可解释的评估。

Result: 实验结果表明DRM提供了有效的监督信号，指导LLMs的优化并增强其推理能力。DRM监督训练在数学、问答、代码执行和谜题等开放域任务上，在分布内和分布外都取得了一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究发现对推理过程进行多维监督可以提升LLMs在训练分布之外的泛化推理能力，证明了多维监督框架的有效性。

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DARK是一个统一框架，用于知识图谱中的演绎和溯因推理，通过掩码扩散模型捕获查询与结论的双向关系，在两种推理任务上均取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将演绎推理（从查询检索实体）和溯因推理（从观察生成假设）分开处理，但它们具有明显的协同潜力，需要统一框架来结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出DARK框架：1）自反去噪过程，在溯因推理中迭代生成和验证候选假设；2）逻辑探索强化学习方法，同时掩码查询和结论以探索新颖推理组合。

Result: 在多个基准知识图谱上的广泛实验表明，DARK在演绎和溯因推理任务上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 统一演绎和溯因推理的方法具有显著优势，DARK框架成功展示了这种协同效应，为知识图谱推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private
data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants
across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing
zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI
and Anthropic and Meta. In this work, we explore zero data retention policies
for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution
is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such
systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of
commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data
retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models
service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CC-Gen基准生成器和CAP-CPT方法，用于解决LLM智能体系统中策略文档内部化问题，通过可控复杂度评估和针对性预训练提升策略理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体系统中的策略文档随需求增长而快速扩展，导致高计算开销，需要开发将策略文档嵌入模型先验的内部化方法。

Method: 引入CC-Gen基准生成器，提供四个可控复杂度级别；提出CAP-CPT方法，通过解析策略文档、分类关键规范，指导针对性数据合成和自回归预训练。

Result: CAP-CPT在所有设置下都优于SFT基线，在Qwen-3-32B上提升达41%和22%，在CC-Gen上实现97.3%的提示长度减少，并在少量SFT数据下增强tau-Bench性能。

Conclusion: CAP-CPT方法有效减轻了数据和推理负担，显著提升了策略内部化性能，特别是在处理复杂策略规范时表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张AI研究应采用更严格的可重复性指南，以帮助治理工作并改善对AI风险格局的共识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI政策制定者面临信息环境中信号噪声比过低的问题，这有利于监管捕获，并导致在应优先考虑哪些风险方面存在深度不确定性和分歧。

Method: 通过借鉴其他科学领域的可重复性危机经验，评估AI研究中即将出现的可重复性危机，并评论采用预注册、增加统计能力和负面结果发布等可重复性协议如何实现有效的AI治理。

Result: 研究表明，当前AI出版速度与缺乏强有力的科学标准相结合，通过弱可重复性协议削弱了政策制定者制定有意义政策和治理协议的能力。

Conclusion: 虽然AI治理必须具有反应性，但政策制定者和政府必须将可重复性协议视为治理工具箱中的核心工具，并要求AI研究达到更高标准。

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

TL;DR: 提出了一个三组件框架，结合可解释AI、生存分析和RFM分析来改进客户流失预测，从单纯预测转向个性化保留策略设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流失模型多为黑箱，缺乏对流失原因、干预时机和高风险客户群体的洞察，需要从预测转向基于可解释证据的个性化保留策略。

Method: 集成可解释AI量化特征贡献、生存分析建模流失风险时间、RFM分析按交易行为细分客户的三组件框架。

Result: 该框架能够识别流失驱动因素、估计干预窗口、优先处理目标细分市场，支持减少流失和增强客户忠诚度的策略。

Conclusion: 通过整合多种分析方法，该研究为设计有效的客户保留策略提供了全面且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

Motivation: 现有智能体基准主要关注任务完成度，但忽视了并行和异步操作的时间效率问题，需要专门评估多智能体系统在时间效率方面的规划能力。

Method: 基于Overcooked游戏设计ParaCook环境，提供简化的动作空间来专注于战略并行规划的核心挑战，建立可扩展的评估框架。

Result: 对最先进LLMs的评估显示，当前方法生成次优计划，在并行动作或协调方面存在困难，但在抽象任务中LLMs展现出并行优化的潜力。

Conclusion: ParaCook为开发和评估时间效率感知的多智能体规划建立了基础，揭示了LLMs在并行规划方面的局限性和潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

Conclusion: SR-Scientist成功将LLM提升为自主AI科学家，显著提升了科学方程发现的性能，并展示了良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

Abstract: Mental health applications have emerged as a critical area in computational
health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI
in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved

platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond
general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or
symptom exacerbation, and precise management of vulnerable states to avoid
severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances,
general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges,
including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic
guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in
resource-constrained settings, and adaptation to nuanced dialogues where
generics may introduce biases or miss distress signals. We introduce an

TL;DR: 提出一种结合逆概率加权和降噪处理的条件平均处理效应估计方法，使用Lasso估计线性CATE模型，在治疗效果较小的情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆概率加权转换的结果通常噪声较大，即使使用真实的倾向得分，这影响了CATE估计的准确性。

Method: 采用逆概率加权进行识别，引入降噪程序，使用Lasso估计线性CATE模型，兼顾准确性和可解释性。

Result: 理论证明降噪能减少Lasso的预测误差；在Get-Out-the-Vote和Criteo数据集上，该方法在识别高处理效应个体方面优于非参数机器学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在治疗效果相对较小时特别有效，能够发现与先前实证发现一致的有意义的异质性模式。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for estimating conditional average treatment
effects (CATE) in randomized experiments. We adopt inverse probability
weighting (IPW) for identification; however, IPW-transformed outcomes are known
to be noisy, even when true propensity scores are used. To address this issue,
we introduce a noise reduction procedure and estimate a linear CATE model using
Lasso, achieving both accuracy and interpretability. We theoretically show that
denoising reduces the prediction error of the Lasso. The method is particularly
effective when treatment effects are small relative to the variability of
outcomes, which is often the case in empirical applications. Applications to
the Get-Out-the-Vote dataset and Criteo Uplift Modeling dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms fully nonparametric machine learning methods in
identifying individuals with higher treatment effects. Moreover, our method
uncovers informative heterogeneity patterns that are consistent with previous
empirical findings.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架来识别双重差分设计中处理效应的空间和时间边界，基于流体动力学方程推导出处理效应在空间和时间上呈指数衰减的条件，并通过空气污染案例验证了该框架的诊断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双重差分研究缺乏对处理效应边界的系统识别方法，需要从物理学第一原理出发建立理论框架来准确确定效应衰减的边界范围。

Method: 从纳维-斯托克斯方程出发推导处理效应衰减条件，涵盖线性和非线性扩散机制，基于Péclet和Reynolds数建立可检验的范围条件，并使用791个PM2.5监测点和189,564个NO2卫星网格数据进行实证验证。

Result: 在距离燃煤电厂100公里内，两种污染物均呈现正的空间衰减(PM2.5: κs=0.00200, d*=1,153km; NO2: κs=0.00112, d*=2,062km)，验证了框架有效性；超过100公里后负衰减参数正确指示扩散假设失效。

Conclusion: 严格的边界检测需要从第一原理进行理论推导并对基础物理假设进行实证验证，该框架为研究人员提供了基于物理学的工具来评估空间双重差分设置是否满足扩散假设。

Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal
boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting
from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions
under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling
researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become
undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and
nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable
scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and
Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using
air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based
PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the
Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity:
within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay
(PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s =
0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative
decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion
assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as
satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The
framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed
regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their
spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions
before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary
detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and
empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.

categorical outcomes under binary treatment and binary instrument settings. We
decompose the observed joint probability of outcomes and treatment into
marginal probabilities of potential outcomes and treatment, and association
parameters that capture selection bias due to unobserved heterogeneity. Under a
novel identifying assumption, association similarity, which requires the
dependence between unobserved factors and potential outcomes to be invariant
across treatment states, we achieve point identification of the full
distribution of potential outcomes. Recognizing that this assumption may be
strong in some contexts, we propose two weaker alternatives: monotonic
association, which restricts the direction of selection heterogeneity, and
bounded association, which constrains its magnitude. These relaxed assumptions
deliver sharp partial identification bounds that nest point identification as a
special case and facilitate transparent sensitivity analysis. We illustrate the
framework in an empirical application, estimating the causal effect of private
health insurance on health outcomes.

TL;DR: 该论文通过整合高维数据、正则化、样本外验证和非线性建模三个关键原则，预测宏观经济结果的完整条件分布，实时准确预测宏观经济风险的全貌。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大量宏观经济和金融预测因子中的丰富信息，准确预测宏观经济风险的完整分布，为实时风险管理提供支持。

Method: 采用高维数据配合适当的正则化（收缩方法），结合严格的样本外验证程序，并引入非线性建模方法。

Result: 研究发现正则化对于控制模型复杂度至关重要，而非线性建模对预测准确性的提升有限；样本外验证在模型架构选择和防止过拟合方面发挥关键作用。

Conclusion: 通过系统整合高维数据、正则化和样本外验证，能够有效预测宏观经济条件的完整分布，其中正则化和样本外验证是成功预测的关键要素。

Abstract: We forecast the full conditional distribution of macroeconomic outcomes by
systematically integrating three key principles: using high-dimensional data
with appropriate regularization, adopting rigorous out-of-sample validation
procedures, and incorporating nonlinearities. By exploiting the rich
information embedded in a large set of macroeconomic and financial predictors,
we produce accurate predictions of the entire profile of macroeconomic risk in
real time. Our findings show that regularization via shrinkage is essential to
control model complexity, while introducing nonlinearities yields limited
improvements in predictive accuracy. Out-of-sample validation plays a critical
role in selecting model architecture and preventing overfitting.

TL;DR: 印尼制造业中的超级明星企业（市场份额最高的企业）通过水平和垂直渠道对非超级明星企业产生正向生产率溢出效应，但外资和本土超级明星的溢出模式不同，且存在资源配置不当问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究超级明星企业是否帮助其他企业提升生产率还是挤占其发展空间，特别是在印尼这样的发展中经济体背景下。

Method: 使用2001-2015年印尼制造业企业数据，分析超级明星企业通过水平和垂直渠道对非超级明星企业生产率的溢出效应，并按所有权类型区分。

Result: 超级明星企业总体上通过水平和垂直渠道提升非超级明星企业的生产率水平和增长。外资超级明星主要通过垂直渠道产生正向溢出，本土超级明星则通过两种渠道都产生正向溢出。但存在资源配置不当问题，特别是本土超级明星企业。

Conclusion: 超级明星企业对其他企业有正向生产率溢出效应，但外资和本土企业的溢出模式不同。印尼超级明星企业虽然运营效率高，但增长缓慢，可能因创新活动有限或技术采用缓慢导致潜在停滞。

Abstract: Do industrial "superstars" help others up or crowd them out? We examine the
relationship between the spillovers of superstar firms (those with the top
market share in their industry) and the productivity dynamics in Indonesia.
Employing data on Indonesian manufacturing firms from 2001 to 2015, we find
that superstar exposures in the market raise both the productivity level and
the growth of non-superstar firms through horizontal (within a sector-province)
and vertical (across sectors) channels. When we distinguish by ownership,
foreign superstars consistently encourage productivity except through the
horizontal channel. In contrast, domestic superstars generate positive
spillovers through both horizontal and vertical linkages, indicating that
foreign firms do not solely drive positive externalities. Furthermore, despite
overall productivity growth being positive in 2001-2015, the source of negative
growth is mainly driven by within-group reallocation, evidence of misallocation
among surviving firms, notably by domestic superstars. Although Indonesian
superstar firms are more efficient in their operations, their relatively modest
growth rates suggest a potential stagnation, which can be plausibly attributed
to limited innovation activity or a slow pace of adopting new technologies.

TL;DR: 提出了组合式双重差分（CoDiD）方法，用于处理分类结果的双重差分分析，解决了线性DiD模型的尺度依赖性和负反事实数量问题，基于平行增长假设识别反事实分类数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分类结果的DiD设置中，线性DiD模型存在尺度依赖性、可能产生负反事实数量、与离散选择理论不一致等问题，需要开发更合适的方法。

Method: 提出CoDiD方法，基于平行增长假设（在无处理情况下，各分类在实验组和对照组中以相同比例增长或收缩），在随机效用框架下推导相对偏好的平行演化，并在Aitchison几何中对应概率质量函数的平行轨迹。

Result: CoDiD方法能够识别反事实分类数量，从而得到总水平和份额，并扩展到边界推导、交错采用处理和合成DiD类似方法。

Conclusion: CoDiD为分类结果的DiD分析提供了理论一致的方法，通过两个实证应用（早期投票改革对选民选择的影响、RGGI对电力构成的影响）展示了方法的实证相关性。

Abstract: In difference-in-differences (DiD) settings with categorical outcomes,
treatment effects often operate on both total quantities (e.g., voter turnout)
and category shares (e.g., vote distribution across parties). In this context,
linear DiD models can be problematic: they suffer from scale dependence, may
produce negative counterfactual quantities, and are inconsistent with discrete
choice theory. We propose compositional DiD (CoDiD), a new method that
identifies counterfactual categorical quantities, and thus total levels and
shares, under a parallel growths assumption. The assumption states that, absent
treatment, each category's size grows or shrinks at the same proportional rate
in treated and control groups. In a random utility framework, we show that this
implies parallel evolution of relative preferences between any pair of
categories. Analytically, we show that it also means the shares are reallocated
in the same way in both groups in the absence of treatment. Finally,
geometrically, it corresponds to parallel trajectories (or movements) of
probability mass functions of the two groups in the probability simplex under
Aitchison geometry. We extend CoDiD to i) derive bounds under relaxed
assumptions, ii) handle staggered adoption, and iii) propose a synthetic DiD
analog. We illustrate the method's empirical relevance through two
applications: first, we examine how early voting reforms affect voter choice in
U.S. presidential elections; second, we analyze how the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative (RGGI) affected the composition of electricity generation across
sources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个关于政府负责任AI采用中数据相关挑战的分类法，基于系统文献回顾和专家评估，识别了13个关键技术、组织和环境维度的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在公共部门具有变革潜力，但由于复杂的技术、组织和制度挑战，采用仍然不均衡。负责任AI框架强调公平性、问责制和透明度，但往往忽视了技术和制度现实，特别是基础数据和治理问题。

Method: 基于对43项研究的系统回顾和21位专家评估，开发了数据相关挑战的分类法。

Result: 识别了13个关键挑战，包括数据质量差、AI就绪基础设施有限、治理薄弱、人机决策错位、经济和环境可持续性担忧等，涵盖技术、组织和环境维度。

Conclusion: 该分类法可作为诊断工具，揭示高风险AI部署的'症状'，并指导政策制定者建立负责任AI采用所需的制度和数据治理条件。

Abstract: Despite Artificial Intelligence (AI) transformative potential for public
sector services, decision-making, and administrative efficiency, adoption
remains uneven due to complex technical, organizational, and institutional
challenges. Responsible AI frameworks emphasize fairness, accountability, and
transparency, aligning with principles of trustworthy AI and fair AI, yet
remain largely aspirational, overlooking technical and institutional realities,
especially foundational data and governance. This study addresses this gap by
developing a taxonomy of data-related challenges to responsible AI adoption in
government. Based on a systematic review of 43 studies and 21 expert
evaluations, the taxonomy identifies 13 key challenges across technological,
organizational, and environmental dimensions, including poor data quality,
limited AI-ready infrastructure, weak governance, misalignment in human-AI
decision-making, economic and environmental sustainability concerns. Annotated
with institutional pressures, the taxonomy serves as a diagnostic tool to
surface 'symptoms' of high-risk AI deployment and guides policymakers in
building the institutional and data governance conditions necessary for
responsible AI adoption.

Method: 研究团队分析并缓解了AI回复中的潜在偏见，通过测试聊天机器人在多样化学生查询上的表现，评估其准确性、相关性、个性化和偏见存在情况。

Result: AI聊天机器人取得了平均9.76的准确性得分、9.56的相关性得分和9.60的个性化得分，样本数据中未发现刻板印象偏见。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的提示工程和偏见缓解策略，AI聊天机器人能够提供高质量、无偏见的学术咨询支持，为高等教育中构建伦理AI系统提供了最佳实践参考。

Abstract: Selecting a college major is a difficult decision for many incoming freshmen.
Traditional academic advising is often hindered by long wait times,
intimidating environments, and limited personalization. AI Chatbots present an
opportunity to address these challenges. However, AI systems also have the
potential to generate biased responses, prejudices related to race, gender,
socioeconomic status, and disability. These biases risk turning away potential
students and undermining reliability of AI systems. This study aims to develop
a University of Maryland (UMD) A. James Clark School of Engineering
Program-specific AI chatbot. Our research team analyzed and mitigated potential
biases in the responses. Through testing the chatbot on diverse student
queries, the responses are scored on metrics of accuracy, relevance,
personalization, and bias presence. The results demonstrate that with careful
prompt engineering and bias mitigation strategies, AI chatbots can provide
high-quality, unbiased academic advising support, achieving mean scores of 9.76
for accuracy, 9.56 for relevance, and 9.60 for personalization with no
stereotypical biases found in the sample data. However, due to the small sample
size and limited timeframe, our AI model may not fully reflect the nuances of
student queries in engineering academic advising. Regardless, these findings
will inform best practices for building ethical AI systems in higher education,
offering tools to complement traditional advising and address the inequities
faced by many underrepresented and first-generation college students.

Motivation: 欧盟及其成员国每年拨款数百万欧元资助发展项目，但申请数量激增导致评估过程出现瓶颈，主要受限于人力不足。

Method: 在两个政府项目中部署AI辅助评估系统：(i)企业国际业务扩张申请；(ii)公民节能家居投资报销申请。

Result: 在公民报销申请项目中，AI解决方案使审核员工作效率提高20.1%，误报率极低，总体评估时间减少超过2个月。

Conclusion: AI驱动的自动化在大规模评估工作流程中具有显著影响，能够有效提升处理效率和减少工作量。

Abstract: Every year, the European Union and its member states allocate millions of
euros to fund various development initiatives. However, the increasing number
of applications received for these programs often creates significant
bottlenecks in evaluation processes, due to limited human capacity. In this
work, we detail the real-world deployment of AI-assisted evaluation within the
pipeline of two government initiatives: (i) corporate applications aimed at
international business expansion, and (ii) citizen reimbursement claims for
investments in energy-efficient home improvements. While these two cases
involve distinct evaluation procedures, our findings confirm that AI
effectively enhanced processing efficiency and reduced workload across both
types of applications. Specifically, in the citizen reimbursement claims
initiative, our solution increased reviewer productivity by 20.1%, while
keeping a negligible false-positive rate based on our test set observations.
These improvements resulted in an overall reduction of more than 2 months in
the total evaluation time, illustrating the impact of AI-driven automation in
large-scale evaluation workflows.

Motivation: 计算思维是高等教育中学生适应技术驱动未来的关键技能，但高等教育中的CT教育研究不足，教师缺乏相关知识和支持。AI在教育中的广泛应用为CT教育提供了支持潜力，但缺乏全面的整合概述。

Method: 采用系统文献综述方法，识别高等教育中应用AI的CT教育举措，探索教育方面的多个维度。

Result: 研究提供了AI在CT教育中应用的清单，分析了整合的各个方面，包括益处与挑战（如重塑CT教育vs可能削弱学生创造力），以及在AI背景下的新CT视角（如解码方法与编码方法）。

Conclusion: 该研究为CT教育社区提供了实践和科学贡献，包括AI基础举措清单、AI整合CT教育的多方面概述，以及在AI背景下对CT的新视角见解。

Abstract: Computational Thinking (CT) is a key skill set for students in higher
education to thrive and adapt to an increasingly technology-driven future and
workplace. While research on CT education has gained remarkable momentum in K12
over the past decade, it has remained under-explored in higher education,
leaving higher education teachers with an insufficient overview, knowledge, and
support regarding CT education. The proliferation and adoption of artificial
intelligence (AI) by educational institutions have demonstrated promising
potential to support instructional activities across many disciplines,
including CT education. However, a comprehensive overview outlining the various
aspects of integrating AI in CT education in higher education is lacking. To
mitigate this gap, we conducted this systematic literature review study. The
focus of our study is to identify initiatives applying AI in CT education
within higher education and to explore various educational aspects of these
initiatives, including the benefits and challenges of AI in CT education,
instructional strategies employed, CT components covered, and AI techniques and
models utilized. This study provides practical and scientific contributions to
the CT education community, including an inventory of AI-based initiatives for
CT education useful to educators, an overview of various aspects of integrating
AI into CT education such as its benefits and challenges (e.g., AI potential to
reshape CT education versus its potential to diminish students creativity) and
insights into new and expanded perspectives on CT in light of AI (e.g., the
decoding approach alongside the coding approach to CT).

Conclusion: 保护综述论文的完整性对研究社区已不再是可选项，而是必须采取行动的当务之急，需要建立强有力的人工智能使用规范和新的基础设施。

Abstract: Survey papers are foundational to the scholarly progress of research
communities, offering structured overviews that guide both novices and experts
across disciplines. However, the recent surge of AI-generated surveys,
especially enabled by large language models (LLMs), has transformed this
traditionally labor-intensive genre into a low-effort, high-volume output.
While such automation lowers entry barriers, it also introduces a critical
threat: the phenomenon we term the "survey paper DDoS attack" to the research
community. This refers to the unchecked proliferation of superficially
comprehensive but often redundant, low-quality, or even hallucinated survey
manuscripts, which floods preprint platforms, overwhelms researchers, and
erodes trust in the scientific record. In this position paper, we argue that we
must stop uploading massive amounts of AI-generated survey papers (i.e., survey
paper DDoS attack) to the research community, by instituting strong norms for
AI-assisted review writing. We call for restoring expert oversight and
transparency in AI usage and, moreover, developing new infrastructures such as
Dynamic Live Surveys, community-maintained, version-controlled repositories
that blend automated updates with human curation. Through quantitative trend
analysis, quality audits, and cultural impact discussion, we show that
safeguarding the integrity of surveys is no longer optional but imperative to
the research community.

Abstract: Geographic data is vital in understanding, analyzing, and contextualizing
energy usage at the regional level within electricity systems. While geospatial
visualizations of electricity infrastructure and distributions of production
and consumption are available from governmental and third-party sources, these
sources are often disparate, and compatible geographic datasets remain scarce.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive geographic dataset representing the
electricity system in Norway. We collect data from multiple authoritative
sources, process it into widely accepted formats, and generate interactive maps
based on this data. Our dataset includes information for each municipality in
Norway for the year 2024, encompassing electricity infrastructure, consumption,
renewable and conventional production, main power grid topology, relevant
natural resources, and population demographics. This work results in a
formatted geographic dataset that integrates diverse informational resources,
along with openly released interactive maps. We anticipate that our dataset
will alleviate software incompatibilities in data retrieval, and facilitate
joint analyses on regional electricity system for energy researchers,
stakeholders, and developers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在高等教育中的普及对传统教学框架构成根本挑战，其统计逻辑和无摩擦信息获取可能削弱学生认知过程，导致学生绕过培养推理能力所需的智力工作。

Method: 采用Jacques Rancière的智力解放理论框架，批判分析生成式AI在教育中的风险，并提出解放性教学法，强调验证、掌握和共同探究。

Result: 揭示了生成式AI在教育中存在的悖论：虽然AI系统本身训练用于复杂推理，但学生却用它来规避培养这些能力的智力工作。

Conclusion: 应建立解放性教学框架，将生成式AI定位为智力工作的材料而非替代品，强调元认知意识和批判性审问AI输出，要求教育者直接参与以培养学生批判性AI素养。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models in higher education presents a
fundamental challenge to traditional pedagogical frameworks. Drawing on Jacques
Ranci\`ere's theory of intellectual emancipation, this paper examines how
generative AI risks becoming a "mechanical yes-man" that reinforces passivity
rather than fostering intellectual autonomy. Generative AI's statistical logic
and lack of causal reasoning, combined with frictionless information access,
threatens to hollow out cognitive processes essential for genuine learning.
This creates a critical paradox: while generative AI systems are trained for
complex reasoning, students increasingly use them to bypass the intellectual
work that builds such capabilities. The paper critiques both techno-optimistic
and restrictive approaches to generative AI in education, proposing instead an
emancipatory pedagogy grounded in verification, mastery, and co-inquiry. This
framework positions generative AI as material for intellectual work rather than
a substitute for it, emphasising the cultivation of metacognitive awareness and
critical interrogation of AI outputs. It requires educators to engage directly
with these tools to guide students toward critical AI literacy, transforming
pedagogical authority from explication to critical interloping that models
intellectual courage and collaborative inquiry.

Motivation: 调查信誉新闻网站和虚假信息网站在robots.txt文件中对AI爬虫的配置差异，以及这种差异如何影响LLMs的训练数据获取。

Method: 分析精选数据集中的robots.txt文件配置，测量网站对AI爬虫的实际阻止行为，并进行纵向时间分析。

Result: 信誉网站平均禁止15.5个AI用户代理，虚假信息网站禁止少于1个；AI阻止率从2023年9月的23%上升到2025年5月的近60%。

Conclusion: 内容可访问性的不对称性可能影响LLMs的训练数据，引发关于网络透明度、数据伦理和AI训练实践的思考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on web crawling to stay
up to date and accurately answer user queries. These crawlers are expected to
honor robots.txt files, which govern automated access. In this study, for the
first time, we investigate whether reputable news websites and misinformation
sites differ in how they configure these files, particularly in relation to AI
crawlers. Analyzing a curated dataset, we find a stark contrast: 60.0% of
reputable sites disallow at least one AI crawler, compared to just 9.1% of
misinformation sites in their robots.txt files. Reputable sites forbid an
average of 15.5 AI user agents, while misinformation sites prohibit fewer than
one. We then measure active blocking behavior, where websites refuse to return
content when HTTP requests include AI crawler user agents, and reveal that both
categories of websites utilize it. Notably, the behavior of reputable news
websites in this regard aligns more closely with their declared robots.txt
directive than that of misinformation websites. Finally, our longitudinal
analysis reveals that this gap has widened over time, with AI-blocking by
reputable sites rising from 23% in September 2023 to nearly 60% by May 2025.
Our findings highlight a growing asymmetry in content accessibility that may
shape the training data available to LLMs, raising essential questions for web
transparency, data ethics, and the future of AI training practices.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting pedestrian dynamics has become essential for
shaping safer, more responsive, and human-centered urban environments. This
study conducts a comprehensive scientometric analysis of research on
data-driven pedestrian trajectory prediction and crowd simulation, mapping its
intellectual evolution and interdisciplinary structure. Using bibliometric data
from the Web of Science Core Collection, we employ SciExplorer and Bibliometrix
to identify major trends, influential contributors, and emerging frontiers.
Results reveal a strong convergence between artificial intelligence, urban
informatics, and crowd behavior modeling--driven by graph neural networks,
transformers, and generative models. Beyond technical advances, the field
increasingly informs urban mobility design, public safety planning, and digital
twin development for smart cities. However, challenges remain in ensuring
interpretability, inclusivity, and cross-domain transferability. By connecting
methodological trajectories with urban applications, this work highlights how
data-driven approaches can enrich urban governance and pave the way for
adaptive, socially responsible mobility intelligence in future cities.

Abstract: The technological revolution of the Internet has digitized the social,
economic, political, and cultural activities of billions of humans. While
researchers have been paying due attention to concerns of misinformation and
bias, these obscure a much less researched and equally insidious problem - that
of uncritically consuming incomplete information. The problem of incomplete
information consumption stems from the very nature of explicitly ranked
information on digital platforms, where our limited mental capacities leave us
with little choice but to consume the tip of a pre-ranked information iceberg.
This study makes two chief contributions. First, we leverage the context of
internet search to propose an innovative metric that quantifies information
completeness. For a given search query, this refers to the extent of the
information spectrum that is observed during web browsing. We then validate
this metric using 6.5 trillion search results extracted from daily search
trends across 48 nations for one year. Second, we find causal evidence that
awareness of information completeness while browsing the Internet reduces
resistance to factual information, hence paving the way towards an open-minded
and tolerant mindset.

*Fuze Sun,Paul Craig,Lingyu Li,Shixiangyue Meng,Chuxi Nan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本章探讨了在文化多元的在线高等教育环境中使用文化感知AI代理（由生成式AI驱动）来促进参与度和改善学习成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线高等教育的全球化发展，大学需要容纳来自不同文化背景的学生，这带来了语言障碍、学习风格差异、课程设计文化敏感性以及学生孤立感等挑战。

Method: 通过回顾现有研究，提出使用由生成式AI（如大型语言模型）驱动的文化感知AI代理，这些代理能够个性化学习并调整互动方式和内容传递以符合学生的文化背景。

Result: 研究表明，文化感知AI代理有潜力通过提供与文化背景相关的个性化学习体验来解决在线教育中的文化多样性挑战。

Conclusion: 文化感知AI代理，特别是由生成式AI驱动的代理，能够有效促进文化多元在线高等教育环境中的学生参与度和学习成果。

Abstract: As the global reach of online higher education continues to grow,
universities are increasingly accommodating students from diverse cultural
backgrounds \parencite{tereshko2024culturally}. This can present a number of
challenges including linguistic barriers \parencite{ullah2021linguistic},
cultural differences in learning style \parencite{omidvar2012cultural},
cultural sensitivity in course design \parencite{nguyen2022cultural} and
perceived isolation when students feel their perspectives or experiences are
not reflected or valued in the learning environment
\parencite{hansen2022belonging}. Ensuring active engagement and reasonable
learning outcomes in such a environments requires distance educational systems
that are not only adaptive but also culturally resonant
\parencite{dalle2024cultural}. Both embodied and virtual AI-Agents have great
potential in this regard as they can facilitate personalized learning and adapt
their interactions and content delivery to align with students' cultural
context. In addition Generative AI (GAI), such as, Large Language Models (LLMs)
can amplify the potential for these culturally aware AI agents to address
educational challenges due to their advanced capacity for understanding and
generating contextually relevant content \parencite{wang2024large}. This
chapter reviews existing research and suggests the usage of culturally aware
AI-Agents, powered by GAI, to foster engagement and improve learning outcomes
in culturally diverse online higher education environments.

### [341] [Making Power Explicable in AI: Analyzing, Understanding, and Redirecting Power to Operationalize Ethics in AI Technical Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10588)
*Weina Jin,Elise Li Zheng,Ghassan Hamarneh*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文从可解释AI角度分析AI伦理实施失效问题，诊断其根源为AI社会技术系统中权力结构失衡，并提出三项干预建议来应对权力失衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI伦理在技术实践中的操作化面临重大挑战，需要解决AI伦理实施无效的问题。作者从可解释AI在现实世界实施伦理的角度出发，分析这一现象。

Method: 首先通过四个实证案例描述AI伦理在可解释AI中实施无效的"症状"，然后诊断其根源为权力结构失衡，最后基于对权力机制的理解提出三项干预建议。

Result: 诊断出AI伦理实施无效的根源在于AI社会技术系统中权力结构的功能失调和失衡，这些权力结构由不公正且不受制约的权力主导，无法代表公众和受影响社区的利益。

Conclusion: 提出了三项干预建议：1)使权力可解释和受制约；2)重构AI和AI伦理的叙事和假设；3)联合伦理和科学努力将伦理价值编码为技术标准。这些建议可为AI社区和公民社会提供有用参考。

Abstract: The operationalization of ethics in the technical practices of artificial
intelligence (AI) is facing significant challenges. To address the problem of
ineffective implementation of AI ethics, we present our diagnosis, analysis,
and interventional recommendations from a unique perspective of the real-world
implementation of AI ethics through explainable AI (XAI) techniques. We first
describe the phenomenon (i.e., the "symptoms") of ineffective implementation of
AI ethics in explainable AI using four empirical cases. From the "symptoms", we
diagnose the root cause (i.e., the "disease") being the dysfunction and
imbalance of power structures in the sociotechnical system of AI. The power
structures are dominated by unjust and unchecked power that does not represent
the benefits and interests of the public and the most impacted communities, and
cannot be countervailed by ethical power. Based on the understanding of power
mechanisms, we propose three interventional recommendations to tackle the root
cause, including: 1) Making power explicable and checked, 2) Reframing the
narratives and assumptions of AI and AI ethics to check unjust power and
reflect the values and benefits of the public, and 3) Uniting the efforts of
ethical and scientific conduct of AI to encode ethical values as technical
standards, norms, and methods, including conducting critical examinations and
limitation analyses of AI technical practices. We hope that our diagnosis and
interventional recommendations can be a useful input to the AI community and
civil society's ongoing discussion and implementation of ethics in AI for
ethical and responsible AI practice.

*Tamara Paris,Shalaleh Rismani*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出需要超越传统开放标准（数据、模型、代码等），采用更全面的系统级方法来评估AI系统的开放性，借鉴系统安全领域的五个经验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI系统开放性评估框架仅关注数据、模型、代码等狭义标准，无法评估开放性的实际效果（如民主化和自主性）。需要更全面的方法考虑发布背景：谁重用系统、为何目的、在什么条件下。

Method: 借鉴系统安全领域的五个经验教训，为系统级开放性评估提供指导。

Result: 提出了一个更全面的系统级开放性评估框架，能够更好地评估开放性是否实现其预期效果。

Conclusion: 评估AI系统开放性需要超越传统狭义标准，采用考虑发布背景的系统级方法，借鉴系统安全经验可以提供有价值的指导。

Abstract: Most frameworks for assessing the openness of AI systems use narrow criteria
such as availability of data, model, code, documentation, and licensing terms.
However, to evaluate whether the intended effects of openness - such as
democratization and autonomy - are realized, we need a more holistic approach
that considers the context of release: who will reuse the system, for what
purposes, and under what conditions. To this end, we adapt five lessons from
system safety that offer guidance on how openness can be evaluated at the
system level.

### [343] [Detecting Gender Stereotypes in Scratch Programming Tutorials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11064)
*Isabella Graßl,Benedikt Fein,Gordon Fraser*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文开发了一个自动化框架来识别Scratch编程教程中的性别刻板印象问题，并探索了使用大语言模型来检测和改进教学内容的性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程入门课程中的性别刻板印象往往被忽视，但会对年轻学习者特别是女生的兴趣和学习产生负面影响。当前教育工作者缺乏识别和解决这种偏见的方法，而LLMs生成教学材料可能加剧这一问题。

Method: 开发了一个评估性别偏见的框架，考虑角色、内容、指令和编程概念，并创建一个自动化工具链来识别"性别刻板印象气味"。在73个流行Scratch教程上进行了评估。

Result: 实践中的刻板印象气味很常见。LLMs在检测这些气味方面效果不佳，但性别偏见评估框架可以指导LLMs生成刻板印象气味更少的教程。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs本身不能有效检测性别刻板印象，但通过适当的框架指导，它们可以帮助生成更少偏见的教学内容，为解决编程教育中的性别偏见问题提供了新途径。

Abstract: Gender stereotypes in introductory programming courses often go unnoticed,
yet they can negatively influence young learners' interest and learning,
particularly under-represented groups such as girls. Popular tutorials on
block-based programming with Scratch may unintentionally reinforce biases
through character choices, narrative framing, or activity types. Educators
currently lack support in identifying and addressing such bias. With large
language models~(LLMs) increasingly used to generate teaching materials, this
problem is potentially exacerbated by LLMs trained on biased datasets. However,
LLMs also offer an opportunity to address this issue. In this paper, we explore
the use of LLMs for automatically identifying gender-stereotypical elements in
Scratch tutorials, thus offering feedback on how to improve teaching content.
We develop a framework for assessing gender bias considering characters,
content, instructions, and programming concepts. Analogous to how code analysis
tools provide feedback on code in terms of code smells, we operationalise this
framework using an automated tool chain that identifies *gender stereotype
smells*. Evaluation on 73 popular Scratch tutorials from leading educational
platforms demonstrates that stereotype smells are common in practice. LLMs are
not effective at detecting them, but our gender bias evaluation framework can
guide LLMs in generating tutorials with fewer stereotype smells.

TL;DR: 该论文提出LLM-MATE方法，利用大型语言模型基于预定义评分标准处理学生评估，生成个性化反馈以解决大规模班级评估的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动化评估方法反馈过于简单，无法提供个性化指导。学术界需要为大规模班级提供及时、相关的建设性反馈。

Method: 使用大型语言模型处理学生评估，结合预定义的评分标准和标记准则，生成个性化反馈。以软件架构模块为案例研究进行验证。

Result: LLM-MATE方法能帮助教师应对大规模班级评估挑战，让学生及时获得个性化反馈改进学习，同时通过ChatGPT API建立评估反馈的自动化生成基础。

Conclusion: LLM-MATE方法有效解决了大规模班级个性化反馈的难题，提升了学生学习效果，减轻了教师评估负担。

Abstract: The evolving pedagogy paradigms are leading toward educational
transformations. One fundamental aspect of effective learning is relevant,
immediate, and constructive feedback to students. Providing constructive
feedback to large cohorts in academia is an ongoing challenge. Therefore,
academics are moving towards automated assessment to provide immediate
feedback. However, current approaches are often limited in scope, offering
simplistic responses that do not provide students with personalized feedback to
guide them toward improvements. This paper addresses this limitation by
investigating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing
students assessments with predefined rubrics and marking criteria to generate
personalized feedback for in-depth learning. We aim to leverage the power of
existing LLMs for Marking Assessments, Tracking, and Evaluation (LLM-MATE) with
personalized feedback to enhance students learning. To evaluate the performance
of LLM-MATE, we consider the Software Architecture (SA) module as a case study.
The LLM-MATE approach can help module leaders overcome assessment challenges
with large cohorts. Also, it helps students improve their learning by obtaining
personalized feedback in a timely manner. Additionally, the proposed approach
will facilitate the establishment of ground truth for automating the generation
of students assessment feedback using the ChatGPT API, thereby reducing the
overhead associated with large cohort assessments.

TL;DR: 该研究分析社交媒体上关于COVID-19疫苗的阴谋论评论，使用BERT和Perspective API模型对598条独特评论进行情感分析和毒性检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上充斥着反疫苗评论和阴谋论，如5G网络传播病毒、中国生物武器论、比尔·盖茨追踪阴谋等，这些理论导致了实际破坏行为和疫苗犹豫，需要系统分析。

Method: 收集598条与COVID-19疫苗相关的独特评论，使用BERT模型进行情感分析，使用Perspective API检测评论毒性。

Result: 研究发现了社交媒体上针对COVID-19疫苗的各种阴谋论评论，并分析了这些评论的情感和毒性特征。

Conclusion: 社交媒体上的阴谋论评论对公众信任和疫苗接种产生了负面影响，需要采取有效措施应对这些有害信息。

Abstract: Since the beginning of the vaccination trial, social media has been flooded
with anti-vaccination comments and conspiracy beliefs. As the day passes, the
number of COVID- 19 cases increases, and online platforms and a few news
portals entertain sharing different conspiracy theories. The most popular
conspiracy belief was the link between the 5G network spreading COVID-19 and
the Chinese government spreading the virus as a bioweapon, which initially
created racial hatred. Although some disbelief has less impact on society,
others create massive destruction. For example, the 5G conspiracy led to the
burn of the 5G Tower, and belief in the Chinese bioweapon story promoted an
attack on the Asian-Americans. Another popular conspiracy belief was that Bill
Gates spread this Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by launching a mass
vaccination program to track everyone. This Conspiracy belief creates distrust
issues among laypeople and creates vaccine hesitancy. This study aims to
discover the conspiracy theory against the vaccine on social platforms. We
performed a sentiment analysis on the 598 unique sample comments related to
COVID-19 vaccines. We used two different models, BERT and Perspective API, to
find out the sentiment and toxicity of the sentence toward the COVID-19
vaccine.

### [346] [Optimal annuitization with labor income under age-dependent force of mortality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10371)
*Criscent Birungi,Cody Hyndman*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: 本文研究了带劳动收入的最优年金化问题，使用动态规划方法推导出闭式解，分析了退休前后投资消费行为变化及年金化决策的影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在考虑劳动收入和年龄相关死亡率的条件下，代理人如何最大化消费和劳动收入的效用，特别关注年金化决策的影响因素。

Method: 采用动态规划方法，推导出价值函数以及最优消费、投资组合和劳动供给策略的闭式解。

Result: 退休前投资行为随财富增加而增加，但受劳动供给阈值限制；退休后消费财富比例增加。年金化决策受代理人个人贴现率（需求侧）和保险公司支付率（供给侧）共同影响，高龄时死亡率急剧下降使年金化成为最优选择。

Conclusion: 退休后劳动收入可作为年金化的直接替代品，提供稳定的收入来源，增强退休人员的财务安全性。超过一定年龄后，死亡率优惠的强大激励会超过代理人的高个人贴现率，使年金化成为实质性最优选择。

Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal annuitization with labour income, where an
agent aims to maximize utility from consumption and labour income under
age-dependent force of mortality. Using a dynamic programming approach, we
derive closed-form solutions for the value function and the optimal
consumption, portfolio, and labor supply strategies. Our results show that
before retirement, investment behavior increases with wealth until a threshold
set by labor supply. After retirement, agents tend to consume a larger portion
of their wealth. Two main factors influence optimal annuitization decisions as
people get older. First, the agent's perspective (demand side); the agent's
personal discount rate rises with age, reducing their desire to annuitize.
Second, the insurer's perspective (supply side); insurers offer higher payout
rates (mortality credits). Our model demonstrates that beyond a certain age,
sharply declining survival probabilities make annuitization substantially
optimal, as the powerful incentive of mortality credits outweighs the agent's
high personal discount rate. Finally, post-retirement labor income serves as a
direct substitute for annuitization by providing an alternative stable income
source. It enhances the financial security of retirees.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: 该研究比较了SSE和NYSE指数的投资策略表现，发现不同市场对投资策略的反应不同，p-ratio策略在SSE表现最佳，而NYSE中EEF策略表现中等，p-index对NYSE有增量信息价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同投资策略在不同股票市场（SSE和NYSE）中的表现差异，探索p-ratio和p-index等指标在投资决策中的有效性。

Method: 使用实证分析方法，比较不同持有期（一周和一个月）和再投资策略下的投资表现，分析p-ratio、EEF策略和p-index与收益的关系。

Result: 1) SSE中一周持有期最高p-ratio策略收益最大；2) NYSE中所有策略均产生负收益；3) NYSE中p-index与月收益呈正线性关系；4) 传统五因子模型在NYSE表现不佳，加入p-index可改善。

Conclusion: 不同市场对投资策略的反应存在显著差异，p-index在NYSE中具有增量信息价值，可为投资决策提供参考。

Abstract: The empirical results have shown that firstly, with one-week holding period
and reinvesting, for SSE Composite Index stocks, the highest p-ratio investment
strategy produces the largest annualized rate of return; and for NYSE Composite
Index stocks, all the three strategies with both one-week and one-month periods
generate negative returns. Secondly, with non-reinvesting, for SSE Composite
Index stocks, the highest p-ratio strategy with one-week holding period yields
the largest annualized rate of return; and for NYSE Composite stocks, the
one-week EEF strategy produces a medium annualized return. Thirdly, under the
one-week EEF investment strategy, for NYSE Composite Index stocks, the right
frontier yields a higher annualized return, but for SSE Composite Index stocks,
the left frontier (stocks on the empirical efficient frontier) yields a higher
annualized return than the right frontier. Fourthly, for NYSE Composite Index
stocks, there is a positive linear relationship between monthly return and the
p-index, but no such relationship is evident for SSE Composite Index stocks.
Fifthly, for NYSE Composite Index stocks, the traditional five-factor model
performs poorly, and adding the p-index as a sixth factor provides incremental
information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除预测任务中的前瞻偏差，确保模型训练数据与预测时间点的严格分离，提供无数据泄露的预测工具。

Method: 训练仅使用截止日期前数据的指令跟随大型语言模型，采用固定模型权重和对话式聊天界面。

Result: 开发出具有时间一致性、可复现性的生成AI工具，能够为各种预测任务提供保守的准确性下限。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员提供了一个易于使用、无前瞻偏差的生成AI工具，适用于广泛的预测任务，并确保预测结果的可信度。

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following
large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only
on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring
strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework
offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习在推荐系统中面临负迁移和跷跷板现象的挑战，由于现实推荐中任务相关性复杂且矛盾，需要更好地利用个性化信息来管理任务冲突。

Method: 提出个性化直接路由梯度框架(DRGrad)，包含三个核心组件：路由器、更新器和个性化门网络，在训练过程中判断任务间利益关系，利用所有有效梯度减少冲突。

Result: 在150亿样本的真实推荐数据集上，DRGrad在AUC指标上优于现有最先进的多任务学习模型，能有效管理任务冲突且不增加模型复杂度，同时在公共Census-income和合成数据集上也验证了其判断和路由能力。

Conclusion: DRGrad框架能有效解决多任务学习中的任务冲突问题，通过个性化路由机制提升了模型性能，特别是在处理不同相关性和个性化程度的任务时表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with
varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

Motivation: 快速城市化加剧了交通拥堵、环境压力和交通系统低效问题，传统基于静态信号和人工监控的系统无法适应现代交通的动态特性，急需智能自适应交通管理解决方案。

Method: 集成CCTV监控视频与多源数据描述符，采用时空特征融合、频繁序列模式挖掘(FEM)发现顺序交通模式，以及混合LSTM-Transformer模型进行稳健的交通状态预测。

Result: 在包含313,931个标注边界框的CityFlowV2数据集上，预测准确率达到98.46%，宏观精确度0.9800，宏观召回率0.9839，宏观F1分数0.9819。FEM分析揭示了置信度超过55%的显著顺序模式，系统生成了46个持续拥堵警报。

Conclusion: 强调将视频流分析与多源数据结合对于设计实时、响应式、自适应的多层次智能交通系统的必要性，这能使城市交通更智能和安全。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,
and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for
intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems
relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic
nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework
that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,
responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which
makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

Result: 该方法能够显著减少计算时间，扩散步骤可在推理时调整以平衡速度和质量。

Conclusion: 基于深度学习的方法在早期研究阶段特别有用，此时快速探索比绝对精度更重要。

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究制度条件生成场景与凸CVaR分配器结合是否能改善制度转换下的投资组合决策，特别是在尾部风险和回撤控制方面。

Method: 提出多智能体制度条件扩散(MARCD)方法：1)通过高斯HMM推断潜在制度；2)训练具有尾部加权目标和制度专业化混合专家去噪器的扩散模型；3)将生成场景输入考虑换手率的CVaR二次规划问题。

Result: 在2005-2025年流动性多资产ETF的严格前向测试中，MARCD表现优于标准分配器，2020-2025年样本外测试中夏普比率1.23(基准1.02)，最大回撤9.3%(基准14.1%)，减少34%，夏普提升在5%水平显著。

Conclusion: MARCD提供了一个从尾部忠实场景建模到受治理投资组合决策的可复现桥梁，显著改善了回撤控制，并提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the
decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE
denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD
offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed
portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

Method: 基于梯度符号结构的关键洞察，提出GradFix方法：计算目标模型的少量梯度，据此掩码源任务向量，生成与目标损失地形局部对齐的更新。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中取得显著性能提升，一致优于朴素任务向量加法和少样本微调。

Conclusion: 梯度符号结构是任务向量成功迁移的关键，GradFix方法通过局部对齐实现有效知识迁移，并具有一阶下降的理论保证。

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

Motivation: 传统统计套利方法通常分开估计因子和交易策略，无法在考虑交易成本的情况下最大化盈利能力。需要一种联合优化方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 开发注意力因子作为条件潜在因子，从公司特征嵌入中学习复杂交互。使用通用序列模型从因子残差组合中识别时间序列信号，并联合估计因子和套利交易策略。

Result: 在24年美国最大股票数据集上，注意力因子模型实现了超过4的样本外夏普比率。考虑交易成本后的一步解决方案实现了前所未有的2.3夏普比率。

Conclusion: 联合估计因子和交易策略对于在交易成本后最大化盈利能力至关重要，弱因子在套利交易中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

TL;DR: NOvA实验提出了一种点集神经网络，用于处理稀疏的2D探测器数据，通过混合两个视图的信息，在减少90%内存使用的同时，将AUC得分从85.4%提升到96.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用聚类和CNN处理NOvA实验的稀疏2D探测器数据，但内存消耗大且视图间信息独立处理，需要更高效的方法来融合两个视图的信息。

Method: 提出点集神经网络，直接在稀疏矩阵上操作，通过特殊操作混合XZ和YZ两个视图的信息，而不是分别处理。

Result: 模型内存使用减少90%以上，AUC得分达到96.8%，显著高于两个视图独立处理时的85.4%。

Conclusion: 点集神经网络能有效处理NOvA实验的稀疏探测器数据，在显著降低内存需求的同时提高了粒子识别性能。

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种谱各向异性高斯扩散(SAGD)方法，通过引入各向异性噪声算子来构建扩散模型的归纳偏置，用结构化的频率对角协方差替代各向同性前向协方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型(DPMs)虽然取得了强大的生成性能，但其归纳偏置仍然很大程度上是隐式的。本文旨在将归纳偏置显式地构建到扩散模型的训练和采样过程中，以更好地适应数据的目标分布。

Method: 引入各向异性噪声算子，将各向同性前向协方差替换为结构化的频率对角协方差。该算子统一了带通掩码和幂律加权，允许强调或抑制指定的频带，同时保持前向过程的高斯性。推导了各向异性协方差的得分关系。

Result: 在多个视觉数据集上的实验表明，诱导的各向异性性能优于标准扩散模型，并实现了选择性省略：在忽略特定频带中已知的损坏的同时进行学习。

Conclusion: 精心设计的各向异性前向噪声为在DPMs中定制归纳偏置提供了一个简单而有原则的调控手段。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种基于Bode图表示的新损失函数log-B和log-BW，用于电化学阻抗谱数据的等效电路模型拟合，并通过大规模数据集评估了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电化学阻抗谱数据使用等效电路模型进行拟合时，通常通过非线性最小二乘法最小化损失函数来获取参数。本文旨在开发新的损失函数以提高拟合性能。

Method: 使用生成的大规模EIS数据集，评估了提出的log-B和log-BW损失函数与现有损失函数在R2分数、卡方值、计算效率和MAPE等方面的性能。

Result: X2损失函数在多个拟合质量指标上表现最佳，而log-B损失函数虽然拟合质量略低，但计算速度快约1.4倍，且对大多数电路元件产生更低的MAPE。

Conclusion: 当拟合质量是首要目标时，X2损失函数是最佳选择；log-B损失函数作为强有力替代方案，在大规模最小二乘拟合应用中具有优势。

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training
machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SODA的语义凝聚知识蒸馏方案，通过将多标签信息作为新的文本模态，构建跨模态教师网络来学习图像模态的汉明空间，指导学生网络更好地保留图像和文本模态间的语义相似性。

Motivation: 现有深度跨模态哈希方法虽然通过自监督学习语义信息，但多标签语义提取过程未能与原始多模态数据显式交互，导致学习到的表示级语义信息与异构多模态数据不兼容，阻碍了模态间隙的弥合。

Method: 将多标签信息作为新的文本模态，构建标签提示；设计跨模态教师网络在图像和标签模态间蒸馏语义特征，学习图像模态的汉明空间；用该汉明空间作为先验知识指导学生网络学习。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SODA方法通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏有效解决了跨模态哈希中语义信息与多模态数据不兼容的问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理系统将引擎和查询独立处理导致资源效率低下，需要解决跨引擎和查询的KV缓存高效卸载和通信问题。

Method: LMCache提取并存储现代LLM引擎生成的KV缓存，通过优化数据移动（批处理、流水线）、模块化连接器和控制API实现缓存编排。

Result: 与vLLM结合使用时，在不同工作负载下实现了高达15倍的吞吐量提升，并在企业推理系统中得到广泛采用。

Conclusion: LMCache通过高效的KV缓存共享机制显著提升了LLM推理系统的资源利用率和性能，为未来KV缓存解决方案提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries
independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource
inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by
reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by
disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source
code of LMCache is at: https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly
applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation
health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more
robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to
increasing fire risk under climate change.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

Conclusion: C-DPS框架通过耦合扩散过程提供了一种稳定且准确的逆问题求解方法，无需调优约束或近似似然。

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

Conclusion: 提出的RL框架为存在相关预测变量和偏见可能无意重现的环境提供了一种灵活且可推广的特征选择方法。

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的AI工具可以简单有效地改进因果估计，其生成预测的能力优于仅使用嵌入调整的方法。

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential
equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic
design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Method: 通过上下文学习理论框架，在AR(p)数据假设下，对线性自注意力模型进行理论分析，并通过精心设计的实验进行实证验证。

Result: 理论证明：(1)线性自注意力模型无法获得比经典线性模型更低的期望MSE；(2)当上下文长度趋近无穷时，LSA渐近恢复最优线性预测器；(3)在思维链推理下预测指数级坍缩到均值。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer在时间序列预测中的根本理论局限，呼吁研究社区重新审视复杂架构的直接应用，并为设计更有效的预测架构提供实践洞见。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅影响神经网络训练实践，还在关键学习期与热启动神经网络训练研究之间建立了重要联系

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

Conclusion: 自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪是有效的解决方案，能够在联邦学习环境中平衡隐私保护和模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度的训练方法面临梯度消失/爆炸、非光滑激活函数处理困难以及顺序结构限制并行化等问题，需要寻找替代的训练方法。

Method: 采用提升训练策略，将嵌套优化问题转化为高维约束优化问题，利用Bregman距离等凸优化工具，实现分布式优化并适应非光滑近端激活函数。

Result: 数值实验显示，提升Bregman方法在标准成像任务中比传统训练更有效和稳定，特别适用于使用近端激活函数的架构。

Conclusion: 提升训练框架为深度网络训练提供了有前景的替代方案，能够改善训练条件，支持分布式优化，并有效处理非光滑激活函数。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

Motivation: 传统基于网格的PDE求解器在高维情况下成本高昂，而解析解通常难以获得，因此需要开发可扩展的无网格神经求解器。

Method: 采用统一协议比较三种神经PDE求解器：PINNs、DRM和WANs，使用强制边界条件、强制节点和正交正则化，在泊松问题（最高5D）和薛定谔方程上进行测试。

Result: 所有方法在适当配置下都能达到10^-6到10^-9的低L2误差。PINNs在精度和激发谱恢复方面最可靠；DRM在稳态问题上提供最佳精度-运行时权衡；WAN在有效使用弱形式约束时具有竞争力。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and
engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based
solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified
comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks
(WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the
study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the
Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors
($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在神经网络中定义最速下降方法，需要为每层选择规范、跨层聚合规范的方式以及是否使用归一化。现有方法如Adam和Muon在不同规范组合下的表现需要系统研究。

Method: 将Adam和Muon形式化为非欧几里得梯度下降类型，推导Muon优化器的新变体MuonMax，并将其与模型动量(Momo)方法结合。

Result: Muon对学习率选择敏感，而MuonMax显著更鲁棒。与Momo结合的Muon变体对超参数调优更鲁棒，通常获得更好的验证分数。

Conclusion: 对于新任务，当最优超参数未知时，建议使用Momo与MuonMax组合，以节省昂贵的超参数调优成本。

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: Kelp是一个新型的流式风险检测插件框架，通过在语言模型生成过程中实时分析隐藏状态来检测有害内容，相比后处理检测方法具有更高准确性和更低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防护措施多为后处理检测，可能在捕获前暴露不安全内容，且延迟限制迫使其使用轻量级模型，限制了检测准确性。

Method: 提出Kelp框架，利用Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD)建模风险在生成序列中的时间演化，并引入Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC)损失来强制单调的危害预测。

Result: 在多样化模型和数据集上，Kelp持续优于最先进的后处理防护措施和先前的插件探针（平均F1提高15.61%），仅使用20M参数且每token延迟增加小于0.5毫秒。

Conclusion: Kelp提供了一种高效准确的流式内容风险检测方法，显著提升了实时防护能力。

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from
each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text
and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯决策理论为主动学习提供了统一的理论框架，ParBaLS EPIG方法能有效解决大批量采样问题并获得更好性能。

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

Motivation: 随着深度神经网络规模扩大，压缩技术需求增长，但直接应用压缩方法往往导致严重的精度下降。

Method: VCON方法在微调期间并行执行原始模型和压缩模型，逐步减少原始模型的贡献权重，同时增加压缩模型的贡献权重，实现平滑过渡。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，VCON结合多种压缩策略均带来一致改进：典型增益超过3%，某些配置精度提升达20%。

Conclusion: VCON提供了一种可泛化的方法，可应用于现有压缩技术，在多个基准测试中均显示出持续增益。

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稳健损失的泛化误差界不能准确反映样本外性能，且无界假设空间和弱矩假设下标准浓度工具失效，需要新的分析框架。

Method: 使用Tikhonov正则化风险最小化在再生核希尔伯特空间中，引入概率有效假设空间，建立比较定理连接超额稳健风险与L2预测误差，并在重尾噪声下推导误差界。

Result: 建立了新的比较定理，将超额稳健风险与L2预测误差联系起来，残差为O(σ^{-2ε})，阐明了尺度参数σ引起的稳健性-偏差权衡，并推导了Huber回归的显式有限样本误差界和收敛率。

Conclusion: 预测误差而非超额泛化风险是分析稳健学习的基本视角，研究提供了原则性的调参规则，并适用于Huber以外的其他稳健损失函数。

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

*Parsa Gooya,Reinel Sospedra-Alfonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于条件变分自编码器的概率误差校正框架，用于改进北极海冰浓度的季节性预测，能够生成大量调整后的预测集合，提供更好的不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的北极海冰浓度季节性预测系统存在系统性偏差和复杂的时空误差，传统的一对一后处理方法无法充分量化不确定性，而决策制定需要适当的概率信息特别是极端事件的概率。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器模型来映射给定有偏差模型预测条件下观测值的条件分布，这种方法能够自然地生成大量调整后的预测集合。

Result: 调整后的预测在校准性、与观测分布的接近程度以及误差方面都优于基于气候学平均值调整的预测。

Conclusion: 提出的概率误差校正框架能够有效改进北极海冰浓度预测的准确性和不确定性量化，为决策提供更可靠的概率信息。

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

TL;DR: 提出了Chain-of-Influence (CoI)框架，通过构建显式的时间展开特征交互图来建模临床时间序列数据中的潜在依赖关系，提供可解释的预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法显式建模临床变量之间随时间变化的依赖关系传播，黑盒机制或简单聚合限制了模型的可解释性。

Method: 使用多层注意力架构：时间注意力层识别关键时间点，跨特征注意力层建模这些时间点特征对后续特征的定向影响，构建影响路径图。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集和慢性肾病队列上的实验显示，CoI在预测准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能揭示临床上重要的患者特异性疾病进展模式。

Conclusion: CoI框架提供了前所未有的透明度，能够追踪特征影响路径，为临床决策提供可解释的时序和跨特征依赖关系洞察。

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种群体自适应对抗训练策略，通过将对抗性评论分为感知、认知和社会三个心理学类别，利用LLM生成多样化的类别特定攻击，并应用基于Dirichlet的自适应采样机制来动态调整训练重点，从而提升假新闻检测模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的假新闻检测模型在标准设置下表现良好，但对由真实用户或大型语言模型生成的对抗性评论攻击仍然脆弱，这些攻击会微妙地改变模型决策，影响社交媒体平台的信任度。

Method: 1) 将对抗性评论分为三个心理学基础类别：感知、认知和社会；2) 通过LLM生成多样化的类别特定攻击以增强对抗训练；3) 应用基于Dirichlet的自适应采样机制(InfoDirichlet Adjusting Mechanism)在训练过程中动态调整不同评论类别的学习重点。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持强检测准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种对抗性评论扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的群体自适应对抗训练策略有效提升了假新闻检测模型对对抗性评论攻击的防御能力，同时保持了良好的检测性能。

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

TL;DR: AutoGD是一种自动调整学习率的梯度下降方法，无需用户手动调参，能够自动决定何时增加或减少学习率，并在多种优化任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度下降等优化方法的性能高度依赖学习率的选择，但手动调整学习率需要大量用户调参工作，特别是在作为其他算法内循环时，期望用户调参是不现实的。

Method: 提出AutoGD方法，自动判断在给定迭代中应该增加还是减少学习率，无需知道平滑度常数，并扩展到AutoBFGS和AutoLBFGS。

Result: 实验证明AutoGD在传统问题和变分推断优化任务中表现优异，能够恢复GD的最优收敛速率（相差一个常数）。

Conclusion: AutoGD提供了一种实用的自动学习率调整方法，显著减少了用户调参负担，同时保持了良好的收敛性能。

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏统计保证，或依赖于易违反的强假设，需要一种能严格控制FDR的训练数据识别方法

Method: 使用已知未见数据计算每个数据点的p值，构建测试集数据使用比例的保守估计器来缩放p值，然后基于数据依赖阈值选择训练数据集

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上的实验表明，PTDI能严格控制FDR并实现更高的检测能力

Conclusion: PTDI提供了一种具有严格FDR控制保证的训练数据识别方法，显著提升了检测能力

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets
demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

<details>

Motivation: 传统不完全多视图谱聚类需要在特征提取后使用K-means算法生成聚类结果，且未能有效利用样本连通性信息。

Method: 施加非负约束直接获得聚类结果，基于谱聚类结果构建连通性矩阵，最小化基于连通性矩阵的自表示残差，使用乘法更新迭代算法求解。

Result: 在基准数据集上，CRG_IMSC优于现有最先进的聚类方法，实验验证了算法的收敛性。

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC通过直接获得聚类结果和有效利用样本连通性，提升了不完全多视图谱聚类的性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

Result: 开发出隐私友好的联邦k-means算法，仅需要在互联设备间共享聚合信息

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了联邦环境下的k-means聚类，保护了数据隐私

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型路由方法依赖准确的模型表示，添加新模型通常需要重新训练，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）查询嵌入和投影到向量空间，训练投影器和基于LLM的路由器重建查询；2）基于查询和模型性能的上下文向量，路由器学习预测模型是否能正确回答新查询。

Result: 在分布内和分布外任务中均实现了最先进的路由性能，且无需重新训练即可无缝集成新模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文向量有效表示模型能力，显著提升了模型路由的可扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有基于全局Lipschitz连续性或强对偶性的WDRO方法存在上界过松或计算成本过高的问题，需要更紧的鲁棒性证书和更灵活的攻击方法。

Method: 采用原始方法结合精确Lipschitz证书来收紧WDRO上界，提出Wasserstein分布攻击直接构造最坏情况分布，利用ReLU网络在激活单元上的分段仿射结构实现精确可处理表征。

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法在保持竞争性鲁棒精度的同时，比现有方法提供更紧的证书，且WDA在攻击点数量和位置方面更灵活。

Conclusion: 所提出的原始方法和WDA在Wasserstein分布鲁棒优化中实现了更紧的鲁棒性证书和更好的灵活性，为对抗鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: PPOPT通过预训练有效提高了无模型强化学习在小样本环境中的效率和稳定性，为计算资源受限的场景提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel,
model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual
explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing
explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs
or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an
exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in
resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环Transformer在复杂推理任务中表现优于标准Transformer，但其理论优势尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在从损失景观几何的角度解释这一现象。

Method: 扩展River-Valley景观模型，区分U形谷（平坦）和V形谷（陡峭），提出循环Transformer架构诱导了River-V-Valley景观偏置。基于此开发了SHIFT分阶段训练框架。

Result: 理论推导表明，基于V形谷偏置的循环Transformer在损失收敛方面表现更好，能够学习更复杂的模式。SHIFT框架加速了循环Transformer的训练过程并达到可比较的性能。

Conclusion: 循环Transformer在复杂推理任务中的优势源于其诱导的River-V-Valley景观偏置，SHIFT框架有效利用了这种偏置来加速训练。

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

TL;DR: 提出ARROW方法，通过多尺度时间路由和自适应滚动策略改进全球天气预报，解决现有方法在时空依赖建模和误差累积方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的天气预报方法通常基于固定短时间间隔建模，依赖朴素自回归进行长期预测，存在两个关键问题：(1) 无法充分建模全球天气系统的空间和多尺度时间依赖性；(2) 滚动策略难以平衡误差累积与精细大气变化捕捉。

Method: 构建多间隔预测模型，使用共享-私有专家混合机制捕获不同时间尺度的共享模式和特定特征，采用环形位置编码准确表示地球纬度结构，并基于强化学习开发自适应滚动调度器来选择最合适的时间间隔。

Result: 实验结果表明ARROW在全球天气预报中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ARROW为全球天气预报领域建立了一个有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Cyc-Attack方法，通过扰动深度学习天气预报模型的上游预报来生成对抗性热带气旋轨迹，解决了传统攻击方法在非可微分检测系统和类别不平衡问题上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习天气预报模型对对抗攻击的脆弱性，特别是如何通过微小的上游预报扰动来改变下游热带气旋轨迹预测，现有方法在非可微分检测系统和极端稀有事件导致的类别不平衡问题上存在挑战。

Method: 提出Cyc-Attack方法：预训练可微分替代模型近似热带气旋检测器输出；使用偏度感知损失函数和核膨胀策略解决类别不平衡问题；采用基于距离的梯度加权方案和正则化确保扰动物理一致性。

Result: Cyc-Attack能够有效生成对抗性热带气旋轨迹，成功操纵下游预测结果，同时保持生成的对抗性预报的物理合理性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: Cyc-Attack方法克服了传统对抗攻击在天气预报模型中的局限性，为评估深度学习天气预报系统的安全性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了InterCorpRel-LLM框架，结合图神经网络和大型语言模型，用于识别企业间的供应和竞争关系，在供应链关系识别任务上显著优于GPT-5等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别企业间关系对金融分析和公司治理至关重要，但现有方法面临数据规模大、稀疏性和上下文依赖等挑战。图方法缺乏语义深度，而LLMs在关系依赖表示方面有限。

Method: 提出跨模态框架InterCorpRel-LLM，整合GNNs和LLMs，使用FactSet供应链记录构建专有数据集，包含三个定制训练任务：公司图匹配、行业分类和供应关系预测。

Result: 在供应链关系识别任务上，InterCorpRel-LLM显著优于强基线模型（包括GPT-5），F-score达到0.8543 vs 0.2287，仅使用7B参数骨干网络和轻量训练。模型还能零样本泛化到竞争者识别。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析师和策略师提供了强大的工具，用于映射和推理复杂的企业网络，增强动态市场中的决策制定和风险管理能力。

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证词汇假说，探索机器学习是否能替代或改进传统人格模型如Big Five。

Method: 使用经典形容词列表通过机器学习构建人格模型，并在100万条Reddit评论数据上与Big Five模型进行比较分析。

Result: Big Five模型（特别是宜人性、尽责性和神经质）在描述在线社区方面表现更优，机器学习聚类未能提供有意义的区分，未能恢复外向性特质，且缺乏Big Five的心理测量一致性。

Conclusion: Big Five模型具有稳健性，人格的语义结构是情境依赖的，机器学习可以检验现有心理学理论的生态效度，但可能无法替代它们。

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多组均值估计问题，提出探索无关的分配算法，在有限采样预算下获得各组均值的统一准确估计。与经典多臂老虎机不同，该问题需要采样每个组Θ(T)次，因此探索无关算法既自然又有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多组均值估计问题，在有限采样预算下获得所有组均值的统一准确估计。与经典多臂老虎机专注于识别最佳臂不同，该问题需要平衡采样所有组，因此探索无关方法更为合适。

Method: 使用Hanson-Wright不等式加强亚高斯方差集中性结果，识别严格亚高斯分布类别以获得更尖锐保证。设计探索无关的非自适应和自适应算法，并将框架扩展到上下文老虎机设置。

Conclusion: 探索无关分配是多组均值估计的原则性和高效方法，在实验设计、个性化等需要准确多组推断的领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在标签噪声和数据分布偏移下不可靠，因为不确定性、多样性等启发式方法会放大错误标签或冗余样本的影响。

Method: 使用两种互补信号：类均值对齐扰动评分（量化样本对类间几何结构的影响）和特征波动评分（捕捉训练过程中表示的时间不稳定性），结合这些信号选择能保持类别分离并突出模糊区域的样本。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和CIFAR100上的实验表明，NCAL-R在合成标签噪声下具有更高准确率、更强鲁棒性，并能更好地泛化到分布外数据。

Conclusion: 将几何可靠性标准纳入主动学习采集决策可以减少对标注错误和分布偏移的脆弱性，是实现真实世界标注管道中可信部署的关键步骤。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

Motivation: 解决强化学习中由于数据序列性破坏独立性假设而难以获得泛化保证的挑战。

Method: 推导了考虑马尔可夫依赖性的PAC-Bayesian泛化界，并设计了PB-SAC算法在训练过程中优化该界来指导探索。

Result: 在连续控制任务上的实验表明，该方法提供了有意义的置信证书，同时保持了竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的泛化界为非策略算法提供了非平凡的泛化保证，PB-SAC算法在实践中有效利用了这些保证来指导探索。

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide
exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach
provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive
performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的非线性上下文赌博机算法在理论分析和实际应用方面存在局限性，需要开发既具有理论保证又实用的随机探索方法。

Method: 通过最大似然估计在随机扰动数据上维护多个奖励模型参数估计器，开发了GLM-ES和Neural-ES两种集成采样算法，并提出了无需固定时间范围的随时版本。

Result: 证明了GLM-ES的遗憾界为O(d³/²√T + d⁹/²)，Neural-ES的遗憾界为O(˜d√T)，与最先进的随机探索算法结果相匹配。实验验证了算法的强大性能。

Conclusion: 集成采样为非线性上下文赌博机提供了一种可证明且实用的随机探索方法，在理论和实践上都表现出色。

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach
for nonlinear contextual bandits.

Experiments reveal it surpasses text only methods, producing outputs with
greater fidelity and alignment with human written standards. Its incorporation
of visual data allows it to better represent intricate design features and

Method: 提出了一个原则性的理论框架，将分数估计误差分解为统计、近似、优化和裁剪四个组成部分。

Result: 获得了离散状态扩散模型的第一个样本复杂度界限 $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$。

Conclusion: 该分析填补了文献中的基本空白，确立了离散状态扩散模型的理论可处理性和实际相关性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the
sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively
studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models,
essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial
structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于CLIP风格对比目标的多模态方法容易过拟合到易于对齐的特征，并将有效的跨模态关系误分类为负样本，导致碎片化和不可泛化的嵌入表示。

Conclusion: ProtoMM通过共享原型提供了一种生理信号的"共同语言"，改进了学习特征的可解释性，并实现了更好的多模态时间序列建模。

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model
with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and
prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while
offering improved interpretability of learned features.

Result: 该方法在隐私保护方面与DP-SGD等经典方法相当，但在测试准确率等效用指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: 梯度唯一性提供了一种直观的隐私审计方式，能够有效平衡隐私保护与模型效用。

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

Motivation: 扩展经典信息论到有限结构化系统，重新定义冗余作为信息组织的基本属性，而非传统通信理论中的低效概念。

Conclusion: 冗余是可测量和可调节的量，连接了通信的渐近世界和学习的有限世界，在结构化系统中达到稳定性和泛化能力的平衡。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

Motivation: 尽管Transformer被广泛使用，但其训练过程可能不稳定。Layer Normalization作为标准组件能改善稳定性，但其放置位置往往缺乏理论依据，需要系统研究。

Method: 通过理论分析推导了训练Transformer中隐藏状态增长的前向稳定性界限，以及Layer Normalization对梯度反向传播影响的后向稳定性分析，并指导残差连接步长的缩放。

Result: 理论分析揭示了不同Layer Normalization放置位置对应的训练动态，数值结果验证了理论发现，合适的残差步长缩放能进一步提升稳定性和性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为检验新架构修改下Transformer的稳定性提供了原则性方法，为未来设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate
our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a
principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new
architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

TL;DR: 该论文通过几何任务中的原子间势能学习实证研究表明，等变性架构比非等变性模型具有更好的缩放特性，且高阶表示对应更好的缩放指数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究等变性在更大规模下对学习性能的影响，验证对称性等基本归纳偏置在模型缩放中的重要性。

Method: 在原子间势能学习的几何任务中进行实证研究，分析不同架构（等变与非等变）在数据、参数和计算方面的缩放行为。

Result: 发现等变性架构比非等变性模型缩放更好，高阶表示对应更好的缩放指数；计算最优训练时，数据与模型大小应同步缩放。

Conclusion: 不应让模型自行发现对称性等基本归纳偏置，特别是在大规模场景下，因为这些偏置会改变任务固有难度和缩放规律。

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

Motivation: RLVR训练中常出现策略熵崩溃问题，导致策略过于确定性化，阻碍探索并限制推理性能。传统的固定系数熵正则化方法效果不稳定，难以适应不同任务和模型的需求。

Method: 提出自适应熵正则化(AER)框架，包含三个组件：难度感知系数分配、初始锚定目标熵和动态全局系数调整，动态平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AER始终优于基线方法，显著提高了推理准确性和探索能力。

Conclusion: 自适应熵正则化能有效解决RLVR训练中的策略熵崩溃问题，通过动态调整熵正则化系数来适应不同难度任务的需求，提升大语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

Motivation: 在许多科学和工程应用中，计算前向模型导数在计算和实际应用上都很困难，因此需要无导数的贝叶斯反演方法。

Method: Blade利用基于扩散模型的数据驱动先验，通过交互粒子集合进行贝叶斯反演，能够处理仅允许黑盒访问的非线性前向模型。

Result: 理论上建立了非渐近收敛分析来表征前向模型和先验估计误差的影响；实证上，Blade在各种反问题（包括高度非线性流体动力学）上优于现有无导数贝叶斯反演方法。

Conclusion: Blade能够为贝叶斯反演产生准确且校准良好的后验分布，特别适用于处理非线性前向模型且无需导数计算的应用场景。

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

Conclusion: 为理解Barlow Twins有效性提供严格理论基础，为分析SSL算法提供新的几何视角

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: 该研究为更安全的智能体系统提供了实用模板，通过填补数据、模型和评估三个关键空白，实现了在规划阶段的有效风险防范。

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

TL;DR: 该论文首次理论分析了批量大小对Adam优化器泛化性能的影响，发现在过参数化CNN中，小批量Adam/AdamW能实现接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本会收敛到较差的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要分析Adam的全批量版本，但实际使用的是随机版本，且随机Adam即使学习率无限小也不会收敛到全批量对应版本，需要研究批量大小对Adam泛化的影响。

Method: 理论分析两层级过参数化CNN在图像数据上的表现，比较Adam和AdamW在不同批量大小下的泛化性能，并推导有效权重衰减边界。

Result: 小批量Adam/AdamW能实现接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本收敛到较差的测试误差解。Adam的有效权重衰减边界严格小于AdamW，解释了为什么Adam需要更敏感的λ调优。

Conclusion: 批量大小和权重衰减在Adam的泛化性能中起关键作用，小批量训练能显著改善Adam的泛化能力，且Adam比AdamW对权重衰减超参数更敏感。

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

Motivation: 股票价格预测具有挑战性，因为金融市场具有波动性和非线性特征。尽管深度学习有潜力，但GANs在应用中存在模式崩溃、训练不稳定以及难以捕捉时间和特征层面相关性等问题。

Method: 使用GRU-based编码器-解码器GAN框架，包含带残差连接的时间解码器进行精确重构，基于静态和动态协变量进行条件学习，以及窗口机制捕捉时间动态。生成器采用带残差GRU块的密集编码器-解码器框架。

Conclusion: EDGAN模型在表达能力和简洁性之间取得了平衡，为股票价格预测提供了一种有效的解决方案，特别是在波动市场条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在RLHF微调时，训练使用随机SDE采样器以鼓励探索，而推理使用确定性ODE采样器以提高效率和稳定性，这种不匹配会导致奖励差距，影响推理阶段的输出质量。

Method: 采用广义去噪扩散隐式模型(gDDIM)框架支持任意高水平的随机性，保持数据边际分布；通过理论分析给出奖励差距的非空边界，并对VE和VP高斯模型提供更尖锐的收敛率。

Result: 大规模文本到图像模型实验（使用DDPO和MixGRPO）验证了奖励差距在训练过程中持续缩小，且当使用更高随机性的SDE训练更新模型时，ODE采样质量得到改善。

Conclusion: 训练与推理采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距问题可以通过理论分析和适当的训练策略得到有效缓解，使用更高随机性的训练方法能够提升推理阶段的采样质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional

events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

Method: 提出了一个理论分析框架，研究从包含短和长链式思维序列的混合分布中学习。在奇偶性预测任务上，理论证明了强化学习训练后自回归变换器能够泛化，而仅使用下一个词预测需要极端的统计或计算资源。同时在线性模型的简化设置中进行了理论证明。

Result: 理论分析表明，只要数据混合中长演示的比例在输入维度d上不是指数级小的，自回归线性模型就能有效学习预测d位的奇偶性。在Llama系列模型上的实验也验证了相同现象。

Conclusion: 强化学习训练能够利用测试时更长的计算（表现为更长的响应）来促进学习过程，这种机制使得模型在处理罕见长序列时比单纯的下一个词预测方法表现更好。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

Result: 实证表明该方法在决策质量上持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 扩散DFL方法能有效处理不确定性，提升决策质量，且提供了高效的计算方案。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

### [425] [Causality $\neq$ Decodability, and Vice Versa: Lessons from Interpreting Counting ViTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09794)
*Lianghuan Huang,Yingshan Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现，在视觉Transformer中，信息的可解码性和因果性存在系统性不匹配：中间层的对象token具有强因果影响但弱可解码性，而最终层的对象token支持准确解码但在功能上惰性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机制可解释性研究面临的一个持续挑战是区分两个常被混淆的概念：可解码性（从隐藏状态恢复信息的能力）和因果性（这些状态对输出的功能影响程度）。

Method: 使用激活修补技术测试空间和CLS token的因果作用，通过移植干净-损坏图像对之间的激活；同时训练线性探针评估不同深度计数信息的可解码性。

Result: 发现中间层对象token具有强因果影响但弱可解码性，最终层对象token支持准确解码但功能惰性；CLS token在中间层可解码但仅在最终层获得因果能力。

Conclusion: 可解码性和因果性反映了表征的互补维度——存在什么信息与使用什么信息——它们的分歧可以揭示隐藏的计算电路。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

Motivation: 研究随机过程诱导的流，以找到更容易积分的传输方法，特别是那些产生直线流的过程，这些流可以通过一阶方法精确积分。

Method: 通过分析随机过程的条件期望和速度，推导出描述直线流的PDE特征，研究仿射时间插值和端点耦合条件。

Result: 发现直线流仅在确定性端点耦合下发生，并推导了约束流几何的必要条件，为设计更容易积分的传输提供了指导。

Conclusion: 论文为动态度量传输的生成建模提供了理论框架，明确了产生直线流的条件，有助于设计更高效的积分方法。

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续时间动力系统中存在的近奇异行为和数值不稳定性问题，特别是在处理刚性和湍流过程时，为物理信息神经网络和其他潜在流架构提供稳定化方法。

Method: 引入平滑单调映射t↦τ(t)进行时间重参数化，在提升坐标系中使轨迹变得全局光滑，同时保持系统的守恒定律。

Result: 该方法能够使不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程在环面T^3上的轨迹变得全局光滑，并能够稳定物理信息神经网络和潜在流架构。

Conclusion: 时间提升框架将解析正则性理论与表示学习方法联系起来，为处理刚性和湍流过程提供了一种有效的连续时间归一化方法。

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

TL;DR: 本文研究了乐观Hedge算法在两人零和博弈中的遗憾最优性，改进了社交和个体遗憾上界至O(√(log m log n))，并证明了这些上界无法进一步改进，包括常数因子匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乐观Hedge算法在强非耦合学习动态中的遗憾依赖性的最优性，现有遗憾上界为O(log(mn))，但可能不是最优的。

Method: 通过将遗憾上界表示为关于学习率和某些负项系数的优化问题，进行精细化分析；提供算法依赖的个体遗憾下界来证明上界的最优性。

Result: 在强非耦合设置下，社交和个体遗憾上界改进为O(√(log m log n))，且这些上界无法进一步改进，上下界常数因子完全匹配。

Conclusion: 乐观Hedge算法的遗憾上界已达到最优，基于这些结果还改进了最后迭代收敛率和动态遗憾，并提供了匹配的动态遗憾下界。

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

TL;DR: Decomposer Networks (DecompNet) 是一种语义自编码器，通过并行分支和残差输入分解输入信号为多个可解释组件，采用类Gauss-Seidel的块坐标下降方法实现组件间的显式竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自编码器将输入压缩为单一潜在表示，而DecompNet旨在将输入分解为多个语义可解释的组件，提供更丰富的表示形式。

Method: 使用N个并行分支，每个分支处理原始信号减去其他分支重构的残差，通过展开Gauss-Seidel风格的块坐标下降为可微分网络，实现组件间的显式竞争。

Result: 模型能够产生简洁且语义有意义的表示，是首个实现"全除一"残差更新规则的语义自编码器。

Conclusion: DecompNet在分解可解释组件方面具有创新性，为语义自编码提供了新方法，与线性分解方法和对象中心架构形成对比。

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功结合了摊销采样和粒子方法的优势，通过神经序列采样器和SMC的协同作用，在复杂分布采样任务中取得了更好的性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在无法确定因果方向、仅限于线性关联、对忠实性假设敏感以及搜索效率低等问题，而大语言模型虽然具备强大推理能力，但不适合处理表格数据。

Method: 采用基于Mamba的架构，整合局部因果评分、条件独立性检验和关系属性等多种证据，训练数据包括合成数据（线性、混合、非线性模型）和10个真实生物数据集。

Result: CALM在模拟研究中准确率超过91%，在识别丙型肝炎病毒进展的因果因素等真实应用中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过成功将语言模型的模式识别能力应用于表格数据的复杂性，为准确且可泛化的因果发现迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields
like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However,
existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and
score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These
include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

Motivation: 现有的参数化路由器需要重新训练和维护开销，非参数化路由器虽然免训练但难以泛化到异常查询，且训练集多样性有限且更新成本高。

Method: 采用指数倾斜聚合机制来平衡非参数化路由器中的偏差和方差，提高对异常查询的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明ProxRouter在增强异常查询路由的同时，以最小开销保持了正常查询的性能。

Conclusion: ProxRouter通过平衡偏差和方差的方法，有效解决了非参数化路由器在异常查询上的泛化问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

Motivation: 训练网页代理需要掌握子任务（如日期选择器操作、滚动容器等），但现有基准未能充分评估这些能力。

Method: 使用Web ARChive文件创建沙盒化的动态网页交互环境，采用监督微调(SFT)和带可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)来训练模型。

Result: 领先的计算机使用模型在WARC-Bench上的最高成功率仅为64.8%。SFT模型达到48.8%成功率，RLVR在SFT基础上提升至52.8%，超过许多前沿模型。

Conclusion: 掌握网页子任务对于鲁棒的网页规划和导航至关重要，这是现有基准未能充分评估的能力。

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to
master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI
components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a
container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，TAWRMAC在动态链接预测和节点分类任务中，在转导和归纳设置下均优于现有最先进方法，且对三种不同负采样策略都具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TAWRMAC通过提供稳定、可泛化且上下文感知的嵌入，推进了连续时间动态图学习的技术水平，在多种任务和设置下表现优异。

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at

TL;DR: T2J是一个提示增强框架，通过构建包含常见错误和修复的固定错误数据集，为轻量级LLM提供结构化指导，显著提升PyTorch到JAX的代码翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PyTorch和JAX虽然都嵌入在Python中，但在核心设计、执行语义和生态系统成熟度上存在差异。JAX较新且在公共代码中代表性不足，平行PyTorch-JAX语料库有限，现有评估方法在跨框架基准测试中存在弱点。

Method: 构建两阶段流程：(1)使用GPT-4o-mini从TorchLeet和CodeParrot的PyTorch源代码生成初始JAX草稿；(2)专业开发者迭代修复这些草稿，构建包含常见错误和修复的固定错误数据集；(3)构建增强提示，为轻量级LLM提供结构化指导。

Result: T2J将GPT-4o-mini在CodeBLEU上的性能提升高达10%，T2J修复成本分数提升50%，T2J代码翻译分数提升1.33分（0-4分制），T2J比较分数提升100%。生成的代码运行速度比基线快2.5倍。

Conclusion: T2J框架通过结构化指导和专业修复数据集，显著提升了PyTorch到JAX的代码翻译质量，解决了跨框架代码翻译中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable

biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In
this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based

therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In
targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved
binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art
generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules
designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease

Abstract: Excess alcohol consumption leads to serious health risks and severe
consequences for both individuals and their communities. To advocate for
healthier drinking habits, we introduce a groundbreaking mobile smartwatch
application approach to just-in-time interventions for intoxication warnings.
In this work, we have created a dataset gathering TAC, accelerometer,
gyroscope, and heart rate data from the participants during a period of three
weeks. This is the first study to combine accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart
rate smartwatch data collected over an extended monitoring period to classify
intoxication levels. Previous research had used limited smartphone motion data
and conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify heavy drinking
episodes; in this work, we use smartwatch data and perform a thorough
evaluation of different state-of-the-art classifiers such as the Transformer,
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU),
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN), and Hyperdimensional
Computing (HDC). We have compared performance metrics for the algorithms and
assessed their efficiency on resource-constrained environments like mobile
hardware. The HDC model achieved the best balance between accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating its practicality for smartwatch-based applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探索了复值卷积神经网络在音频信号处理中的应用，重点研究如何保留和利用实值网络通常忽略的相位信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实值神经网络在处理音频信号时经常忽略相位信息，而复值网络能够更好地保留和利用这些信息，提升音频处理任务的性能。

Method: 提出复值CNN的理论框架，包括复卷积、池化层、Wirtinger微分和复值激活函数，并采用复批量归一化和权重初始化技术确保训练稳定性。通过三个阶段进行实证评估：图像数据集基准测试、基于MFCC的音频分类、以及使用GNN建模相位信息的实验。

Result: 复值CNN在图像数据集上表现与实值CNN相当；在音频分类中，基于实值MFCC的复值CNN略优于实值CNN；通过GNN建模相位信息在流派分类任务中取得了可衡量的性能提升。

Conclusion: 复值架构具有强大的表达能力，相位信息是音频处理中有意义且可利用的特征。虽然当前方法（特别是cardioid激活函数）显示出潜力，但未来需要开发更多相位感知设计来充分发挥复值表示的潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

*Ching Chang,Ming-Chih Lo,Chiao-Tung Chan,Wen-Chih Peng,Tien-Fu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemPromptTSS是一个用于迭代多粒度时间序列分割的框架，通过引入持久提示记忆来解决现有方法中提示影响快速衰减的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时间序列分割提示方法只在局部上下文中操作，提示的影响很快消失，无法在整个序列中指导预测。需要一种能够使提示影响持久化的方法。

Method: 提出MemPromptTSS框架，使用记忆编码器将提示及其周围子序列转换为存储在记忆库中的记忆标记，使每个新预测不仅基于局部线索，还基于所有累积的提示。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验表明，MemPromptTSS在单次迭代推理中比最佳基线在单粒度和多粒度分割上分别提升23%和85%的准确率，在迭代推理中每轮平均增益为2.66个百分点。

Conclusion: 持久记忆对于提示引导的分割至关重要，MemPromptTSS为实际应用提供了一个实用有效的框架。

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SQS-SD框架，通过结构化稀疏化和格基量化来压缩边缘设备生成的草稿令牌分布，以解决边缘-云推测解码中的带宽限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘-云推测解码中，边缘设备与云端之间的有限带宽限制了草稿令牌分布的传输效率，需要有效的压缩方法。

Method: 提出SQS-SD框架，利用分布稀疏性进行结构化稀疏化和格基量化。包括固定top-K截断的K-SQS和通过在线符合预测自适应调整保留令牌集的C-SQS。

Result: 两种方法在互补的操作机制下都改善了端到端延迟和拒绝率。

Conclusion: SQS-SD框架通过利用分布稀疏性有效解决了边缘-云推测解码中的带宽瓶颈问题，K-SQS和C-SQS在不同场景下都能提升性能。

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)算法，用于在线强化学习微调基于流匹配的视觉-语言-动作模型，解决了传统策略梯度方法在流匹配模型中的计算不可行性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型如OpenVLA、Octo和π₀虽然通过大规模演示数据展现了良好的泛化能力，但其性能仍受限于监督数据的质量和覆盖范围。强化学习提供了通过在线交互改进这些模型的途径，但传统策略梯度方法在流匹配模型中由于重要性采样过程难以计算而不可行。

Method: FPO算法通过利用条件流匹配目标中每个样本的变化来重新定义重要性采样，并集成了结构感知信用分配、裁剪代理目标、多步潜在探索和Q集成机制，实现了稳定可扩展的在线强化微调。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和ALOHA模拟任务中，FPO相比监督学习、偏好对齐、基于扩散的方法、自回归在线RL和π₀-FAST基线方法，都取得了持续改进，在稀疏奖励下实现了稳定学习。

Conclusion: FPO算法成功解决了流匹配模型在线强化学习中的计算挑战，通过创新的重要性采样方法和多种稳定化技术，实现了对视觉-语言-动作模型的有效微调，消融研究验证了各组件对算法性能的贡献。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖标注数据进行监督训练，要么只能检测极端异常，无法有效识别细微的语义偏离异常，以捕捉新状态或意外程序的开始。

Method: 基于矩阵轮廓的无监督异常检测算法，捕捉制造周期相似性并进行语义分割，精确识别增材制造中缺陷异常的起始点。

Result: 在真实世界传感器数据上的实验证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别增材制造过程中的语义偏离异常，为在线过程监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeminiNet提出了一种统一神经网络方法，从函数调用图(FCG)和进程调用图(PCG)中学习联合嵌入，通过双图卷积分支和自适应门控机制平衡静态和动态视图的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多只关注单一类型的图表示，而函数调用图和进程交互图的联合建模尚未充分探索，这为软件系统的多视角分析提供了机会。

Method: 构建FCG和PCG的训练流程，使用Ghidra提取FCG，Any.Run沙箱提取PCG，采用双图卷积分支和自适应门控机制学习联合嵌入。

Result: 在635个Windows可执行文件数据集上，联合嵌入模型优于单图模型。

Conclusion: GeminiNet通过联合建模静态和动态图表示，为软件行为分析提供了更全面的多视角理解。

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among
functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they
can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG识别模型由于数据集特定约束和个体变异性，在跨范式泛化方面表现不佳，需要开发更鲁棒的架构。

Method: 提出BITE端到端统一架构，包含对齐的时频流、金字塔时频注意力机制和双向自适应卷积，实现多尺度特征增强和双向神经动态建模。

Result: 在四个不同范式数据集上达到最先进性能，在个体内精度和跨个体泛化方面表现优异，兼具计算效率。

Conclusion: 范式对齐的频谱-时间处理对于可靠BCI系统至关重要，BITE验证了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm
generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid
Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream
synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive
convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency
streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional
modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical
neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance
across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our
work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential
for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of
EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

TL;DR: STAT是一种新的微调策略，利用更强LLM的元认知能力作为教师，通过分析学生模型的缺失技能档案来创建针对性的训练数据，显著提升数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调在训练数据与预训练数据相似时往往效果有限（饱和现象），需要更有效的技能针对性训练方法。

Method: STAT方法：教师模型创建任务所需技能列表并标注数据点技能需求，通过监控学生回答构建缺失技能档案，然后通过STAT-Sel（重加权现有训练样本）或STAT-Syn（合成缺失技能相关样本）构建改进的训练集。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上，STAT在MATH数据集上提升达7.5%，在分布外基准（AIME24/25、AMC23等）上平均提升4.6%，且与GRPO强化学习方法互补。

Conclusion: 技能导向的自适应训练应广泛改进当前训练流程，STAT方法能有效解决模型技能差距问题。

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 所提出的分层优化框架成功解决了无人机视觉问答任务中的延迟和功耗优化问题，为低空经济网络中的实时多模态推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

Conclusion: FOSSIL是一个可推广、数据高效且可解释的框架，适用于医学影像中数据稀缺情况下的难度感知学习。

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization
via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting
framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for
difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

Result: O4M-SP在不同箱子尺寸上成功泛化，显著优于基线方法，有效处理带稳定性约束的装箱场景。

Conclusion: O4M-SP框架在3D装箱问题中表现出强大的实用性和泛化能力，特别适合实际物流和仓储应用。

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

Motivation: 自注意力能自适应识别相关元素但依赖绝对位置嵌入进行结构表示学习，卷积能以相对方式编码元素但其固定核大小限制了自适应选择相关元素的能力。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出Translution操作，统一自注意力的自适应识别能力和卷积的相对编码优势。为解决参数过多问题，进一步提出轻量级变体α-Translution。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务上的实验表明，Translution（包括α-Translution）相比自注意力实现了更高的准确率。

Conclusion: Translution成功结合了自注意力和卷积的优势，在保持高效计算的同时获得了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM)
domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain
capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional
trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform
expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在时间序列分类中表现出色，但它们可能依赖训练数据中的虚假相关性，这种捷径行为在时间序列领域尚未得到充分研究。现有研究多关注外部属性而非时间序列模型内部偏差行为。

Method: 提出了一种基于其他类别的简单检测方法，用于检测捷径学习行为，该方法不需要测试数据或干净的训练类别。

Result: 在UCR时间序列数据集上测试了所提出的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解深度学习时间序列分类中的捷径学习行为提供了初步探索，并提出了有效的检测方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过着色算法将图神经网络的表达能力和泛化能力联系起来，证明更强的表达能力会导致更高的Rademacher复杂度，从而削弱泛化保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释图神经网络中表达能力与泛化能力之间的权衡现象：虽然表达能力更强的GNN能区分更多图结构，但通常泛化误差更高。

Method: 通过WL着色算法，分析着色诱导的等价类数量如何限制GNN的Rademacher复杂度，建立表达能力和泛化能力之间的理论联系。

Result: 证明表达能力越强，Rademacher复杂度越高，泛化保证越弱；同时证明Rademacher复杂度在不同样本的着色计数扰动下是稳定的。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了GNN表达能力和泛化能力的研究，为理解表达能力增强往往以泛化能力为代价提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

*Guilin Li,Yun Zhang,Xiuyuan Chen,Chengqi Li,Bo Wang,Linghe Kong,Wenjia Wang,Weiran Huang,Matthias Hwai Yong Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PANTHER是一个混合生成-判别框架，通过生成式预训练学习用户行为表示，在微信支付中实现了25.6%的下一次交易预测准确率提升和38.6%的欺诈检测召回率相对改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能封装广泛的世界知识，但在建模用户交互历史中的行为知识方面存在局限。用户行为构成独特模态，每个动作包含时间、上下文等多维属性，建模这些高基数序列具有挑战性。

Method: 提出PANTHER框架，包含：结构化标记化压缩多维交易属性；序列模式识别模块建模周期性交易模式；统一用户画像嵌入融合静态人口统计和动态交易历史；通过离线缓存预训练嵌入实现实时可扩展性。

Result: 在微信支付中部署，相比基线方法，下一次交易预测HitRate@1提升25.6%，欺诈检测召回率相对改进38.6%。在公共基准测试中，相比transformer基线实现高达21%的HitRate@1增益。

Conclusion: PANTHER是一个可扩展、高性能的工业级序列用户行为建模框架，展示了生成式预训练在用户行为建模中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can
distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs
encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lighter-X是一个高效的图神经网络推荐框架，通过压缩稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵，将参数复杂度从O(n×d)降低到O(h×d)，显著减少参数数量和计算复杂度，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的推荐系统（如LightGCN）需要为每个节点维护大小为d的嵌入，导致参数复杂度为O(n×d)，在大规模图应用中面临可扩展性挑战。

Method: 分析原始结构和参数冗余，提出稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵的高效压缩方案，采用解耦框架优化模型训练过程。

Result: 在大规模交互图上，仅使用LightGCN 1%的参数就能达到相当甚至更好的性能。

Conclusion: Lighter-X是一个高效且模块化的框架，能够显著减少参数大小和计算复杂度，同时保持理论保证和实证性能，实现大规模实际部署。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

TL;DR: 提出了一种偏好驱动的知识蒸馏框架，结合LLMs和GNNs的优势进行少样本节点分类，通过GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器和节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器实现高效知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs依赖人工标注标签且难以处理复杂多样的局部拓扑结构，LLMs在少样本学习上表现良好但存在扩展性问题，需要结合两者的互补优势。

Method: 开发了GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器促进LLMs到教师GNNs的预测蒸馏，以及节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器为每个节点选择最合适的教师GNN进行定制化知识蒸馏。

Result: 在真实世界文本属性图的少样本节点分类任务上进行了广泛实验，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的偏好驱动知识蒸馏框架成功结合了LLMs和GNNs的互补优势，在少样本节点分类任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

*Bin Yang,Qiuyu Leng,Jun Zeng,Zhenhua Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CacheClip是一个解决RAG系统中TTFT瓶颈的新框架，通过辅助小模型识别关键token来选择性重计算KV缓存，在保持94.8%性能的同时实现1.92倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存复用方法在RAG场景中存在根本性权衡：前缀缓存需要相同前缀但RAG中很少出现，直接预计算会因缺少跨块注意力和重复注意力sink而牺牲质量。

Method: 集成三种技术：辅助模型引导的token选择、共享前缀消除冗余注意力sink、分组策略保持局部一致性。辅助模型经过微调以提高选择准确性。

Result: 在NIAH和LongBench上分别保持94.8%和85.0%的全注意力性能，比APE和CacheBlend在NIAH上提升25.2%和35.1%。预填充时间加速达1.92倍。

Conclusion: CacheClip为RAG系统中的效率-质量权衡提供了实用解决方案，实现了快速TTFT和高生成质量的平衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

TL;DR: PermLLM提出了一种可学习的通道置换方法，通过Sinkhorn归一化将离散置换矩阵转换为可微的软置换矩阵，实现端到端优化，显著提升了N:M稀疏模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通道置换方法依赖手工设计的质量指标，往往无法准确捕捉剪枝对模型性能的真实影响，需要更智能的优化方法。

Method: 提出可学习通道置换(LCP)，使用Sinkhorn归一化处理离散置换矩阵；采用高效的块级通道置换策略减少可学习参数和计算复杂度；与现有一次性剪枝方法无缝集成。

Result: 在LLaMA系列、Qwen和OPT模型上的广泛实验表明，PermLLM在优化N:M稀疏模型方面实现了卓越性能。

Conclusion: PermLLM通过可学习的通道置换有效缓解了剪枝引起的误差，为N:M稀疏模型提供了更优的优化方案。

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

Conclusion: FIRE提供了一个统一的频域分解框架，能够实现可解释且鲁棒的时间序列预测，在性能和可解释性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

Conclusion: STEER通过直接控制token级熵变化，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为RLVR训练提供了更稳定的熵动态管理方案。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for
function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data
imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By
embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently
captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued
models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in
Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse
domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological
data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer
parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and
efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in
resource-constrained and data-scarce environments.

attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

TL;DR: GraphBFN是一个基于贝叶斯流网络的分子图生成框架，通过引入累积分布函数统一训练目标与采样舍入操作，解决了现有连续扩散模型在训练与推理阶段不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的连续扩散模型在训练时预测连续数值（回归任务），但在推理时需要舍入操作转换为离散类别（分类操作），这种训练与推理的不一致导致模型过度关注点对点精度，限制了分子多样性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出了GraphBFN，一个基于贝叶斯流网络的分层从粗到细框架，在分布参数上操作。通过创新性地引入累积分布函数，能够计算选择正确类别的概率，从而统一训练目标与采样舍入操作。

Result: 在QM9和ZINC250k分子图生成基准测试中取得了优越的性能和更快的生成速度，创造了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: GraphBFN通过统一训练与推理过程，有效解决了连续扩散模型在分子图生成中的根本限制，提升了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

*Xuening Wu,Shenqin Yin,Yanlan Kang,Xinhang Zhang,Qianya Xu,Zeping Chen,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了统计哥德尔机（SGM），这是第一个用于递归编辑的统计安全层，用统计置信度测试取代基于证明的要求，在选定的置信水平下仅当改进被证明时才允许修改，同时分配全局错误预算来限制多轮累积风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归自修改在AutoML、神经架构搜索和自适应优化中日益重要，但现有框架无法确保此类更改的安全性。哥德尔机通过要求在重写代码前提供形式化改进证明来提供原则性保障，但在随机高维设置中此类证明无法获得。

Method: 引入统计哥德尔机（SGM），用统计置信度测试（e值、Hoeffding界）替代基于证明的要求；提出确认触发谐波支出（CTHS）方法，通过确认事件而非轮次来索引支出，将错误预算集中在有希望的编辑上同时保持族有效性。

Result: 在监督学习、强化学习和黑盒优化的实验中验证了SGM的作用：在CIFAR-100上认证了真实增益，在ImageNet-100上拒绝了虚假改进，在RL和优化基准测试中展示了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些结果将SGM定位为学习系统中持续、风险感知自修改的基础设施。

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式尺度卷积网络（PSCNet），结合ERA5-Land高时间分辨率数据，将低分辨率SMAP土壤水分产品降尺度到10公里空间分辨率和3小时时间分辨率，在青藏高原地区取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决土壤水分时间尺度反演中因地表辅助因子不完整而受阻的问题，通过引入高时间分辨率ERA5-Land变量来改进低分辨率SMAP产品的降尺度过程。

Method: 设计了PSCNet网络，包含多频时间融合模块（MFTF）捕捉时间动态，以及定制的挤压激励（SE）块保留细粒度空间细节，实现渐进式尺度卷积。

Result: 在青藏高原2016-2018年的验证中：1）卫星产品验证R值0.881，优于其他方法；2）站点验证在所有站点R指标均排名前三；3）时间泛化验证相对误差控制在6%以内；4）时间动态和可视化验证显示优异的时间敏感性和空间细节。

Conclusion: PSCNet通过有效建模土壤水分数据中复杂的时空关系，为时空降尺度提供了一个有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

Conclusion: MPPReasoner显著提升了分子性质预测的性能、可解释性和实用性，为化学家提供了有价值的分子性质分析见解。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials
science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor
cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities.
Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while
specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their
decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose
\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates
chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to
enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning
trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models,
followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical
principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency
through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional
cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that
provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially
enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists. Code is

TL;DR: 提出基于持续学习的框架，通过按问题规模递增的顺序训练深度模型来解决车辆路径问题的泛化能力限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度模型通常针对单一规模问题进行训练和评估，这严重限制了它们在不同问题规模间的泛化能力，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 采用持续学习框架，按问题规模递增顺序训练模型；设计任务间正则化保留小规模知识，任务内正则化模仿最新行为，并利用经验回放缓解灾难性遗忘。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在各种问题规模（包括训练中未见过的规模）上均优于现有最先进的深度模型，包括专门用于增强泛化能力的模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的持续学习框架能有效提升车辆路径问题深度模型在不同规模间的泛化能力，消融研究验证了关键设计的协同效应。

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key
designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

*Nikolaus Salvatore,Hao Wang,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs在长文本中表现出'中间信息丢失'现象，这与人类记忆的首因效应和近因效应类似。研究发现这不是简单的信息丢失缺陷，而是预训练中不同信息检索需求适应的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在长文本中信息检索性能下降的原因，特别是中间信息丢失现象，并理解其与人类记忆效应的相似性。

Method: 从零开始训练GPT-2和Llama变体模型，使用模拟人类长期和短期记忆需求的简单范式，分析序列完成任务。

Result: 模型在训练中确实出现了U形性能曲线，近因效应与短期记忆需求直接对应，首因效应由长期记忆需求诱导，并受自回归特性和注意力汇聚影响。

Conclusion: 信息检索需求、模型架构和训练过程中的结构注意力动态共同导致了LLMs中观察到的位置偏差。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle"
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学基准测试主要评估知识回忆，而真实的临床推理是假设驱动的迭代过程，需要从有限信息中逐步完善诊断。

Method: 构建1762个医生策划的临床案例，模拟医学口试场景，要求LLM代理主动探查相关信息、选择适当检查，并通过多步骤合成信息达到诊断。

Result: 当前LLM在完整临床描述下诊断能力良好，但在迭代诊断推理中表现显著下降，出现四种常见认知错误模式。

Conclusion: VivaBench为评估对话式医学AI系统提供了标准化基准，揭示了当前LLM在不确定性下推理决策的基本局限性。

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

Motivation: 语言模型智能体在新环境中学习效率低，交互成本高，现有架构未能充分利用语言模型生成和推理完整反事实轨迹的能力。

Method: ECHO包含两个组件：事后规则（识别相关子目标并生成优化轨迹）和更新规则（维护压缩的轨迹表示）。

Result: 在XMiniGrid和PeopleJoinQA基准测试中，ECHO比基础语言模型智能体性能提升高达80%，在XMiniGrid中优于Reflexion和AWM等复杂架构。

Conclusion: ECHO通过更有效地利用过去经验，实现了在陌生环境中更快的适应能力。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在稠密图（如点云、分子相互作用）上效率低下，常用的稀疏化方法会丢失多尺度信息，需要一种能同时捕捉局部和长程交互的方法。

Method: 引入多视图图元组框架，将图划分为不相交子图，使用受非交换算子理论启发的异构消息传递架构学习多视图表示。

Result: 在分子属性预测和宇宙学参数推断两个应用上，多视图图元组模型均优于单图基线模型。

Conclusion: 多视图图元组方法在保持表达力的同时提高了GNN在稠密图上的性能，证明了多视图方法的强大和通用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

Motivation: 抗抑郁药物不依从现象普遍，导致复发、住院、自杀风险增加和巨额成本。现有方法要么侵入性强，要么基于代理指标不准确，需要能及时检测依从性问题的工具

Method: 基于Transformer的模型分析来自消费级可穿戴设备或非接触式无线传感器的睡眠数据，推断抗抑郁药物摄入情况

Result: 在6个数据集（62,000个夜晚，>20,000名参与者，1,800名抗抑郁药物使用者）中，生物标志物AUROC达到0.84，跨药物类别泛化良好，与剂量呈比例关系，对伴随精神药物保持稳健

Conclusion: 该方法提供客观、可扩展的依从性监测，有潜力改善抑郁症护理和预后

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,
suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that
detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive
(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,
pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects
antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model
analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to
infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence
assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000
participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world
initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable
adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

TL;DR: NMF-LAB是一种新的监督学习框架，将分类问题重新定义为非负矩阵三因子分解的逆问题，直接分解标签矩阵，无需外部分类器即可获得类别概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非负矩阵分解是无监督的，无法直接利用类别标签。现有的监督扩展方法通常通过惩罚项或图约束结合标签，但仍需要外部分类器。

Method: 将分类问题重新定义为非负矩阵三因子分解的逆问题，直接分解标签矩阵Y，将协变量A作为已知解释变量，获得从协变量到标签的直接概率映射。

Result: 在从小规模基准数据集到大规模MNIST数据集上的实验表明，NMF-LAB实现了有竞争力的预测准确性，对噪声或不完整标签具有鲁棒性，可扩展到高维问题，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过在tri-NMF框架内统一回归和分类，NMF-LAB为现代分类任务提供了一种新颖、概率化和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图生成中缺乏对期望属性的控制，导致质量不稳定且难以融入新目标。推理时引导方法虽然无需重新训练，但本质上仍是局部、启发式且可控性有限。

Method: 提出TreeDiff框架，包含三个关键设计：(1)宏步扩展策略，将多个去噪更新分组为单次转移，减少树深度；(2)双空间去噪机制，结合潜在空间高效去噪和图空间轻量离散校正；(3)双空间验证器，从部分去噪图中预测长期奖励，无需完整展开。

Result: 在2D和3D分子生成基准测试中，无论是无条件还是有条件设置，TreeDiff均达到最先进性能。推理时间扩展性优异，随着计算资源增加持续改进，而现有方法在有限资源下早期即达到平台期。

Conclusion: TreeDiff通过MCTS引导的双空间扩散框架，实现了高效可控的图生成，在质量和可控性方面均优于现有方法，且具有良好的计算扩展性。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

*Sara Dragutinović,Andrew M. Saxe,Aaditya K. Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了transformer在分类任务中的上下文学习机制，发现即使使用softmax非线性激活，transformer仍能通过梯度下降在上下文学习，但学习过程发生在核特征空间中且具有上下文自适应学习率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要基于简化的线性自注意力和连续回归任务，而transformer通常在离散复杂任务上训练。本文旨在弥合这一差距，研究在分类任务和非线性softmax激活下的上下文学习机制。

Method: 通过理论分析和经验验证，研究transformer在分类任务中使用softmax激活时的上下文学习算法，并与线性注意力模型进行对比。

Result: 发现softmax transformer在上下文学习中执行梯度下降，但学习过程发生在核特征空间中，且具有上下文自适应学习率，表现出比线性注意力更强的上下文适应性。

Conclusion: 这项研究增强了在更现实设置下对上下文学习算法的理论理解，为向更大模型的理论拓展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

TL;DR: 提出HiLoMoE框架，结合垂直和水平扩展的优势，通过分层LoRA MoE实现参数高效的整体扩展，在CTR预测任务中实现更好的性能-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CTR预测中垂直扩展的序列计算效率问题和水平扩展的MoE层难以捕捉推荐任务层次结构的问题，探索两种扩展方向的互补优势。

Method: 使用轻量级rank-1专家进行参数高效的水平扩展，堆叠多个MoE层并通过分层路由实现组合多样的专家组合，基于前层分数而非输出进行并行路由。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上，相比非MoE基线，平均AUC提升0.20%，FLOPs减少18.5%，实现了更好的性能-效率权衡。

Conclusion: HiLoMoE框架成功结合了垂直和水平扩展的优势，在参数高效的前提下实现了CTR预测任务的整体扩展和性能提升。

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

Motivation: 现有多任务学习框架未能考虑阿尔茨海默病数据中特征相关性的时变特性，限制了模型性能。

Method: 引入特征相似性拉普拉斯惩罚项，同时考虑任务间的时间平滑性和特征间的动态相关性，使用ADMM算法求解非光滑优化问题。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验表明，MTL-FSL框架实现了最先进的性能，优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: MTL-FSL框架通过建模特征间时变相关性，显著提升了阿尔茨海默病预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了反向监督策略的计算复杂性，指出即使有量子计算等加速技术，监督学习仍然需要人类提供初始标签和先验知识。生成式AI可以作为标签放大器，但需要人类监督来确保质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在计算能力极大提升的背景下，监督学习是否仍然需要人类参与。探讨生成式AI能否完全替代人类标注工作。

Method: 分析反向监督策略的计算复杂性，该策略在大型未标注数据集上搜索标签分配以最小化小型标注数据集的误差。

Result: 发现搜索空间为2^n，即使有常数倍加速，复杂度仍为指数级。计算速度提升只能减少运行时间，不能消除对初始监督的需求。

Conclusion: 极端计算速度无法替代监督学习的基本需求，人类（或人类级）的初始输入仍然是必要的，生成式AI只能作为标签放大器在人类监督下工作。

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Conclusion: 该方法能够预测新实验环境中的反事实行为，支持多个体建模进行灵活的假设轨迹生成，有望用于模拟和阐明复杂的多动物行为。

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential
to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

Motivation: 现有方法普遍使用共享嵌入层处理所有通道，造成表示瓶颈，模糊了有价值的通道特定信息。

Method: 引入共享-辅助嵌入(SAE)框架，将嵌入分解为捕获共同模式的共享基础组件和建模独特偏差的通道特定辅助组件，并基于观察到的低秩和聚类特性设计参数高效的LightSAE模块。

Result: 在9个物联网数据集和4个骨干架构上的广泛实验表明，LightSAE仅增加4.0%参数即可实现高达22.8%的MSE改进。

Conclusion: LightSAE框架有效解决了多变量时间序列预测中的表示瓶颈问题，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型部署面临内存和延迟瓶颈，需要灵活平衡精度和效率的量化技术。现有方法需要支持运行时根据约束动态选择精度。

Method: 扩展Binary-Coded Quantization(BCQ)，将权重表示为二进制位平面和缩放因子，支持位平面级计算和渐进精度扩展机制。

Result: 在低比特位(如2位)显著减少精度损失，在高精度保持竞争力，相比半精度实现3.0倍吞吐量提升，比现有多精度方法提升1.2倍。

Conclusion: AnyBCQ通过算法灵活性与硬件效率的对齐，为多精度LLM部署提供了实用基础，支持多样化的服务级别目标。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

*Zhijian Zhou,Liuhua Peng,Xunye Tian,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于锚点的最大差异(AMD)方法，用于相对相似性测试，通过同时学习假设和核函数来解决传统方法中核选择与假设指定顺序的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于核的相对相似性测试方法存在核选择与假设指定顺序的问题：一旦假设被指定，总能找到使该假设被拒绝的核函数，这使得相对相似性测试在假设指定后选择合适核函数时变得不明确。

Method: 提出锚点最大差异(AMD)方法，在深度核空间中定义相对相似性为(U,P)和(U,Q)距离的最大差异。测试分为两个阶段：第一阶段估计AMD并推断潜在假设，第二阶段评估潜在假设的统计显著性，提出统一测试框架推导不同可能假设的阈值。

Result: 通过理论验证和基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。代码已公开。

Conclusion: 通过同时学习假设和核函数，AMD方法有效解决了相对相似性测试中的核选择挑战，提供了一种更合理的测试框架。

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

Motivation: 传统PINNs存在精度有限、训练动态缓慢、缺乏标签数据以及多物理场交互处理不足等挑战，需要改进方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用梯度增强自训练PINN方法，引入基于梯度的伪点自学习算法，在无标签数据情况下通过伪点生成和自训练机制提升性能。

Result: 在三种不同类型PDE问题上的实验表明，gST-PINN比标准PINN表现更好，Burgers方程和扩散-吸附方程的MSE分别达到10^-5量级，显示出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: gST-PINN方法在无标签数据情况下显著优于标准PINN，能够有效解决低精度和收敛问题，泛化了PINN和gPINN方法。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

Conclusion: 结构化推理显著提升了LLM规划器的性能，Align2Act能够有效将LLM转化为与人类驾驶行为对齐的可解释运动规划器。

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

Conclusion: f-influence框架解决了训练随机性导致的影响力估计不稳定问题，为机器学习模型的数据清理和调试提供了可靠工具

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics
while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for
high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods:
noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling,
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution

### [490] [Reinforced Domain Selection for Continuous Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10530)
*Hanbing Liu,Huaze Tang,Yanru Wu,Yang Li,Xiao-Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合强化学习和特征解耦的框架，用于在无监督连续域自适应中自动选择最优域转移路径，通过无监督奖励机制提升预测准确性和域选择效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续域自适应方法在缺乏明确元数据时难以有效选择中间域，这限制了域自适应在现实场景中的应用。

Method: 使用强化学习进行域路径选择，结合特征解耦技术，利用潜在域嵌入距离设计无监督奖励机制，同时对齐域不变特征以促进域适应。

Result: 在Rotated MNIST和ADNI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在预测准确性和域选择效率方面显著优于传统连续域自适应方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过集成强化学习和特征解耦，能够同时优化转移路径和目标任务性能，有效提升了无监督连续域自适应的效果。

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 当前强化学习基准无法有效评估大语言模型的进展，作者提出了Oracle性能差距指标和诊断套件来量化这一问题，并建议设计更可靠的基准应遵循三个核心原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习基准无法可靠区分模型性能的真正进步，因为训练集和测试集上的表现几乎相同，这掩盖了模型在泛化能力方面的真实缺陷。

Method: 引入诊断套件和Oracle性能差距(OPG)指标来量化训练集与测试集之间的性能差异，并通过压力测试分析模型在分布偏移、难度变化和反事实场景下的泛化能力。

Result: 研究发现尽管现有RL方法在基准测试中得分很高，但在分布偏移、不同难度级别和反事实场景下泛化能力很差，这些缺陷被当前基准所掩盖。

Conclusion: 当前基准不足以评估泛化能力，建议设计更可靠的基准应遵循三个核心原则：足够的难度、平衡的评估和分布鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

*Weiming Zhao,Xulong Wang,Jun Qi,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MFAM模型，通过频率分解模块和注意力多实例学习框架，解决帕金森病严重程度评估中特征特异性不足和时间稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用时间序列模型缺乏病理特异性特征提取能力，且帕金森病症状的时间稀疏性导致关键诊断特征被传统聚合方法稀释，影响评估准确性。

Method: 使用频率分解模块结合医学先验知识增强特征特异性，引入基于注意力的多实例学习框架自适应关注最具诊断价值的稀疏片段。

Result: 在公开PADS数据集和私有数据集上的实验表明，MFAM在处理复杂临床时间序列方面优于通用时间序列模型。

Conclusion: MFAM为帕金森病严重程度的自动化评估提供了一个有前景的解决方案，能够有效处理临床时间序列的复杂性和特异性需求。

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary
classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time
series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity,
providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦学习和去中心化学习的新算法框架，通过建模任务关系为高斯马尔可夫随机场，联合学习任务关系和局部模型，在异构数据分布下实现更优的个性化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于共识的联邦和去中心化学习策略在异构本地数据或任务分布下统计上不最优，现有方法要么需要精确的先验任务关系知识，要么完全非参数化，需要在这两个极端之间找到平衡。

Method: 通过将任务关系建模为具有未知精度矩阵的高斯马尔可夫随机场，开发了一种联合学习任务关系和局部模型的策略，使代理能够以与其个体数据分布一致的方式自组织。

Result: 理论分析量化了学习关系的质量，数值实验证明了其实际有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在异构数据分布下实现了更优的个性化联邦学习，平衡了先验知识和非参数方法之间的权衡。

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: 本文为自监督表示学习提供了理论框架，解释了对比损失的原理，并通过平衡机制改进了算法性能，所有理论证明和代码均已提供。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show
how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices
in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of
balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are
provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary
material.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于组合对称性的智能体框架，将自然数据流建模为有限参数李伪群在低维流形上的局部作用，并证明准确的世界跟踪需要结构约束（等变性）和动力学约束（守恒量、不变流形）。


<details>

Motivation: 从算法视角理解智能体如何压缩感知流，利用组合对称性作为结构先验来解释自然数据流的规律性。

Method: 将智能体建模为与对称数据流耦合的神经动力系统，分析结构约束（等变方程）和动力学约束（Noether守恒量、不变流形），连接Spencer形式体系并提出基于对称性的预测编码框架。

Conclusion: 组合对称性为智能体的世界建模提供了理论基础，通过对称性约束实现高效的数据压缩和层次化表示学习。

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG脑机接口面临数据稀缺和显著的个体间差异问题，这限制了EEG解码模型在实际应用中的泛化能力和适用性。

Method: 通过特征匹配融合模块整合跨试验的特征，结合轻量级特征提取和重建流程，确保在有限数据约束下的数据多样性和可训练性。

Result: 在多个公开EEG数据集上的广泛实验表明，FusionGen显著优于现有的数据增强技术，在分类准确率上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: FusionGen框架通过解耦表示学习和特征融合有效解决了EEG数据稀缺问题，为脑机接口的实际应用提供了更好的数据支持。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建学习模型时经常需要评估大量中间模型（如特征选择、模型结构搜索、参数调优等），这些评估结果会影响后续的模型探索决策。虽然先验知识可以提供初始质量估计，但真实性能只有在评估后才能揭示。

Method: 将中间模型探索问题形式化为Lipschitz空间中未知值函数的一般预算分配问题。

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体结果。

Conclusion: 本文解决了在有限预算下最优分配资源来探索中间模型空间的挑战。

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate
models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model
structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value
functions within a Lipschitz space.

Conclusion: SDG-L框架能够有效利用电池状态时间序列数据，提供准确的容量预测，提升系统效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

TL;DR: ImpMIA是一种基于神经网络隐式偏置的白盒成员推理攻击方法，无需依赖参考模型，在仅知道模型权重和训练数据超集的现实场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的黑盒成员推理攻击方法依赖不现实的假设：攻击者知道训练超参数、非训练样本与训练数据同分布、评估集中训练数据比例已知。移除这些假设会导致性能显著下降。

Method: 基于最大间隔隐式偏置理论，利用KKT最优性条件识别训练样本，通过寻找梯度最能重构模型参数的样本来实现攻击。

Result: 在仅能获取模型权重和训练数据超集的现实设置中，ImpMIA相比黑盒和白盒攻击方法都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ImpMIA通过利用神经网络的隐式偏置，摆脱了对参考模型及其假设的依赖，在现实场景中实现了高效的成员推理攻击。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构表示方法面临SE(3)流形复杂性、离散标记化或多训练目标等挑战，这些因素阻碍了模型优化和泛化能力。

Method: 使用具有瓶颈设计的非等变扩散变换器，通过单一流匹配目标进行端到端训练，将蛋白质主干坐标从E(3)映射到连续紧凑潜在空间。

Result: ProteinAE实现了最先进的重建质量，优于现有自编码器；其潜在空间为潜在扩散模型提供了强大基础，无需显式等变性即可实现高效高质量结构生成。

Conclusion: ProteinAE通过简化的优化流程克服了现有方法的局限性，在蛋白质结构表示和生成方面表现出色，为蛋白质科学提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful
foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit
equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is
competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly
outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to
improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in
uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly
unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

TL;DR: 提出Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs)方法，通过渐进深度扩展训练策略，为不同复杂度数据集自动选择最优网络深度，显著减少模型大小和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在相对简单数据集上训练时存在的模型过大、计算需求高、内存占用多的问题，使模型更适合资源受限设备部署。

Method: 采用类似神经架构搜索的训练策略——渐进深度扩展，从较浅深度开始训练，随着早期模块收敛逐步增加网络深度，直到达到目标精度，仅保留最优深度。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN数据集上，ResNet-18和ResNet-34的最优深度分别实现了98.64%和96.44%的内存占用减少，同时保持99.31%和96.08%的竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: ODNs方法能够根据数据集复杂度自动确定最优网络深度，显著降低训练和推理成本，提高计算效率，便于在边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

Result: 在公开数据集上优于现有股票预测模型，特别是在COVID-19期间表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OmniGNN通过创新的行业节点设计和多关系建模，有效解决了宏观经济冲击下的消息传播问题，提升了股票预测性能。

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating
strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

Conclusion: AEGIS框架能够高效识别最优掩码配置，在保护隐私的同时保持数据效用，适用于原始数据因隐私限制而无法访问的场景。

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

Conclusion: 自适应、节点感知的GNN-LLM架构具有重要价值，选择性调用LLM可在不增加高计算成本的情况下实现大规模图上的可扩展部署。

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

Conclusion: 图异配性度与GNNs的平均频率响应之间不存在严格的单调相关性，需要自适应图滤波器来保证良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Conclusion: 集成长期时间和频率表示与自适应融合为时间序列异常检测提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

TL;DR: 该研究使用社会健康决定因素预测认知表现，基于墨西哥健康与老龄化研究数据，通过SVD插补和XGBoost模型实现了高精度的认知评分预测，并识别出地板材料等关键影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的早期检测至关重要，因为其神经退行性效应不可逆转，且神经病理和社会行为风险因素在诊断前多年就已累积。早期识别高风险个体有助于预防、及时护理和公平资源分配。

Method: 使用基于奇异值分解的插补管道分别处理连续和分类变量的缺失值，利用潜在特征相关性恢复缺失值。评估多种方法后选择XGBoost进行预测建模。

Result: 该框架优于现有方法和数据挑战排行榜，表现出高准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性。SHAP后验分析识别出地板材料、年龄、社会经济地位、生活方式、社会互动、睡眠、压力和BMI等关键影响因素。

Conclusion: 研究证明了社会健康决定因素在认知老化中的多因素性质，以及可解释、数据驱动的SDOH建模的价值，特别强调了地板材料作为社会经济和环境差异反映的重要性。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables
separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover
missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the
data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and
interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH
factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged
as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.
Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,
stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and
the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

TL;DR: MC#是一个结合静态量化和动态专家剪枝的框架，通过PMQ优化位分配和OTP动态选择专家子集，实现MoE模型的高效压缩部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE模型中专家模块带来的显著计算和内存开销问题，这些模块是模型大小和推理成本的主要贡献者。

Method: 结合Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization (PMQ)进行静态位宽优化，使用线性编程平衡专家重要性和量化误差；通过Online Top-any Pruning (OTP)使用Gumbel-Softmax采样动态选择专家子集。

Result: 在DeepSeek-VL2上实现6.2倍权重压缩，平均2.57位，五个多模态基准测试仅损失1.7%准确率；OTP减少20%以上专家激活，性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: MC#通过静态位宽优化和动态路由的协同，实现了极端压缩且保持最小精度损失，为基于MoE的模型部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%
accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces
expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation,
demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

Motivation: 传统的Bradley-Terry奖励模型在处理相似偏好响应时区分能力不足，容易过拟合简单样本，且在分布外样本上泛化能力差，导致对齐效果不理想。

Method: 提出基于语义相似度和模型预测奖励差异的自适应边界机制，从分布角度通过最优传输理论设计成本矩阵，动态调整模型对挑战性样本的关注。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个基准测试中优于现有奖励模型技术，在分布内和分布外设置下均表现出更好的性能、收敛速度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过自适应边界机制增强的奖励模型能够更好地捕捉选择与拒绝响应之间的分布差异，有效提升大语言模型与人类偏好的对齐效果。

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in
performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our
practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our

TL;DR: 4-bit量化对于推理模型并非最优选择，KV缓存而非模型大小主导内存使用。研究发现存在规模依赖的权衡：8B参数以下的小模型应优先分配内存给权重，而大模型应优先给更长的生成序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理模型的内存优化策略，发现4-bit量化的通用方案在推理模型中失效，需要针对不同规模模型制定不同策略。

Method: 在AIME25和GPQA-Diamond数据集上进行1700个推理场景的系统实验，分析不同规模模型在内存分配上的权衡。

Result: 发现8B参数是临界点：小模型（<8B）通过分配更多内存给权重获得更好精度，大模型通过分配内存给更长生成序列获得更好精度。

Conclusion: 推理模型的部署优化需要与非推理模型完全不同的策略，必须考虑规模依赖性，小模型优先模型容量，大模型优先推理时计算资源。

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有方法要么扰动数据使其不可学习，要么重新训练模型抑制迁移，但都无法控制未知模型的推理，且通常需要控制训练过程。需要一种能平衡效用与保护、在模型层面进行控制的机制。

Method: 在模型特定的低敏感子空间内重新编码输入，利用子空间不对齐来保持授权模型输出，同时降低非授权模型性能。基于Hoffman-Wielandt不等式建立理论边界。

Result: 经验验证显示NEs在多种视觉骨干网络和最先进的视觉语言模型中保持性能，而非目标模型即使尝试重建也会性能崩溃。

Conclusion: NEs是一种实用的方法，既能保持预期数据效用，又能防止未经授权的利用，为模型级别的使用控制提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

Result: 在真实世界应用中，InstructUE在用户预测、营销和推荐等多个领域显著优于现有方法，能够有效实现特定场景下的指令引导去噪。

Conclusion: 指令感知的用户建模能够有效实现用户信息的指令引导去噪，为更通用和鲁棒的用户表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user
representation learning.

<details>

Motivation: 现有核心集选择算法主要关注清洁准确率，无法有效保持对抗鲁棒性，需要从数据中心视角理解哪些样本对学习鲁棒特征最关键

Method: 将样本的对抗脆弱性与其硬度关联，用AIGN量化样本难度，选择低AIGN的简单样本构建核心集进行训练

Result: EasyCore在标准训练和TRADES对抗训练下，相比现有核心集方法分别实现了7%和5%的对抗准确率提升

Conclusion: AIGN是模型无关的数据集属性，EasyCore是一种高效且广泛适用的数据中心方法，可显著改善对抗鲁棒性

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

Motivation: 现有保形预测方法分别应用于多元时间序列和静态图，但要么忽略图拓扑结构，要么忽视时间动态性，需要开发能同时处理图结构和时间动态的预测不确定性量化方法。

Method: 开发基于保形预测的序列预测区域框架，利用图结构捕获节点间成对依赖关系，提供用户指定的覆盖保证。

Result: 理论证明相比图无关方法，该方法能使椭球预测集体积指数级缩小；实证显示在保持期望覆盖的同时，预测区域比现有方法显著减小（最多减少80%）。

Conclusion: 该不确定性量化框架成功结合图结构和时间动态，在保证预测可靠性的同时大幅提高了预测精度。

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成过程中会累积误差，特别是在应用任意引导时，这会破坏样本保真度，出现离流形现象。

Result: TAG能持续产生与期望流形紧密对齐的样本，在各种下游任务中显著改善生成质量。

Conclusion: TAG是一种通用解决方案，能有效解决扩散模型中的离流形问题，提升引导生成的质量和保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Motivation: 当前XMC方法主要依赖FP16-FP32混合精度训练，存在不稳定、内存使用效率低和计算开销大的问题。现有低精度方法通常为分类层保留更高精度，限制了内存节省效果。

Method: 提出ELMO框架，使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型，结合Kahan求和和随机舍入技术，实现全Float8训练。采用梯度融合和分块等内存优化技术。

Result: 在300万个标签的XMC模型上，仅使用6.6 GiB GPU内存，相比优化SOTA方法Renee所需的39.7 GiB显著降低，且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: ELMO证明XMC模型可以有效地在全Float8精度下训练，无需依赖单精度主权重或张量缩放，实现了显著的内存节省。

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

Motivation: 不同提示具有不同的复杂度，需要不同的计算资源分配，而现有方法对所有提示分配相同计算预算效率低下。

Method: 利用模型不确定性，通过token-wise熵分布来识别高熵token，只在需要时分支到多个推理路径，并重新分配节省的计算预算。

Result: 在AIME 2025等复杂推理基准上，EAGer无需访问目标标签即可重新分配预算，在推理长度和Pass@k方面达到最佳效率-性能平衡。有目标标签时，可减少65% token生成并提升37% Pass@k。

Conclusion: EAGer通过基于熵的动态计算分配，有效提升了推理模型的效率和性能，实现了更好的计算资源利用。

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

Conclusion: AT-GRPO在多智能体强化学习方面取得了显著进展，为复杂任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to
7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向边缘设备的单实例测试时自适应方法TED，使用CMA-ES在潜在主子空间进行前向坐标优化，无需反向传播，计算复杂度降低63倍，在ZYNQ-7020平台上成功部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备计算资源有限且面临分布偏移，现有TTA方法依赖梯度优化或批处理，不适合资源受限的边缘场景。梯度自由替代方案存在学习能力有限、灵活性不足或架构约束等问题。

Method: 使用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)在潜在主子空间进行前向坐标优化，通过更新紧凑的低维向量来增强输出置信度并使潜在表示更接近源潜在分布，模型参数保持冻结。

Result: 在ImageNet和Google Speech Commands数据集上的实验表明，TED达到最先进性能，计算复杂度降低高达63倍，并在ZYNQ-7020平台上成功部署。

Conclusion: TED为边缘设备提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够在实际边缘应用中实现高效、无遗忘的自适应，具有最小的内存和计算开销。

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge
devices in real-world deployments.

*Gareth Seneque,Lap-Hang Ho,Nafise Erfanian Saeedi,Jeffrey Molendijk,Ariel Kupermann,Tim Elson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ENIGMA是一种新颖的LLM训练方法，通过将组织政策视为信息流形上的方向来联合改进推理、对齐和鲁棒性。该方法结合了GRPO强化学习、SAMI信息辅助和Sinkhorn正则化，无需奖励模型即可实现原则性推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM训练中推理、对齐和鲁棒性通常是分开处理的，作者假设这些是单一信息几何目标的不同投影，希望通过统一的信息几何方法同时改进这些能力。

Method: 使用单循环训练器结合：1) GRPO强化学习方法（仅使用CoT格式奖励）；2) SAMI风格的对称InfoNCE辅助；3) 隐藏状态分布上的Sinkhorn最优传输正则化；4) 引入infoNCE指标和充分性指数来选择优化原则。

Result: 在1B参数LLM上的实验显示，高SI原则预测了更稳定的训练动态和更好的基准性能。信息几何分析验证了流形上的理想结构变化。

Conclusion: ENIGMA支持了推理、对齐和鲁棒性是单一信息几何目标投影的假设，无需奖励模型即可实现原则性推理，为可信能力提供了路径。

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CDRL4AD方法，通过因果解缠表示学习来检测多元时间序列中的异常并识别其因果关系，在准确性和根因分析方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列中变量间的动态交互使得因果关系解释复杂化，现有方法无法明确推断不同时间段的因果关系。

Method: 设计时间异构图和因果关系作为模型输入，通过表示学习识别不同时间段的因果关系并解缠潜在变量以推断因果因素。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，CDRL4AD在准确性和根因分析方面优于最先进方法，并通过案例研究验证了其在辅助专家诊断异常根因方面的有效性。

Conclusion: CDRL4AD成功解决了多元时间序列中因果关系推断的挑战，为异常检测和根因分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate
detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic
interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of
causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

*Yuhang Li,Chenchen Zhang,Ruilin Lv,Ao Liu,Ken Deng,Yuanxing Zhang,Jiaheng Liu,Wiggin Zhou,Bo Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLook是一个基于视觉的强化学习框架，通过多模态大语言模型(MLLM)实现前端代码的生成-诊断-优化闭环，显著提升前端开发能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在算法代码生成方面表现出色，但在前端开发中表现不佳，因为前端代码的正确性需要通过渲染像素和交互来判断。

Method: 采用代理式强化学习框架，将MLLM作为工具进行视觉批评和反馈，引入强制优化规则确保单调改进，在推理时解耦批评器运行轻量级自编辑循环。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试中，ReLook在基于视觉的前端代码生成方面持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: ReLook展示了代理感知、视觉奖励和训练-推理解耦在视觉基础前端代码生成中的显著优势。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhysioME是一个用于处理生理信号中模态缺失问题的鲁棒框架，通过自监督学习、双路径网络和恢复解码器来确保在模态缺失情况下的可靠性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生理信号医疗应用中常因硬件限制或运动伪影导致模态缺失，现有方法假设所有模态都可用，在模态缺失时性能显著下降。

Method: 采用多模态自监督学习（对比学习+掩码预测）、双路径网络主干捕获生理信号时序动态、恢复解码器重建缺失模态令牌。

Result: PhysioME在各种模态缺失场景下实现了高一致性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: PhysioME有潜力成为现实世界数据不完美情况下的可靠临床决策支持工具。

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data
availability.

*Nianyi Lin,Jiajie Zhang,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BGPO算法，通过构建特殊的ELBO下界来解决扩散大语言模型RL训练中的内存瓶颈问题，实现恒定内存使用和更准确的目标估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩散大语言模型的RL训练中，由于需要保留所有蒙特卡洛样本的前向计算图来计算梯度，导致内存开销巨大，限制了样本数量，影响似然估计精度。

Method: 提出边界引导策略优化(BGPO)，构建满足线性和等价性两个关键特性的ELBO下界，使每个项仅依赖单个MC样本，支持梯度累积和恒定内存使用。

Result: 实验表明BGPO在数学问题求解、代码生成和规划任务中显著优于之前的dLLM RL算法。

Conclusion: BGPO通过内存高效的设计解决了dLLM RL训练的关键瓶颈，实现了更准确的似然近似和RL目标估计，提升了性能。

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前依赖大型通用LLM（如GPT-4）作为启发式设计器的范式，证明经过精心微调的专用小型LLM可以生成超越专家手工设计的组件。

Method: 使用多层级课程式奖励函数，逐步引导LLM生成可编译、可执行且性能优越的交叉算子，结合算子缓存机制防止抄袭并促进多样性。

Result: 微调后的LLM生成的交叉算子在HGS求解器中显著优于专家设计的算子，性能优势从1000节点的大规模问题保持一致，超越神经组合基线、提示方法和商业LLM。

Conclusion: 专用小型LLM经过适当微调可以超越大型通用模型，为组合优化问题提供高效的启发式设计解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated
heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current
state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive,
general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by
demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such
as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

TL;DR: QeRL是一个量化增强的强化学习框架，通过结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，加速LLM的RL训练过程并降低内存开销，同时利用量化噪声增强探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL训练LLM需要大量GPU内存和长时间rollout，资源消耗大，限制了模型规模和应用效率。

Method: 结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，引入自适应量化噪声机制动态调整训练过程中的噪声水平。

Result: 在rollout阶段实现1.5倍加速，首次在单张H100 80GB GPU上训练32B LLM，在GSM8K和MATH 500数学基准上分别达到90.8%和77.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: QeRL为LLM的RL训练提供了一个高效且有效的框架，在保持性能的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了MLCM-KD框架，通过双向知识蒸馏解决热成像面部关键点检测中的模态差异问题，实现了高效准确的热成像FLD模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像面部关键点检测在恶劣光照条件下很重要，但缺乏丰富的视觉线索。传统的跨模态方法计算昂贵或产生结构伪影，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出多级跨模态知识蒸馏(MLCM-KD)框架，采用双向注入知识蒸馏(DIKD)机制，不仅用RGB特征指导学生，还将学生表征反馈给教师进行验证，强制学习模态不变特征。

Result: 在公开热成像FLD基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著超越先前方法，同时大幅减少计算开销。

Conclusion: MLCM-KD框架成功解决了RGB和热成像数据间的模态差异问题，实现了鲁棒且高效的知识迁移，为热成像面部关键点检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

TL;DR: TACT是一种测试时适应方法，通过识别和去除表示中的非因果成分来提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型性能在分布偏移下下降的主要原因是模型依赖与预测目标没有直接因果关系的特征。

Method: 使用数据增强保留因果特征同时改变非因果特征，通过主成分分析识别与非因果特征相关的高方差方向，并去除这些方向的投影。

Result: 在真实世界分布外基准测试中，TACT显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过因果修剪方法可以有效提升模型在测试时的适应能力，改善分布偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Conclusion: 通过明确考虑核多样性并平衡多样性与个体测试能力，所提出的方法在多核两样本和独立性测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

Motivation: 现有时间序列异常检测方法缺乏系统的跨领域评估，需要建立统一的评估框架来比较不同方法的性能。

Method: 构建模块化流水线，集成预处理、四种预测模型和四种检测方法，在Numenta异常基准上进行全面评估。

Result: LSTM获得最佳性能（F1: 0.688），在81%数据集上排名前二；Informer提供竞争性精度且训练快30%；经典方法在简单数据上完美预测但真实数据表现较差。

Conclusion: 预测质量主导检测性能，建议根据数据复杂度选择模型：复杂模式用LSTM，效率优先用Informer，简单周期数据用经典方法。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide
evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for

Conclusion: 学习算法是涌现计算的主要决定因素，基于奖励的优化能自主发现复杂的动力学机制，这些机制在直接基于梯度的优化中较难获得。这为设计自适应AI系统提供了机制性见解和可操作原则。

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

Conclusion: 通过集成多个模型的特征重要性可以增强XAI解释的鲁棒性，这对于提高AI系统在现实应用中的可信度至关重要。

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned
protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs,
when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized
models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation
models.

Motivation: 现有机器学习漏洞检测模型只能标记整个源代码函数为易受攻击，无法精确定位具体漏洞代码行，且忽视了数据中的虚假相关性和偏差问题。

Method: 提出检测对齐(DA)方法，通过量化模型预测中最具影响力的输入代码行与真实漏洞位置之间的一致性来评估模型，该方法与模型无关且适用于不同检测任务。

Conclusion: 现有漏洞检测模型存在严重偏差问题，检测对齐方法能有效评估模型定位能力，为改进漏洞检测提供了重要方向。

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,
dynamic constraints. This task is particularly challenging in Graph Neural
Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

Result: 在开源语言模型上的实验表明，NWC在4-6位精度下实现了竞争性或最先进的精度-压缩权衡，准确率几乎与FP16模型相当。

Conclusion: NWC框架为语言模型权重压缩提供了一种有效的学习型方法，在保持模型性能的同时显著减少了存储和传输需求。

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming
increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,
as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good
compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,
trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

Conclusion: 该工作为从信号数据中学习连接图提供了一个原则性框架，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了拓扑和几何结构的恢复性能。

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network
topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global
geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as
synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In
this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法分类准确率与最先进方法相当或更优，同时计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成高质量节点嵌入，在计算效率和分类性能方面都表现出色，适用于缺乏节点特征信息的图数据分类任务。

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning

availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across
various data-scarce environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LouisKV是一个高效的KV缓存检索框架，通过语义感知检索策略和细粒度管理方案，在长序列场景下实现4.7倍加速，同时保持接近无损的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存方法在长序列场景中存在显著的内存开销问题，特别是在长输出推理场景中，由于逐token检索和粗粒度的页面级KV管理，导致效率和准确性瓶颈。

Method: 基于关键KV具有强时间局部性和在输入提示与生成输出中呈现不同分布模式的观察，LouisKV引入了语义感知检索策略（仅在语义边界触发检索）和解耦的细粒度管理方案（为输入和输出序列定制差异化策略），并包含Triton和CUDA内核优化来加速KV聚类和检索。

Result: 评估显示，LouisKV在多样化长序列任务（包括长输入短输出、短输入长输出和长输入长输出场景）中，相比最先进的KV检索方法实现了高达4.7倍的加速，同时保持接近无损的准确性。

Conclusion: LouisKV通过利用KV的时间局部性和分布特性，结合语义感知检索和细粒度管理，有效解决了长序列场景中KV缓存的内存和效率问题，为大型推理模型的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

TL;DR: DiffTSST是一个基于扩散模型的时序数据风格迁移框架，通过卷积编码器将时序数据解耦为内容和风格表示，并使用自监督注意力扩散过程重新组合它们，实现有效的风格迁移和数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉和语言领域风格迁移方法已经很成熟，但时序数据的风格迁移方法仍然有限。时序风格迁移在数据增强和场景模拟等应用中很重要，能帮助机器学习模型在数据稀缺领域泛化。

Method: 使用卷积编码器将时序数据解耦为内容和风格表示，通过自监督注意力扩散过程重新组合这些表示。在推理时，从两个不同的序列中提取内容和风格，实现条件生成以实现风格迁移。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明DiffTSST实现了有效的风格迁移。在数据稀缺情况下，使用DiffTSST进行数据增强可以改善异常检测性能。

Conclusion: DiffTSST是一个有效的时序数据风格迁移框架，在数据增强应用中具有实际价值，特别是在数据稀缺情况下能提升异常检测等任务的性能。

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

TL;DR: 提出了EVP框架，一种事件感知的动态图提示学习方法，可作为现有方法的插件，增强其利用历史事件知识的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态图学习方法主要关注节点与时间的关系，但忽视了历史事件的影响。

Method: 1) 为每个节点提取历史事件序列，引入事件适应机制对齐事件特征与下游任务；2) 提出事件聚合机制将历史知识整合到节点表示中。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上进行了广泛实验来评估和分析EVP。

Conclusion: EVP框架能有效增强现有动态图学习方法对历史事件知识的利用能力。

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

TL;DR: ROLL Flash是一个支持异步强化学习后训练的系统，通过细粒度并行化和rollout-train解耦设计，显著提高了资源利用率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的同步强化学习后训练系统存在资源利用率低和可扩展性有限的问题，需要更高效的训练架构。

Method: 基于细粒度并行化和rollout-train解耦两大核心设计原则，提供灵活的编程接口，支持完全异步训练架构和高效的rollout机制。

Result: 在相同GPU预算下，ROLL Flash在RLVR任务上实现2.24倍加速，在智能体任务上实现2.72倍加速，异步训练性能与同步训练相当。

Conclusion: ROLL Flash通过异步训练架构显著提升了强化学习后训练的效率，同时保持了与同步训练相当的性能表现。

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出多视图特征传播(MFP)框架，通过将特征划分为多个高斯噪声视图进行独立传播，在特征稀疏情况下提升节点分类性能并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图神经网络在节点分类中面临的特征稀疏和隐私泄露问题，传统方法在特征不完整或敏感时性能下降且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 扩展传统特征传播方法，将可用特征划分为多个添加高斯噪声的视图，每个视图通过图拓扑独立传播信息，最后聚合生成鲁棒的节点嵌入。

Result: 在多个图数据集上的实验表明，MFP在节点分类任务上优于现有方法，同时显著减少隐私泄露，传播输出作为替代插补而非原始特征重建。

Conclusion: MFP为具有缺失或敏感特征的图学习领域提供了有效且隐私感知的框架，在保持实用性的同时保护隐私。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

TL;DR: 本研究系统分析了大型语言模型在医学领域的可解释性，通过四种技术探究模型如何表示和处理医学知识，发现了医学知识主要分布在模型前半部分层、年龄编码的非线性特征、疾病进展表示的非单调性等有趣现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在医学领域如何表示和处理知识，为医学任务的微调、遗忘或去偏提供指导，确定在哪些模型层应用这些技术。

Method: 使用四种可解释性技术：(1) UMAP投影中间激活，(2) 基于梯度的权重显著性分析，(3) 层切除/移除，(4) 激活修补。研究了五个LLMs的知识图谱。

Result: 发现医学知识主要在前半部分层处理；年龄编码在中间层呈现非线性；疾病进展表示在某些层呈非单调和循环；药物按医学专科而非作用机制聚类；某些模型中间层激活崩溃但最终层恢复。

Conclusion: 这些结果可为医学任务的LLMs微调、遗忘和去偏提供指导，建议在特定模型层应用这些技术。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large
Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process
medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP
projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with
respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation
patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 十二导联心电图是心脏诊断的金标准但便携性差，三导联系统虽便携但无法检测未测量区域的病理。需要一种方法能够从便携的三导联系统重建完整的十二导联心电图。

Method: 使用变分自编码器（VAE）架构，改进模型以更好地捕捉ECG信号的时空依赖性，从三个导联（II、V1、V5）重建十二导联ECG。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的实验表明，该方法生成生理上真实且具有诊断信息的信号，在下游任务中表现稳健，通过专家图灵测试验证了临床有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了生成模型在ECG重建中的潜力，对可扩展、低成本的心脏筛查具有重要意义。

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

Motivation: 现代学习系统越来越多地依赖摊销学习，但各种方法在编码和利用任务特定信息方面存在差异，缺乏统一的理论框架。

Method: 提出了一个分类框架，将摊销模型分为参数化、隐式和显式三种机制，并引入了迭代摊销推理方法，通过小批量逐步优化解决方案。

Result: 该框架统一了优化基础的元学习和前向传递摊销方法，为解决大规模数据集上的任务适应问题提供了可扩展的基础。

Conclusion: 迭代摊销推理方法结合了随机优化的思想，为通用任务适应提供了更强大和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and
extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了DFTopK，一种新颖的可微分Top-K算子，实现了最优的O(n)时间复杂度，避免了传统方法中的梯度冲突问题，并在推荐系统中显著提升了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联排序在大规模信息检索系统中被广泛采用，但Top-K算子不可微分，阻碍了端到端训练。现有方法存在目标不一致或梯度冲突等问题，且最先进的可微分Top-K算子需要O(n log n)复杂度。

Method: 通过放松归一化约束，DFTopK获得了闭式解并避免了排序操作，实现了线性时间复杂度。该方法绕过了使用软置换矩阵，直接构建了Top-K选择算子的可微分近似。

Result: 在公开基准RecFLow和工业系统上的实验表明，DFTopK显著提高了训练效率并实现了更优性能。在线A/B测试中，在相同计算预算下实现了+1.77%的收入提升。

Conclusion: 这是首次将可微分Top-K算子引入推荐系统，并首次实现了理论最优的线性时间复杂度Top-K选择。该方法已开源以促进学术界和工业界的未来研究。

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整数AI推理显著降低了嵌入式系统的计算复杂度，但量化感知训练仍忽略了整数重新缩放操作的影响，这是整数AI推理中硬件成本较高的操作。

Method: 后训练应用更强的量化到重新缩放乘数，并引入重新缩放感知训练方法进行微调，支持超低比特宽度的重新缩放乘数。

Result: 实验表明，即使重新缩放器宽度减少8倍，通过最小增量重新训练仍能保持完整精度。

Conclusion: 该方法使资源受限的嵌入式系统能够实现更节能和成本效益更高的AI推理。

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在离线RL中存在性能与效率的权衡：扩散策略计算昂贵但性能好，一致性策略快速但性能下降。需要一种能兼顾两者的方法。

Method: 将扩散、流匹配和一致性模型统一视为学习ODE控制的连续时间生成轨迹，提出GTPs学习底层ODE的完整解映射，并引入两个理论驱动的适配方法。

Conclusion: GTPs成功弥合了生成模型在离线RL中的性能-效率差距，为生成策略提供了更清晰的设计空间和统一框架。

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

Result: LightGBM模型结合知识引导特征表现最佳，R²=0.86，MSE=14.99 W m⁻²，MAE=8.82 W m⁻²。知识引导特征对预测蒸散发最为重要。

Conclusion: 成功开发了500米空间分辨率和一天时间分辨率的蒸散发数据产品，与州级气象站估算结果相比具有最佳一致性，为区域蒸散发监测提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图表示学习的多跳问题检索框架，通过多信息级别知识图谱和查询特定的图神经网络来解决多跳问题中的语义理解和噪声干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问题需要识别多个知识目标来合成答案，这对现有的RAG系统提出了挑战。现有方法难以理解复杂语义结构的问题，且在检索多个信息目标时容易受到无关噪声的影响。

Method: 首先构建多信息级别知识图谱(Multi-L KG)来建模不同信息级别，然后设计查询特定的图神经网络(QSGNN)进行表示学习，采用层内/层间消息传递机制，并通过两种合成数据生成策略进行预训练。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在多跳场景下表现有效，特别是在高跳问题中改进可达33.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的图表示学习框架能够有效提升多跳问题检索的性能，特别是在处理复杂语义结构和减少噪声影响方面表现出色。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we
further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the
QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the
improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文指出当前强化学习微调方法在数学推理基准上主要是在优化已有解题模式而非发现新方法，为此提出了MATH-B基准来挑战现有模型，推动探索性强化学习方法的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在数学推理任务上只是优化已有解题模式，未能实现真正的探索和新技能获取，需要新的基准来推动突破。

Method: 构建MATH-B基准，从DAPO-Math-17K和DeepScaleR数据集中选取能击败常见开源模型的问题，即使在大采样预算下也难以解决。

Result: 现有RL微调模型如Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B和DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview在MATH-B基准上表现不佳，验证了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: MATH-B基准将推动探索驱动的强化学习方法发展，激发更深层次的推理能力。

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在语言模型强化学习中引入基于预训练模型隐藏状态的表示多样性奖励，通过刻意探索显著提高了推理任务的多样性和pass@k率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索当前强化学习技术是否真正促进新行为的发现，还是仅仅强化基础模型中已有的行为，研究刻意探索在语言模型中的价值。

Method: 使用基于预训练语言模型隐藏状态的简单、原则性表示多样性奖励，在训练后和推理时两种设置中进行探索。

Result: 表示多样性探索显著提高了多样性和pass@k率，在推理时提高了效率，在训练后改进了推理性能。例如Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct在几乎所有任务上验证器效率提升超过50%。

Conclusion: 刻意探索结合正确的多样性概念是超越简单强化的实用路径，能够发现新行为。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language
models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of
novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

*Edward Stevinson,Lucas Prieto,Melih Barsbey,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出对抗性漏洞源于神经网络中的高效信息编码机制，特别是叠加现象（网络用更少维度表示更多特征），攻击者利用叠加特征间的干扰来生成可预测的攻击模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对对抗样本产生原因存在争议，本文旨在从信息编码角度解释对抗性漏洞，认为这是网络表示压缩的副产品而非学习缺陷。

Method: 在精确控制叠加的合成环境中验证叠加足以产生对抗性漏洞，并在CIFAR-10上训练的ViT模型中验证这些发现。

Result: 证明了对抗性扰动利用叠加特征间的干扰，攻击模式可从特征排列中预测，并解释了模型间攻击可迁移性和类特定漏洞模式。

Conclusion: 对抗性漏洞是网络表示压缩的副产品，而非学习过程缺陷或非鲁棒输入特征的问题。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.
