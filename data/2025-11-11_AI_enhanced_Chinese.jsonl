Historically, research in this field has been dominated by point forecasting methods, which provide single-value predictions but fail to quantify uncertainty. However, as power markets evolve due to renewable integration, smart grids, and regulatory changes, the need for probabilistic forecasting has become more pronounced, offering a more comprehensive approach to risk assessment and market participation. This paper presents a review of probabilistic forecasting methods, tracing their evolution from Bayesian and distribution based approaches, through quantile regression techniques, to recent developments in conformal prediction. Particular emphasis is placed on advancements in probabilistic forecasting, including validity-focused methods which address key limitations in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, this review extends beyond the Day-Ahead Market to include the Intra-Day and Balancing Markets, where forecasting challenges are intensified by higher temporal granularity and real-time operational constraints. We examine state of the art methodologies, key evaluation metrics, and ongoing challenges, such as forecast validity, model selection, and the absence of standardised benchmarks, providing researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive and timely resource for navigating the complexities of modern electricity markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u7535\u529b\u4ef7\u683c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5230\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u6700\u8fd1\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u6db5\u76d6\u65e5\u524d\u3001\u65e5\u5185\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u6700\u65b0\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5173\u6ce8\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3001\u5173\u952e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u65e5\u524d\u3001\u65e5\u5185\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5168\u9762\u53ca\u65f6\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u5931\u7b49\u6301\u7eed\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.\n  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.\n  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.\n  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol.

This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment.

However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "AGRAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u907f\u514dLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u56feRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56feRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1aLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3001\u4ee5\u53caLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u4f53\u63d0\u53d6\u907f\u514d\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u5c06\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684MCMI\u5b50\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u3002", "result": "AGRAG\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u73af\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86NaiveRAG\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AGRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u548cMCMI\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56feRAG\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals.

SMAGDi represents debate traces as directed interaction graphs, where nodes encode intermediate reasoning steps with correctness labels and edges capture continuity and cross-agent influence. The student is trained with a composite objective combining language modeling, graph-based supervision, contrastive reasoning, and embedding alignment to preserve both fluency and structured reasoning. On StrategyQA and MMLU, SMAGDi compresses a 40B multi-agent system into a 6B student while retaining 88% of its accuracy, substantially outperforming prior distillation methods such as MAGDi, standard KD, and fine-tuned baselines.

Instead of handling overidentification by reweighting the data to satisfy the moment conditions (as in Generalized Empirical Likelihood methods), this method proceeds by allowing for errors in the variables of the least mean-square magnitude necessary to simultaneously satisfy all moment conditions. This approach, based on the notions of optimal transport and Wasserstein metric, aims to address the problem of assigning a logical interpretation to GMM results even when overidentification tests reject the null, a situation that cannot always be avoided in applications. We illustrate the method by revisiting Duranton, Morrow and Turner's (2014) study of the relationship between a city's exports and the extent of its transportation infrastructure.

By studying the influence of hyperpriors on the solution of EBF, we establish a theoretical connection between the choice of the hyperprior and the sparsity as well as the local optimality of the resulting solutions. We show that some strictly increasing hyperpriors, such as half-Laplace and half-generalized Gaussian with the power in $(0,1)$, effectively promote sparsity and improve solution stability with respect to measurement noise. Based on this analysis, we adopt a proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm with convergence guaranties for both convex and concave hyperpriors. Extensive numerical tests on two-dimensional image deblurring problems demonstrate that introducing appropriate hyperpriors significantly promotes the sparsity of the solution and enhances restoration accuracy. Furthermore, we illustrate the influence of the noise level and the ill-posedness of inverse problems to EBF solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5148\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684PALM\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u89e3\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5177\u6709\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u90bb\u8fd1\u4ea4\u66ff\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u5316(PALM)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u51f8\u548c\u51f9\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4fc3\u8fdb\u89e3\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u75c5\u6001\u6027\u5bf9EBF\u89e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e25\u683c\u9012\u589e\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u5982\u534a\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u548c\u534a\u5e7f\u4e49\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks.

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u951a\u70b9\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u6574\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u4eff\u8fd8\u662f\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u6982\u7387\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u504f\u89c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5b57\u6bb5\u7684\u7cbe\u786eShapley\u503c\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "Gemma-2B\u3001Phi-2\u548cLlama-2-7B\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u951a\u70b9\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\uff1b\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5982GPT-2\u3001Falcon-RW-1B\u548cGPT-Neo-125M\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u53d8\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u80fd\u8c03\u8282\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5f52\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u56e0\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5c06LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4e2d\u5176\u4ed6\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce a log-linear backstepping control law on SE2(3) that preserves full rotational-translational coupling. Leveraging a class of mixed-invariant system, which is a group-affine dynamic model, we derive exact logarithmic error dynamics that are linear in the Lie algebra. The closed-form expressions for the left- and right-Jacobian inverses of SE2(3) are expressed in the paper, which provides us the exact error dynamics without local approximations. A log-linear backstepping control design ensures exponential stability for our error dynamics; since our error dynamics is a block-triangular structure, this allows us to use Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) formulation or $H_\\infty$ gain performance design.

This study used purposive sampling with a sample size of 200 unmarried women from Tamil Nadu aged 18 to 30. The survey results show that more than 50% had never heard the term \"revenge porn,\" and only about 5% had personally experienced it. About 40% believed the victim was at fault, while 43.5% were unsure whether pornographic websites should be banned. Around 11% admitted that they might upload explicit content as revenge, and 8.5% felt that due to cultural taboos around sex, society tends to blame the victim. Police officers should be trained in techniques for psychologically supporting victims. India, which ranks third globally in cybercrime, must adopt better preventive measures. Public awareness and targeted legal reforms could play a major role in reducing such crimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u6cf0\u7c73\u5c14\u7eb3\u5fb7\u90a6200\u540d\u672a\u5a5a\u5973\u6027\u5bf9\u590d\u4ec7\u8272\u60c5\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc750%\u4ece\u672a\u542c\u8bf4\u8fc7\u8be5\u672f\u8bed\uff0c\u4ec55%\u4eb2\u8eab\u7ecf\u5386\u8fc7\uff0c40%\u8ba4\u4e3a\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u6709\u9519\uff0c11%\u627f\u8ba4\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f20\u8272\u60c5\u5185\u5bb9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62a5\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u4ec7\u8272\u60c5\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u7b49\u4eba\u53e3\u5bc6\u96c6\u56fd\u5bb6\u9891\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c4\u5236\uff0c\u4e142010\u5e74\u8c03\u67e5\u663e\u793a18.3%\u5973\u6027\u4e0d\u77e5\u81ea\u5df1\u662f\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u76ee\u7684\u6027\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9009\u53d6\u6cf0\u7c73\u5c14\u7eb3\u5fb7\u90a6200\u540d18-30\u5c81\u672a\u5a5a\u5973\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u8c03\u67e5\u663e\u793a\uff1a50%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u672a\u542c\u8bf4\u8fc7\"\u590d\u4ec7\u8272\u60c5\"\uff1b\u4ec55%\u4eb2\u8eab\u7ecf\u5386\uff1b40%\u8ba4\u4e3a\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u6709\u8d23\u4efb\uff1b43.5%\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u5e94\u7981\u6b62\u8272\u60c5\u7f51\u7ad9\uff1b11%\u627f\u8ba4\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f20\u8272\u60c5\u5185\u5bb9\u62a5\u590d\uff1b8.5%\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u7981\u5fcc\u5bfc\u81f4\u793e\u4f1a\u6307\u8d23\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5370\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u7f51\u7edc\u72af\u7f6a\u7b2c\u4e09\u5927\u56fd\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u9884\u9632\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5e94\u57f9\u8bad\u8b66\u5bdf\u4e3a\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fc3\u7406\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u516c\u4f17\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6539\u9769\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u6b64\u7c7b\u72af\u7f6a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Deploying these models requires energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, and in some cases has even prompted plans to power data centers with nuclear energy. Despite this growing relevance, systematic analyses of inference energy consumption remain limited. In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand. Building on these insights, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, and implement it as a browser extension to raise awareness of the environmental impact of generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6db5\u76d632,500\u591a\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u901a\u5e38\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6574\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u5206\u6790\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528vLLM\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u572821\u79cdGPU\u914d\u7f6e\u548c155\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c32,500\u591a\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u89c1\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u3002"}}

First, we derive the exact (infeasible) design-based variance of the HT ATE estimator that accounts jointly for cluster- and unit-level sampling as well as random assignment. Second, extending Aronow et al (2014), we provide a sharp, attanable upper bound on that variance and propose a consistent estimator of the bound using only observed outcomes and known sampling/assignment probabilities.

Using NBBO event-time data for about 1,500 regular trading days, we form for every lag L ordered pairs of a backward price increment (\"push\") and a forward price increment (\"response\"), standardize them, and estimate the expected responses on a fine grid of push magnitudes. The resulting lag-by-magnitude maps reveal a persistent structural shift: for short lags (1-5,000 ticks), expected responses cluster near zero across most push magnitudes, suggesting high short-term efficiency; beyond that range, pronounced tails emerge, indicating that larger historical pushes increasingly correlate with nonzero conditional responses. We also find that large negative pushes are followed by stronger positive responses than equally large positive pushes, consistent with asymmetric liquidity replenishment after sell-side shocks.

However, prevailing moderation systems are centralized and task-specific, offering limited transparency and neglecting diverse user preferences--an approach ill-suited for privacy-sensitive or decentralized environments. We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems.

Grounded in socio-technical systems (STS) theory, this mixed-methods study audits workforce preparedness across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman. We combine term frequency--inverse document frequency (TF--IDF) analysis of six national AI strategies (NASs), an inventory of 47 publicly disclosed AI initiatives (January 2017--April 2025), paired case studies, the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and the Saudi Data & Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) Academy, and a scenario matrix linking oil-revenue slack (technical capacity) to regulatory coherence (social alignment). Across the corpus, 34/47 initiatives (0.72; 95% Wilson CI 0.58--0.83) exhibit joint social--technical design; country-level indices span 0.57--0.90 (small n; intervals overlap). Scenario results suggest that, under our modeled conditions, regulatory convergence plausibly binds outcomes more than fiscal capacity: fragmented rules can offset high oil revenues, while harmonized standards help preserve progress under austerity.

However, such IBRs face synchronization instability issues, which might be worsened by inadequate secondary level frequency and voltage regulation.

Additionally, we conduct a series of computational experiments using Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data to evaluate the performance of our proposed model. Our study demonstrates that the proposed adaptive model achieves a higher shelf life, extending it by over 18\\% compared to traditional optimization models, by dynamically mitigating temperature deviations through a temperature feedback mechanism.

This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness. These results demonstrate that reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints.

While each choice of $\u03c9$ may be defensible in empirical contexts that motivate a particular method, it relies on fundamentally untestable and often fragile assumptions. I develop an identification framework that allows for all weights satisfying a Synthetic Parallel Trends assumption: the treated unit's trend is parallel to a weighted combination of control units' trends for a general class of weights. The framework nests these existing methods as special cases and is by construction robust to violations of their respective assumptions. I construct a valid confidence set for the identified set of the treatment effect, which admits a linear programming representation with estimated coefficients and nuisance parameters that are profiled out.

The model couples operator learning with constrained decoders and is trained with extragradient-style updates plus projection. We introduce evaluation metrics for derivatives term structures (NAS, CNAS, NI, Dual-Gap, Stability Rate) and show gains over Fourier Neural Operator, DeepONet, and state-space sequence models on historical SPX and VIX data. Ablation studies indicate that tying the SPX and VIX legs reduces Dual-Gap and improves NI, Lipschitz projection stabilizes calibration, and selective state updates improve long-horizon generalization.

However, effective Monte Carlo algorithms for inference with these models have not yet been established, except for several simple cases. In this study, we show that, compared with the slow inference achieved with existing program libraries, the performance of Riemannian-manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC) can be drastically improved by optimising the computation order according to the model structure and dynamically programming the eigendecomposition. This improvement cannot be achieved when using an existing library based on a naive automatic differentiator.

DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation. To our knowledge, DFM is the first ODE-based approach guaranteeing translation identifiability.

Since sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI) arise from the mis-tuning of control gains under specific grid configurations, effective mitigation strategies require adaptive re-tuning of these gains. Such adaptiveness can be achieved by employing a closed-loop, learning-based framework that considers the grid conditions responsible for such sub-synchronous oscillations. This paper addresses this need by adopting methodologies inspired by Markov decision process (MDP) based reinforcement learning (RL), with a particular emphasis on simpler deep policy gradient methods with additional SSCI-specific signal processing modules such as down-sampling, bandpass filtering, and oscillation energy dependent reward computations.

Despite their empirical success, the mathematical foundations of those models remain only partially understood, particularly regarding the stability and consistency of the underlying stochastic and partial differential equations governing their dynamics.\n  In this work, we develop a rigorous partial differential equation (PDE) framework for score-based diffusion processes. Building on the Li--Yau differential inequality for the heat flow, we prove well-posedness and derive sharp $L^p$-stability estimates for the associated score-based Fokker--Planck dynamics, providing a mathematically consistent description of their temporal evolution. Through entropy stability methods, we further show that the reverse-time dynamics of diffusion models concentrate on the data manifold for compactly supported data distributions and a broad class of initialization schemes, with a concentration rate of order $\\sqrt{t}$ as $t \\to 0$.\n  These results yield a theoretical guarantee that, under exact score guidance, diffusion trajectories return to the data manifold while preserving imitation fidelity. Our findings also provide practical insights for designing diffusion models, including principled criteria for score-function construction, loss formulation, and stopping-time selection. Altogether, this framework provides a quantitative understanding of the trade-off between generative capacity and imitation fidelity, bridging rigorous analysis and model design within a unified mathematical perspective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684PDE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Fokker-Planck\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u548cL^p\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u6570\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f1a\u8fd4\u56de\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u4eff\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u968f\u673a\u548c\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u6d41\u7684Li-Yau\u5fae\u5206\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684PDE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u53cd\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86L^p\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7d27\u652f\u6491\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u221at\u7684\u901f\u7387\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u6570\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fd4\u56de\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6a21\u4eff\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u635f\u5931\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u505c\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

This paper introduces AgriTrust, a federated semantic governance framework designed to resolve this paradox. AgriTrust integrates a multi-stakeholder governance model, built on pillars of Data Sovereignty, Transparent Data Contracts, Equitable Value Sharing, and Regulatory Compliance, with a semantic digital layer. This layer is realized through the AgriTrust Core Ontology, a formal OWL ontology that provides a shared vocabulary for tokenization, traceability, and certification, enabling true semantic interoperability across independent platforms. A key innovation is a blockchain-agnostic, multi-provider architecture that prevents vendor lock-in. The framework's viability is demonstrated through case studies across three critical Brazilian supply chains: coffee (for EUDR compliance), soy (for mass balance), and beef (for animal tracking). The results show that AgriTrust successfully enables verifiable provenance, automates compliance, and creates new revenue streams for data producers, thereby transforming data sharing from a trust-based dilemma into a governed, automated operation.

Avants", "Nicholas J. Tustison", "James R Stone"], "title": "Non-Negative Stiefel Approximating Flow: Orthogonalish Matrix Optimization for Interpretable Embeddings", "comment": null, "summary": "Interpretable representation learning is a central challenge in modern machine learning, particularly in high-dimensional settings such as neuroimaging, genomics, and text analysis. Current methods often struggle to balance the competing demands of interpretability and model flexibility, limiting their effectiveness in extracting meaningful insights from complex data. We introduce Non-negative Stiefel Approximating Flow (NSA-Flow), a general-purpose matrix estimation framework that unifies ideas from sparse matrix factorization, orthogonalization, and constrained manifold learning. NSA-Flow enforces structured sparsity through a continuous balance between reconstruction fidelity and column-wise decorrelation, parameterized by a single tunable weight. The method operates as a smooth flow near the Stiefel manifold with proximal updates for non-negativity and adaptive gradient control, yielding representations that are simultaneously sparse, stable, and interpretable. Unlike classical regularization schemes, NSA-Flow provides an intuitive geometric mechanism for manipulating sparsity at the level of global structure while simplifying latent features.

Recent efforts shift toward KV merging, merging eviction tokens with retention tokens based on similarity. However, in multimodal scenarios, distributional biases across modality tokens and attentional biases in cross-modal interactions limit its effectiveness. This work introduces FlowMM, an adaptive framework for cross-modal information flow-guided multimodal KV cache merging. FlowMM leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply layer-specific merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while preserving contextual integrity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism that jointly evaluates token similarity and task-critical sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while safeguarding high-sensitivity ones.

Advances in technology make them increasingly difficult to detect until they are close to the target and highly resistant to jamming. The evasion maneuver is the last line of defense for an aircraft. However, conventional rule-based evasion strategies are limited by computational demands and aerodynamic constraints, and existing learning-based approaches remain unconvincing for manned aircraft against modern missiles. To enhance aircraft survivability, this study investigates missile evasion inspired by the pursuit-evasion game between a gazelle and a cheetah and proposes a multi-stage reinforcement learning-based evasion strategy. The strategy learns a large azimuth policy to turn to evade, a small azimuth policy to keep moving away, and a short distance policy to perform agile aggressive maneuvers to avoid. One of the three policies is activated at each stage based on distance and azimuth. To evaluate performance, a high-fidelity simulation environment modeling an F-16 aircraft and missile under various conditions is used to compare the proposed approach with baseline strategies. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance, enabling the F-16 aircraft to successfully avoid missiles with a probability of 80.89 percent for velocities ranging from 800 m/s to 1400 m/s, maximum overloads from 40 g to 50 g, detection distances from 5000 m to 15000 m, and random azimuths.

We tackle this problem via semidefinite programming (SDP). We derive deterministic combinatorial conditions on the observation mask $\u03a9$ (the set of observed indices) under which our SDPs solve the exact completion and achieve robust recovery in the noisy regime. These conditions can be met with as few as $\\bigl(\\sum_{i=1}^d n_i\\bigr) - d + 1$ observations for special $\u03a9$. When $\u03a9$ is uniformly random, our conditions hold with $O\\!\\bigl((\\prod_{i=1}^d n_i)^{1/2}\\,\\mathrm{polylog}(\\prod_{i=1}^d n_i)\\bigr)$ observations. Prior works mostly focus on the uniformly random case, ignoring the practical relevance of structured masks. For $d=2$ (matrix completion), our propagation condition holds if and only if the completion problem admits a unique solution. Our results apply to tensors of arbitrary order and cover both exact and noisy settings. In contrast to much of the literature, our guarantees rely solely on the combinatorial structure of the observation mask, without incoherence assumptions on the ground-truth tensor or uniform randomness of the samples.

Mapping Coverage and Gaps in First and Third Party Evaluations", "comment": null, "summary": "Foundation models are increasingly central to high-stakes AI systems, and governance frameworks now depend on evaluations to assess their risks and capabilities. Although general capability evaluations are widespread, social impact assessments covering bias, fairness, privacy, environmental costs, and labor practices remain uneven across the AI ecosystem. To characterize this landscape, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of both first-party and third-party social impact evaluation reporting across a wide range of model developers. Our study examines 186 first-party release reports and 183 post-release evaluation sources, and complements this quantitative analysis with interviews of model developers. We find a clear division of evaluation labor: first-party reporting is sparse, often superficial, and has declined over time in key areas such as environmental impact and bias, while third-party evaluators including academic researchers, nonprofits, and independent organizations provide broader and more rigorous coverage of bias, harmful content, and performance disparities. However, this complementarity has limits. Only model developers can authoritatively report on data provenance, content moderation labor, financial costs, and training infrastructure, yet interviews reveal that these disclosures are often deprioritized unless tied to product adoption or regulatory compliance. Our findings indicate that current evaluation practices leave major gaps in assessing AI's societal impacts, highlighting the urgent need for policies that promote developer transparency, strengthen independent evaluation ecosystems, and create shared infrastructure to aggregate and compare third-party evaluations in a consistent and accessible way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9AI\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u72b6\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b2c\u4e00\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u52a0\u5f3a\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5730\u4f4d\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u73af\u5883\u6210\u672c\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u5b9e\u8df5\uff09\u5728\u6574\u4e2aAI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86186\u4efd\u7b2c\u4e00\u65b9\u53d1\u5e03\u62a5\u544a\u548c183\u4efd\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u786e\u5206\u5de5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u65b9\u62a5\u544a\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u80a4\u6d45\uff0c\u5728\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u80fd\u6743\u5a01\u62a5\u544a\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u52b3\u52a8\u3001\u8d22\u52a1\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u52a0\u5f3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u521b\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4ee5\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

It demonstrates that regression models with fixed or time-varying parameters can be estimated using the OLS and time-varying OLS methods, respectively, across a broad class of regressors and noise processes not covered by existing theory. The proposed setting facilitates the development of asymptotic theory and the estimation of robust standard errors. The robust confidence interval estimators accommodate substantial heterogeneity in both regressors and noise. The resulting robust standard error estimates coincide with White's (1980) heteroskedasticity-consistent estimator but are applicable to a broader range of conditions, including models with missing data. They are computationally simple and perform well in Monte Carlo simulations. Their robustness, generality, and ease of implementation make them highly suitable for empirical applications.

While qualitative studies highlight the potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with traditional optimization, a formal, quantitative demonstration of this synergy is lacking. This paper introduces a novel stochastic learning-optimization framework that integrates Bayesian inference with inventory optimization for supply chain management (SCM). We model a two-echelon inventory system subject to stochastic demand and supply disruptions, comparing a traditional static optimization policy against an adaptive policy where Bayesian learning continuously updates parameter estimates to inform stochastic optimization. Our simulations over 365 periods across three operational scenarios demonstrate that the integrated approach achieves 7.4\\% cost reduction in stable environments and 5.7\\% improvement during supply disruptions, while revealing important limitations during sudden demand shocks due to the inherent conservatism of Bayesian updating.

Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67902013-2025\u5e74\u82f1\u8bed\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u4fb5\u8680\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u516c\u5f00\u91c7\u7528\u540e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5448\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5360\u6bd4\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u52a0\uff08\u5df2\u8fbe30-40%\uff09\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u67902013-2025\u5e74\u82f1\u8bed\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\uff08\u6765\u81eaCommon Crawl\uff09\u7684\u5e74\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "LLM\u516c\u5f00\u91c7\u7528\u524d\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7a33\u6b65\u4e0a\u5347\uff08\u53d7\u65e9\u671fRNN/LSTM\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\uff0cLLM\u91c7\u7528\u540e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5448\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9012\u5f52AI\u6c61\u67d3\u4f55\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5a01\u80c1\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework.

This study presents a simulation framework integrating a graph theory-based trip-vehicle matching mechanism with real cruising taxi operations data to simulate ride-hailing services in Chengdu, China. The performances of the two on-demand mobility service modes (i.e., ride-hailing and street-hailing) are evaluated in terms of three key performance indicators: average passenger waiting time (APWT), average deadheading miles (ADM), and average deadheading energy consumption (ADEC). We further examine the impacts of spatiotemporal characteristics and three types of policies: fleet size management, geofencing, and demand management, on the performance of ride-hailing services. Results show that under the same fleet size and trip demand as street-hailing taxis, ride-hailing services without cruising achieve substantial improvements, reducing APWT, ADM, and ADEC by 81\\%, 75\\%, and 72.1\\%, respectively. These improvements are most pronounced during midnight low-demand hours and in remote areas such as airports. Our analysis also reveals that for ride-hailing service, (1) expanding fleet size yields diminishing marginal benefits; (2) geofencing worsens overall performance while it improves the performance of serving all trips within the city center; and (3) demand-side management targeting trips to high-attraction and low-demand areas can effectively reduce passenger waiting time without increasing deadheading costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7f51\u7ea6\u8f66\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u5de1\u6e38\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7f51\u7ea6\u8f66\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8f66\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u51fa\u884c\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e58\u5ba2\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7a7a\u9a76\u91cc\u7a0b\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8f66\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u5730\u7406\u56f4\u680f\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7f51\u7ea6\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5de1\u6e38\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u884c\u7a0b-\u8f66\u8f86\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5de1\u6e38\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u8fd0\u8425\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u56fd\u6210\u90fd\u7684\u7f51\u7ea6\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8f66\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u51fa\u884c\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f51\u7ea6\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u76f8\u6bd4\u5de1\u6e38\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u4e58\u5ba2\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u7a7a\u9a76\u91cc\u7a0b\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u7a7a\u9a76\u80fd\u8017\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8681%\u300175%\u548c72.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f51\u7ea6\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5de1\u6e38\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\uff1b\u8f66\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5f20\u5b58\u5728\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff1b\u5730\u7406\u56f4\u680f\u4f1a\u6076\u5316\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u6539\u5584\u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3\u670d\u52a1\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u4f4e\u9700\u6c42\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u7a7a\u9a76\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a powerful force in education, with the potential to address major challenges, personalize learning, and innovate teaching practices. However, these advances come with significant risks: rapid AI development can undermine human agency, exacerbate inequities, and outpace our capacity to guide its use with sound policy. Human learning presupposes cognitive efforts and social interaction (dialogues). In response to this evolving landscape, an international workshop titled \"Educational Dialogue: Moving Thinking Forward\" convened 19 leading researchers from 11 countries in Cambridge (September 1-3, 2025) to examine the intersection of AI and educational dialogue. This AI-focused strand of the workshop centered on three critical questions: (1) When is AI truly useful in education, and when might it merely replace human effort at the expense of learning?

Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution. We demonstrate through experiments on three challenging benchmarks that our LEAP-tuned model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LEAP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u6267\u884c\u5931\u8d25\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8c03\u4f18\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLEAP\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LEAP\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we first generalize the likelihood-based LLM detection method of a previous study by introducing a flexible weighted formulation, and further adapt this approach to the inverse transform sampling method. Moving beyond watermark detection, we extend this adaptive detection strategy to tackle the more challenging problem of segmenting a given text into watermarked and non-watermarked substrings. In contrast to the approach in a previous study, which relies on accurate estimation of next-token probabilities that are highly sensitive to prompt estimation, our proposed framework removes the need for precise prompt estimation.

While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTemporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u6765\u9f13\u52b1\u76f8\u90bbtoken\u95f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u6d45\u5c42\u3001token\u7279\u5b9a\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9a71\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u6982\u5ff5\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u672c\u8eab\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u5177\u6709\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u53e5\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faT-SAEs\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u6765\u9f13\u52b1\u76f8\u90bbtoken\u95f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cT-SAEs\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "T-SAEs\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance while matching or surpassing KL-DRO. On the original CIFAR-10 dataset, Var-DRO remains competitive, exhibiting the modest trade-off anticipated when prioritizing robustness. The proposed framework is unsupervised (requiring no group labels), straightforward to implement, theoretically sound, and computationally efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Var-DRO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u635f\u5931\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfDRO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u5f53\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u5c11\u6570\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u6216\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u5f53\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6837\u672c\u7ea7DRO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5f0f\u53cc\u8fb9\u7ea6\u675f\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u6297\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u51f8\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5185\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6ce8\u6c34\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u659c\u5761\u8c03\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10-C\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728Waterbirds\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u539f\u59cbCIFAR-10\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u65f6\u7684\u9002\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "Var-DRO\u662f\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In this study, we collected 250 authentic legal questions from the Facebook group \"Know Your Rights,\" where verified legal experts regularly provide authoritative answers. These questions were subsequently submitted to four four advanced AI models and responses were generated using a consistent, standardized prompt. A comprehensive dual evaluation framework was employed, in which a state-of-the-art LLM model served as a judge, assessing each AI-generated response across four critical dimensions: factual accuracy, legal appropriateness, completeness, and clarity. Following this, the same set of questions was evaluated by three licensed Bangladeshi legal professionals according to the same criteria. In addition, automated evaluation metrics, including BLEU scores, were applied to assess response similarity. Our findings reveal a complex landscape where AI models frequently generate high-quality, well-structured legal responses but also produce dangerous misinformation, including fabricated case citations, incorrect legal procedures, and potentially harmful advice.

We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors. This study provides new insights into the strengths and limitations of current thinking LLMs in software engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf96\u4e2a\u601d\u8003\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u601d\u8003\u578bLLMs\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u663e\u5f0f\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f306\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406LLMs\u5728100\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b65\u9aa4\u8ba1\u6570\u3001\u5197\u957f\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u6b65\u9aa4\u9884\u7b97\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c5521\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u6b65\u9aa4\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b/\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u6b65\u9aa4\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6210\u529f\u4f46\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5f88\u5c11\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u3002\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u601d\u8003\u578bLLMs\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u53d7\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Improvements to random forests, such as applying Lasso regression to the tree predictions, have been proposed in order to reduce model bias. However, these changes can sometimes degrade performance (e.g., an increase in mean squared error). In this paper, we show in theory that the relative performance of these two methods, standard and Lasso-weighted random forests, depends on the signal-to-noise ratio. We further propose a unified framework to combine random forests and Lasso selection by applying adaptive weighting and show mathematically that it can strictly outperform the other two methods. We compare the three methods through simulation, including bias-variance decomposition, error estimates evaluation, and variable importance analysis. We also show the versatility of our method by applications to a variety of real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548cLasso\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e25\u683c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548cLasso\u52a0\u6743\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u6811\u9884\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528Lasso\u56de\u5f52\uff09\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u589e\u52a0\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548cLasso\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e25\u683c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5305\u62ec\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548cLasso\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Fuel distributors specifically require precise estimates to avoid inventory shortages or excesses.

In this research, we evaluate the performance of data-driven approaches using a substantial amount of data obtained from a major aviation fuel distributor in the Danish market. Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies. To ensure the reliability of the data-driven approaches and provide valuable insights to practitioners, we analyze three different datasets.

Platoon coordination is essential to smoothen the interaction between CAV platoons and non-CAV traffic. Based on a fluid queuing model, we develop a \"probe-and-release\" algorithm that simultaneously estimates environmental parameters and coordinates CAV platoons for traffic stabilization. We show that this algorithm ensures bounded estimation errors and bounded traffic queues. The proof builds on a Lyapunov function that jointly penalizes estimation errors and traffic queues and a drift argument for an embedded Markov process. We validate the proposed algorithm in a standard micro-simulation environment and compare against a representative deep reinforcement learning method in terms of control performance and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\"\u63a2\u6d4b-\u91ca\u653e\"\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u534f\u8c03\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u74f6\u9888\u5904\u7684CAV\u8f66\u961f\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u53d8\u4ea4\u901a\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u968f\u673a\u8f66\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u754c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u961f\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3CAV\u8f66\u961f\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u74f6\u9888\u5904\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u65f6\u53d8\u4ea4\u901a\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u968f\u673aCAV\u8f66\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u6ed1CAV\u8f66\u961f\u4e0e\u975eCAV\u4ea4\u901a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u4f53\u6392\u961f\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\"\u63a2\u6d4b-\u91ca\u653e\"\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u73af\u5883\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u534f\u8c03CAV\u8f66\u961f\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u4ea4\u901a\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u8bba\u8bc1\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u754c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6709\u754c\u4ea4\u901a\u961f\u5217\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u89c2\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\"\u63a2\u6d4b-\u91ca\u653e\"\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u74f6\u9888\u5904\u7684CAV\u8f66\u961f\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u4ea4\u901a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This article provides an extensive review of the literature on digital twins (DTs) and their utilization at the levels of product/production line, production system, and enterprise, and considers how they have been applied under real industrial conditions. This article classifies the types of DTs as well as modeling technologies of DT and applications in different fields, with particular focus on the research of strengths and limitations of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) for systems modelling. A generic structure for DT is proposed, outlining the essential components and flow of data. Case studies demonstrate the benefits of DTs for increased efficiency, reduced downtime, and improved lifecycle management, as well as challenges caused by the complexity of data integration and cybersecurity risk, and high implementation costs. This paper contributes to the growing body of knowledge by identifying both the opportunities and barriers to widespread DT adoption. This study concludes that while DTs offer transformative capabilities for enhancing efficiency and decision-making, overcoming these challenges is crucial for realizing their widespread adoption and impact across service and manufacturing sectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f(DT)\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a4.0\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5305\u62ecDT\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4eff\u771f(DES)\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DT\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86DT\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6539\u5584\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u9ad8\u5b9e\u65bd\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a4.0\u4e2d\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u68b3\u7406\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u6280\u672f\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u79bb\u6563\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4eff\u771f\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u9ad8\u5b9e\u65bd\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5177\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u514b\u670d\u5b9e\u65bd\u6311\u6218\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u5236\u9020\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Uncovering the main topics of interest in the W3C", "comment": "9 pages, 11 figures, 1 table", "summary": "This paper identifies the primary topics of interest of organizations participating in the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the leading standards body for the Web. Using publicly available data from the W3C website, we analyze the participation of member organizations in W3C groups, treating the number of representatives allocated to each group as a proxy for their interests. By applying topic modeling and similarity analysis to these participation patterns, we uncover clusters of related groups and shared priorities among organizations. The results reveal five prominent areas of focus -- Web, Ads & Privacy; High Performance; Credentials & Web of Things; Accessibility; and Payments -- and show that large enterprises, particularly those based in the United States, dominate participation in core Web development and advertising-related topics, while Japanese organizations are more active in the Web of Things.

While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u6001\u6536\u76ca\u3001\u4e2d\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u6d1e\u5bdf\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6d77\u91cf\u5728\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6a21\u6001\u6536\u76ca\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b2) \u4e2d\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u91cf\u5316\uff1b3) \u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u96c6\u6210\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b2) \u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u6613\u53d7\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6ce2\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3) \u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u56fe\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5206\u6b67\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u96c6\u6210\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

These systems can be characterized by estimating their parameters from sampled data. The key problem is how to optimally select sampling points to achieve accurate parameter estimation. Classical approaches often rely on Fisher information matrix-based criteria such as A-, D-, and E-optimality, which require an initial parameter estimate and may yield suboptimal results when the estimate is inaccurate. This study proposes two simulation-based methods for optimal sampling design that do not depend on initial parameter estimates. The first method, E-optimal-ranking (EOR), employs the E-optimal criterion, while the second utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.

The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once.

In this work, we present a multimodal polymer dataset to fine-tune VLMs through instruction-tuning pairs and assess the impact of multimodality on prediction performance. Our fine-tuned models, using LoRA, outperform unimodal and baseline approaches, demonstrating the benefits of multimodal learning. Additionally, this approach reduces the need to train separate models for different properties, lowering deployment and maintenance costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u8d28\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u72ec\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u8d28\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u72ec\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

For stability analysis and control-related problems, it is desired that the defining RKHS of the Koopman operator should account for both the stability of an equilibrium point (as a local property) and the regularity of the dynamics on the state space (as a global property). To this end, we show that by using the product kernel formed by the linear kernel and a Wendland radial kernel, the resulting RKHS is invariant under the action of Koopman operator (under certain smoothness conditions). Furthermore, when the equilibrium is asymptotically stable, the spectrum of Koopman operator is provably confined inside the unit circle, and escapes therefrom upon bifurcation. Thus, the learned Koopman operator with provable probabilistic error bound provides a stability certificate. In addition to numerical verification, we further discuss how such a fundamental spectrum--stability relation would be useful for Koopman-based control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e58\u79ef\u6838\u7684Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u6838\u548cWendland\u5f84\u5411\u6838\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6784\u5efaRKHS\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8c31\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u8d28\uff09\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u8d28\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u9002\u7684RKHS\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6838\u548cWendland\u5f84\u5411\u6838\u7684\u4e58\u79ef\u6838\u6784\u5efaRKHS\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u6e10\u8fd1\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6\uff0cKoopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u8c31\u88ab\u4e25\u683c\u9650\u5236\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u5706\u5185\uff0c\u5206\u5c94\u65f6\u5219\u9003\u79bb\u5355\u4f4d\u5706\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc1\u4e66\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8c31-\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions.

Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] proved that generation is achievable in surprisingly general settings. But their generator suffers from ``mode collapse,'' producing from an ever-smaller subset of the target. To address this, Kleinberg and Wei [KW25] require the generator's output to be ``dense'' in the target language. They showed that generation with density, surprisingly, remains achievable at the same generality.\n  Both results assume perfect data: no noisy insertions and no omissions. This raises a central question: how much contamination can generation tolerate? Recent works made partial progress on this question by studying (non-dense) generation with either finite amounts of noise (but no omissions) or omissions (but no noise).\n  We characterize robustness under contaminated enumerations: 1. Generation under Contamination: Language generation in the limit is achievable for all countable collections iff the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. When this fails, we characterize which collections are generable. 2. Dense Generation under Contamination: Dense generation is strictly less robust to contamination than generation. As a byproduct, we resolve an open question of Raman and Raman [ICML25] by showing that generation is possible with only membership oracle access under finitely many contaminated examples.\n  Finally, we introduce a beyond-worst-case model inspired by curriculum learning and prove that dense generation is achievable even with infinite contamination provided the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero.

We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines.

With the rise of generative AI (GenAI), students even at the introductory level are able to generate large quantities of code, and it is becoming increasingly important to equip them with the ability to decompose problems. There is not yet a consensus among educators on how to best teach and assess the skill of decomposition, particularly in introductory computing. This practitioner paper details the development of questions to assess the skill of problem decomposition, and impressions about how these questions were received by students. A challenge unique to problem decomposition questions is their necessarily lengthy context, and we detail our approach to addressing this problem using Question Suites: scaffolded sequences of questions that help students understand a question's context before attempting to decompose it. We then describe the use of open-ended drawing of decomposition diagrams as another form of assessment. We outline the learning objectives used to design our questions and describe how we addressed challenges encountered in early iterations.

While the minimax theory for stationary bandits is well established, understanding analogous limits in time-varying settings is challenging. Existing lower bounds rely on what we refer to as infrequent sampling arguments, where long intervals without exploration allow adversarial reward changes that induce large regret.\n  In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different approach based on a belief inertia argument. Our analysis captures how an algorithm's empirical beliefs, encoded through historical reward averages, create momentum that resists new evidence after a change. We show how this inertia can be exploited to construct adversarial instances that mislead classical algorithms such as Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, and UCB, causing them to suffer regret that grows linearly with T and with a substantial constant factor, regardless of how their parameters are tuned, even with a single change point.\n  We extend the analysis to algorithms that periodically restart to handle non stationarity and prove that, even then, the worst case regret remains linear in T. Our results indicate that utilizing belief inertia can be a powerful method for deriving sharp lower bounds in non stationary bandits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u5ff5\u60ef\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6bb5\u5e73\u7a33\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u9057\u61be\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u5373\u4f7f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u6216\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u542f\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4f1a\u906d\u53d7\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6bb5\u5e73\u7a33\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u5206\u6790\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u8bba\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u60ef\u6027\u7684\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u5ff5\u60ef\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u5956\u52b1\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\u51fa\u73b0\u540e\u4ea7\u751f\u62b5\u6297\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u60ef\u6027\u6784\u9020\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6765\u8bef\u5bfc\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u5982Explore Then Commit\u3001epsilon greedy\u548cUCB\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u4f1a\u906d\u53d7\u4e0eT\u6210\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u5f53\u5927\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u53ea\u6709\u5355\u4e2a\u53d8\u5316\u70b9\u3002\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u542f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u9057\u61be\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u5ff5\u60ef\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u4e3a\u63a8\u5bfc\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u8001\u864e\u673a\u4e2d\u5c16\u9510\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on accuracy and output quality, and they ignore an important factor: decoding token efficiency. In real systems, generating 10,000 tokens versus 100,000 tokens leads to large differences in latency, cost, and energy. In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as \"free\" to multiply. OckBench provides a unified platform for measuring, comparing, and guiding research in token-efficient reasoning.

Deep neural kernels provide a principled framework to interpret over-parameterized neural networks by mapping hierarchical feature transformations into kernel spaces, thereby combining the expressive power of deep architectures with the analytical tractability of kernel methods. Recent advances, particularly neural tangent kernels (NTKs) derived by gradient inner products, have established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and nonparametric Bayesian inference. However, the existing NTK paradigm has been predominantly confined to the infinite-width regime, while overlooking the representational role of network depth. To address this gap, we propose a depth-induced NTK kernel based on a shortcut-related architecture, which converges to a Gaussian process as the network depth approaches infinity. We theoretically analyze the training invariance and spectrum properties of the proposed kernel, which stabilizes the kernel dynamics and mitigates degeneration. Experimental results further underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings significantly extend the existing landscape of the neural kernel theory and provide an in-depth understanding of deep learning and the scaling law.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6377\u5f84\u8fde\u63a5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfcNTK\u6838\uff0c\u8be5\u6838\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709NTK\u7406\u8bba\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838(NTK)\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u4ee5\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6377\u5f84\u8fde\u63a5\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfcNTK\u6838\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8be5\u6838\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfcNTK\u6838\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6838\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Drawing inspiration from the classical Unit Commitment Problem (UCP), we first design a linear model to determine the optimal power generation mix over a 24-hour horizon, using real-world data from Vietnam, a country with a highly carbon intensive energy system. This allows us to estimate time-varying CO2 emissions and translate them into an emission cost signal. We then incorporate this environmental cost into a smart charging optimization model, formulated as a linear program (LP). Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms a baseline First-In-First-Served (FIFS) approach, achieving notable reductions in both CO2 emissions and charging costs also compared to another optimization approach. The results demonstrate the potential of this multiobjective optimization framework to support more sustainable and cost-efficient EV charging strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5145\u7535\u6210\u672c\u548cCO2\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u5728\u8d8a\u5357\u9ad8\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5145\u7535\u6210\u672c\u548cCO2\u6392\u653e\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u56fd\u5bb6", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4f4d\u627f\u8bfa\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9a24\u5c0f\u65f6\u6700\u4f18\u53d1\u7535\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b2\uff09\u4f30\u7b97\u65f6\u53d8CO2\u6392\u653e\u5e76\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6392\u653e\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06\u73af\u5883\u6210\u672c\u7eb3\u5165\u667a\u80fd\u5145\u7535\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u5230\u5148\u670d\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728CO2\u6392\u653e\u548c\u5145\u7535\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u7b56\u7565"}}

To bridge this divide in an empirically rigorous way, we conducted an interview study with 48 religious people and/or experts from 11 faiths, and we document how religious people experience, understand, and imagine technologies. We show that religious stakeholders find non-neutral secular embeddings in technologies and the firms and people that design them, and how these manifest in unintended harms for religious and nonreligious users. Our findings reveal how users navigate technoreligious practices with religiously informed mental models and what they desire from technologies. Informed by this, we distill six design values -- wonder, humility, space, embodiedness, community, and eternity -- to guide technologists in considering and leveraging religion as an additional, valid sociocultural resource when designing for a holistic user.

When $\u03c4$ is unknown, a fundamental scale ambiguity emerges that couples $\u03c4$ with the reward parameters ($\u03b8$), making them statistically unidentifiable. We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $\u03b8$ and $\u03c4$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity. We propose an efficient Normalized Least Squares (NLS) estimator and prove it achieves the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ convergence rate for joint parameter recovery.

As models develop induction heads, they often experience a sharp drop in training loss, a phenomenon cited as evidence that induction heads may serve as a prerequisite for more complex in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities. Taken together, our findings indicate that inductive copying is not essential for learning abstractive ICL mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHapax\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u6765\u7814\u7a76transformer\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u9700\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f53\u6291\u5236\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u65f6\uff0ctransformer\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u662f\u5426\u662f\u590d\u6742\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5148\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHapax\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7701\u7565\u53ef\u7531\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684token\u7684\u635f\u5931\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u572821\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u768413\u4e2a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684token\u4f4d\u7f6e\u635f\u5931\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u9700\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4ed6\u673a\u5236\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, if the equation does not meet the user's expectations, there are few options for getting other equation suggestions without intensive work with the system. To fill this gap, we propose Residuals for Equation Discovery (RED), a post-processing method that improves a given equation in a targeted manner, based on its residuals. By parsing the initial equation to a syntax tree, we can use node-based calculation rules to compute the residual for each subequation of the initial equation. It is then possible to use this residual as new target variable in the original data set and generate a new prompt. If, with the new prompt, the equation discovery system suggests a subequation better than the old subequation on a validation set, we replace the latter by the former. RED is usable with any equation discovery system, is fast to calculate, and is easy to extend for new mathematical operations.

Recently, the performances of ISAC were experimentally evaluated and demonstrated in various scenarios by developing ISAC systems. These systems generally consist of coherent transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) modules. However, actively transmitting radio waves for experiments is not easy due to regulatory restrictions of radio. Meanwhile, the Tx/Rx should be synchronized and Rx need the information of Tx. In this paper, a fully passive mmWave sensing system is developed with software-defined radio for blind ISAC. It only consists of a passive Rx module which does not depend on the Tx. Since the proposed system is not synchronized with Tx and has no knowledge of the transmitted signals, a differential structure with two oppositely-oriented receivers is introduced to realize the sensing function. This structure can mitigate the influences of unknown source signals and other distortions. With the proposed sensing system, the ambient mmWave communication signals are leveraged for sensing without interrupting the existing systems. It can be deployed for field applications such as signal detection and dynamic human activity recognition since it does not emit signals. The efficacy of the developed system is first verified with a metallic plate with known motion pattern. The measured Doppler spectrogram shows good agreement with the simulation results, demonstrating the correctness of the sensing results. Further, the system is evaluated in complex scenarios, including handwaving, single- and multi-person motion detection. The sensing results successfully reflect the corresponding motions, demonstrating that the proposed sensing system can be utilized for blind ISAC in various applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u88ab\u52a8\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f2ISAC\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u88ab\u52a8\u63a5\u6536\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u611f\u77e5", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u4e3b\u52a8\u53d1\u5c04\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6ce2\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u5230\u6cd5\u89c4\u9650\u5236\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u53d1\u5c04\u63a5\u6536\u540c\u6b65\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u53cd\u5411\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u672a\u77e5\u6e90\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5931\u771f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u76f2\u611f\u77e5", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u91d1\u5c5e\u677f\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u8c31\u56fe\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6325\u624b\u3001\u5355\u4eba\u548c\u591a\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f2ISAC\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53d1\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e0d\u5e72\u6270\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf"}}

We describe our Krylov subspace acceleration scheme, contrasting it with existing Anderson acceleration schemes and showing that it largely avoids the latter's well-known ill-conditioning issues in regions of slow convergence. We demonstrate the performance of our scheme relative to Anderson acceleration using standard collections of problems from model predictive control and statistical learning applications. We show that our method is faster than Anderson acceleration across the board in terms of iteration count, and in many cases in computation time, particularly for optimal control and for problems solved to high accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684Anderson\u52a0\u901f\u548cGMRES\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfAnderson\u52a0\u901f\u5728\u6162\u6536\u655b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u75c5\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u5206\u6bb5\u4eff\u5c04\u7b97\u5b50\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684Krylov\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eKrylov\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709Anderson\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u4e0a\u5168\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eAnderson\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6c42\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Krylov\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u6bd4Anderson\u52a0\u901f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6162\u6536\u655b\u533a\u57df\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u75c5\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards.

We introduce a diagnostic that requires no additional training and uses only the forward pass to emit a binary accept or reject signal during agent execution. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention and computes two spectral statistics in early layers, namely the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. We formalize these signals, establish invariances, and provide finite sample estimators with uncertainty quantification. Under a two regime mixture assumption with a monotone likelihood ratio property, we show that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal in the Bayes sense for detecting context inconsistency. Empirically, the high frequency energy ratio exhibits robust bimodality during context verification across multiple model families, which enables gating decisions with overhead below one millisecond on our hardware and configurations.

Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework. This study not only constructs an integrated framework that balances global and local information as well as semantics and structure, but also provides a new perspective for multi-scale feature fusion and structured semantic modeling in text classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3) \u5c06\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b4) \u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfb\u53d6\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728ACC\u3001F1-Score\u3001AUC\u548cPrecision\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems.

Riley", "Prodromos Daoutidis", "Qi Zhang"], "title": "Integer L-Shaped Method with Non-Supporting No-Good Optimality Cuts", "comment": null, "summary": "Two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programs with mixed-integer recourse arise in many practical applications but are computationally challenging due to their large size and the presence of integer decisions in both stages. The integer L-shaped method with alternating cuts is a widely used decomposition algorithm for these problems, relying on optimality cuts generated using subproblems to iteratively refine the master problem. A key computational bottleneck in this approach is solving the mixed-integer subproblems to optimality in order to generate separating cuts. This work proposes a modification to the integer L-shaped method with alternating cuts to allow for efficient generation of no-good optimality cuts that are separating for the current master problem solutions without being supporting hyperplanes of the feasible region. These separating cuts are derived from subproblems that are terminated before the optimal solution is found or proven to be optimal, reducing the computational effort required for cut generation. Additionally, an updated optimality cut generation function is proposed to account for the various complexities introduced by this early termination strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through two case studies on industrially relevant problems from the literature, which illustrate its advantages in handling large-scale instances with complex mixed-integer subproblems. In these cases, the method achieves substantial reductions in solution time or optimality gap compared to the standard integer L-shaped method with alternating cuts, with performance improvements that increase with mixed-integer subproblem size and complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6574\u6570L\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5206\u79bb\u5207\u5272\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u6216\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u968f\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f88\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u4e14\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u90fd\u5305\u542b\u6574\u6570\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6574\u6570L\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6c42\u89e3\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5207\u5272\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u4fee\u6539\u6574\u6570L\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u672a\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5206\u79bb\u5207\u5272\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5207\u5272\u751f\u6210\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5904\u7406\u65e9\u671f\u7ec8\u6b62\u7b56\u7565\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6574\u6570L\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u6216\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u968f\u7740\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u65e9\u671f\u7ec8\u6b62\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5206\u79bb\u5207\u5272\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

As general-purpose AI systems are increasingly adopted, they are causing more real-world harms and displaying the potential to cause significantly more dangerous incidents - events that did or could have caused harm to individuals, property, or the environment. Through a literature review, we develop a framework for understanding the institutional design of AI incident reporting systems, which includes seven dimensions: policy goal, actors submitting and receiving reports, type of incidents reported, level of risk materialization, enforcement of reporting, anonymity of reporters, and post-reporting actions. We then examine nine case studies of incident reporting in safety-critical industries to extract design considerations for AI incident reporting in the United States. We discuss, among other factors, differences in systems operated by regulatory vs. non-regulatory government agencies, near miss reporting, the roles of mandatory reporting thresholds and voluntary reporting channels, how to enable safety learning after reporting, sharing incident information, and clarifying legal frameworks for reporting.

However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMaestro\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u7f16\u6392\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22-\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CLPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u65e9\u5171\u8bc6\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Maestro\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6267\u884c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u8d1f\u8d23\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\u4e0e\u4e2d\u592e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u8d1f\u8d23\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5408\u6210\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165CLPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6218\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMaestro+CLPO\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53476%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534710%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528CLPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0cMaestro\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present FedSparQ, a lightweight compression framework that dynamically sparsifies the gradient of each client through an adaptive threshold, applies half-precision quantization to retained entries and integrates residuals from error feedback to prevent loss of information. FedSparQ requires no manual tuning of sparsity rates or quantization schedules, adapts seamlessly to both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions, and is agnostic to model architecture. Through extensive empirical evaluation on vision benchmarks under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, we show that FedSparQ substantially reduces communication overhead (reducing by 90% of bytes sent compared to FedAvg) while preserving or improving model accuracy (improving by 6% compared to FedAvg non-compressed solution or to state-of-the-art compression models) and enhancing convergence robustness (by 50%, compared to the other baselines).

Despite abundant empirical observations, the understanding of coherence in complex power networks remains incomplete where the dynamics could be highly heterogeneous, nonlinear, and increasingly affected by persistent disturbances such as renewable energy fluctuations. To bridge this gap, this paper extends the blended dynamics approach, originally rooted in consensus analysis of multi-agent systems, to develop a novel coherency analysis in power networks. We show that the frequency responses of coherent machines coupled by nonlinear power flow can be approximately represented by the blended dynamics, which is a weighted average of nonlinear heterogeneous nodal dynamics, even under time-varying disturbances. Specifically, by developing novel bounds on the difference between the trajectories of nodal dynamics and the blended dynamics, we identify two key factors -- either high network connectivity or small time-variation rate of disturbances -- that contribute to coherence. They enable the nodal frequencies to rapidly approach the blended-dynamics trajectory from arbitrary initial state. Furthermore, they ensure the frequencies closely follow this trajectory in the long term, even when the system does not settle to an equilibrium. These insights contribute to the understanding of power system coherency and are further supported by simulation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u7535\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u6216\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\u7387\u662f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u9636\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6ce2\u52a8\u7b49\u6301\u7eed\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5bf9\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5171\u8bc6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7535\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u8282\u70b9\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8f68\u8ff9\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u65b0\u8fb9\u754c\u6765\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u6216\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\u7387\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u8282\u70b9\u9891\u7387\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u5feb\u901f\u63a5\u8fd1\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u957f\u671f\u5185\u7d27\u5bc6\u8ddf\u968f\u8be5\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4fc3\u8fdb\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations.

Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting.

These sources and loads typically rectify the grid AC to DC, e.g., for a DC link, so that a DC grid could eliminate hardware and losses of these conversion stages. However, extended DC grids lack the stabilizing nature of AC impedances so that the voltage is more fragile and power flows may need active control, particularly if redundancy as known from AC, such as rings and meshing, is desired. Furthermore, a DC infrastructure will not replace but will need to interface with the existing AC grid. This paper presents a partial-power energy router architecture that can interface multiple AC and DC lines to enable precise control of voltages and both active as well as reactive power flows. The proposed system uses modular low-voltage high-current series modules supplied through dual active bridges. These modules only need to process a small share of the voltage to control large power flows. The topology reduces component size, cost, energy losses, and reliability more than three times compared to conventional technology. The optional integration of battery energy storage can furthermore eliminate the need for the sum of the power flows of all inputs to be zero at all times. Through dynamic voltage injection relative to the line voltage, the modules effectively balance feeder currents, regulate reactive power, and improve the power factor in AC grids. Real-time hardware-in-the-loop and prototype measurements validate the proposed energy router's performance under diverse operating conditions. Experimental results confirm the series module's functionality in both AC and DC grids as an effective solution for controlling extended grids, including power sharing, voltage, and power quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u90e8\u5206\u529f\u7387\u80fd\u91cf\u8def\u7531\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4f4e\u538b\u5927\u7535\u6d41\u4e32\u8054\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u6709\u6e90\u6865\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591aAC/DC\u7ebf\u8def\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7535\u538b\u3001\u6709\u529f/\u65e0\u529f\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u635f\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u50a8\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u538b\u548c\u4e2d\u538b\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u5360\u6bd4\u589e\u52a0\uff0cDC\u7535\u7f51\u53ef\u6d88\u9664AC-DC\u8f6c\u6362\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u635f\u8017\uff0c\u4f46DC\u7535\u7f51\u7f3a\u4e4fAC\u963b\u6297\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u529f\u7387\u6d41\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709AC\u7535\u7f51\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4f4e\u538b\u5927\u7535\u6d41\u4e32\u8054\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6709\u6e90\u6865\u4f9b\u7535\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5904\u7406\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u7535\u538b\u5373\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u5927\u529f\u7387\u6d41\u3002\u53ef\u9009\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u6c60\u50a8\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7535\u538b\u6ce8\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u9988\u7ebf\u7535\u6d41\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u65e0\u529f\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u529f\u7387\u56e0\u6570\u6539\u5584\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4f7f\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u6210\u672c\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u8017\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6539\u5584\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e09\u500d\u3002\u5b9e\u65f6\u786c\u4ef6\u5728\u73af\u548c\u539f\u578b\u6d4b\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u5728AC/DC\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u80fd\u91cf\u8def\u7531\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u6269\u5c55\u7535\u7f51\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u529f\u7387\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u7535\u538b\u548c\u7535\u80fd\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u6df7\u5408AC/DC\u7535\u7f51\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

A key challenge is developing online data-driven control algorithms for time-varying systems, especially when the system's complexity is unknown or changes over time. To address this, we propose a novel online subspace learning framework that operates on flag manifolds. Our algorithm leverages streaming data to recursively track an ensemble of nested subspaces, allowing it to adapt to varying system dimensions without prior knowledge of the true model order. We show that our algorithm is a generalization of the Grassmannian Recursive Algorithm for Tracking. The learned subspace models are then integrated into a data-driven simulation framework to perform prediction for unknown dynamical systems. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through a case study where the proposed adaptive predictor successfully handles abrupt changes in system dynamics and outperforms several baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65d7\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5df2\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u9636\u6570\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u672a\u77e5\u6216\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u65d7\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5f00\u53d1\u5728\u7ebf\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u9012\u5f52\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5d4c\u5957\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u77e5\u9053\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u9636\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u662fGrassmannian\u9012\u5f52\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u5728\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We analyze constitutional, collective-choice, and operational rules shaping AI uptake in two contrasting GCC members, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait, and whether they foster citizen centricity, collaborative governance, and public value creation. Anchored in Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework, the study combines a most similar/most different systems design with multiple sources: 62 public documents from 2018--2025, embedded UAE cases (Smart Dubai and MBZUAI), and 39 interviews with officials conducted Aug 2024--May 2025. Dual coding and process tracing connect rule configurations to AI performance. Cross-case analysis identifies four reinforcing mechanisms behind divergent trajectories. In the UAE, concentrated authority, credible sanctions, pro-innovation narratives, and flexible reinvestment rules scale pilots into hundreds of services and sizable recycled savings. In Kuwait, dispersed veto points, exhortative sanctions, cautious discourse, and lapsed AI budgets confine initiatives to pilot mode despite equivalent fiscal resources. The findings refine institutional theory by showing that vertical rule coherence, not wealth, determines AI's public-value yield, and temper post-NPM optimism by revealing that efficiency metrics serve societal goals only when backed by enforceable safeguards. To curb ethics washing and test transferability beyond the GCC, future work should track rule diffusion over time, develop blended legitimacy--efficiency scorecards, and examine how narrative framing shapes citizen consent for data sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6d77\u6e7e\u5408\u4f5c\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\uff08GCC\uff09\u56fd\u5bb6\u963f\u8054\u914b\u548c\u79d1\u5a01\u7279\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5782\u76f4\u89c4\u5219\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u800c\u975e\u8d22\u5bcc\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86AI\u7684\u516c\u5171\u4ef7\u503c\u4ea7\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76GCC\u56fd\u5bb6\u5982\u4f55\u5c06AI\u96c4\u5fc3\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u540e\u65b0\u516c\u5171\u7ba1\u7406\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u897f\u65b9\u6c11\u4e3b\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u5bf9GCC\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5965\u65af\u7279\u7f57\u59c6\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u76f8\u4f3c/\u6700\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u540862\u4efd\u516c\u5171\u6587\u4ef6\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u548c39\u6b21\u5b98\u5458\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u963f\u8054\u914b\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4e2d\u6743\u5a01\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u5236\u88c1\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u53d9\u4e8b\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u518d\u6295\u8d44\u89c4\u5219\u5c06\u8bd5\u70b9\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u6570\u767e\u9879\u670d\u52a1\uff1b\u79d1\u5a01\u7279\u56e0\u5206\u6563\u5426\u51b3\u70b9\u3001\u529d\u8beb\u6027\u5236\u88c1\u3001\u8c28\u614e\u8bdd\u8bed\u548c\u5931\u6548AI\u9884\u7b97\u800c\u5c06\u5021\u8bae\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u8bd5\u70b9\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5782\u76f4\u89c4\u5219\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u51b3\u5b9aAI\u7684\u516c\u5171\u4ef7\u503c\u4ea7\u51fa\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u6709\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4fdd\u969c\u65f6\u624d\u670d\u52a1\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u8ffd\u8e2a\u89c4\u5219\u6269\u6563\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u5408\u6cd5\u6027-\u6548\u7387\u8bc4\u5206\u5361\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u53d9\u4e8b\u6846\u67b6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u6c11\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u540c\u610f\u3002"}}

However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $\u03bc$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

Here, we are given as input a design matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ and measurements or labels ${y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ where ${y} = {X} {w}^* + \u03be$, and $\u03be$ is the noise in the measurements. Importantly, we have the additional constraint that the unknown signal vector ${w}^*$ is sparse: it has $k$ non-zero entries where $k$ is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Our goal is to output a prediction vector $\\widehat{w}$ that has small prediction error: $\\frac{1}{N}\\cdot \\|{X} {w}^* - {X} \\widehat{w}\\|^2_2$.\n  Information-theoretically, we know what is best possible in terms of measurements: under most natural noise distributions, we can get prediction error at most $\u03b5$ with roughly $N = O(k \\log d/\u03b5)$ samples. Computationally, this currently needs $d^{\u03a9(k)}$ run-time. Alternately, with $N = O(d)$, we can get polynomial-time. Thus, there is an exponential gap (in the dependence on $d$) between the two and we do not know if it is possible to get $d^{o(k)}$ run-time and $o(d)$ samples.\n  We give the first generic positive result for worst-case design matrices ${X}$: For any ${X}$, we show that if the support of ${w}^*$ is chosen at random, we can get prediction error $\u03b5$ with $N = \\text{poly}(k, \\log d, 1/\u03b5)$ samples and run-time $\\text{poly}(d,N)$. This run-time holds for any design matrix ${X}$ with condition number up to $2^{\\text{poly}(d)}$.\n  Previously, such results were known for worst-case ${w}^*$, but only for random design matrices from well-behaved families, matrices that have a very low condition number ($\\text{poly}(\\log d)$; e.g., as studied in compressed sensing), or those with special structural properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u901a\u7528\u6b63\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u03b5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6837\u672c\u6570poly(k, log d, 1/\u03b5)\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(k log d/\u03b5)\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u9700\u8981d^\u03a9(k)\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u9700\u8981O(d)\u6837\u672c\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u6216\u7279\u6b8a\u7ed3\u6784\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "method": "\u5047\u8bbew*\u7684\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u662f\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc72^poly(d)\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635X\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528poly(k, log d, 1/\u03b5)\u6837\u672c\u548cpoly(d,N)\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3apoly(k, log d, 1/\u03b5)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u7f16\u8f91\u8870\u51cf\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5b58\u6d3b\u7387\u56e0\u914d\u7f6e\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dAlphaEdit\u6bd4MEMIT\u8870\u51cf\u66f4\u591a\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u8f7b\u5fae\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\uff1a1) \u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5df2\u6709\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u8f91\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u672c\uff1b2) \u7f16\u8f91\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u6076\u610f\u7f16\u8f91\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5(MEMIT\u3001AlphaEdit)\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5(\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u3001LoRA\u3001DoRA)\uff0c\u57285\u4e2aLLM\u548c3\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c232\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u7f16\u8f91\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u786e\u5b9e\u4f1a\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5b58\u6d3b\u7387\u56e0\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u5f02\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03(\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u7f16\u8f91\u5c42)\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u8f7b\u5fae\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u975e\u7f16\u8f91\u5c42\u6bd4\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u7834\u574f\u66f4\u591a\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6574\u5408\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u5b8c\u6574\u7684LLM\u5e94\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

However, communication efficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for large-scale models. In this work, we introduce two complementary algorithms: ProjFL, designed for unbiased compressors, and ProjFL+EF, tailored for biased compressors through an Error Feedback mechanism. Both methods rely on projecting local gradients onto a shared client-server subspace spanned by historical descent directions, enabling efficient information exchange with minimal communication overhead.

To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations.

Over these 15 years, it has grown from a purely competition-focused site into a broader ecosystem with forums, notebooks, models, datasets, and more. With the release of the Kaggle Meta Code and Kaggle Meta Datasets, we now have a unique opportunity to explore these competitions, technologies, and real-world applications of Machine Learning and AI. And so in this study, we take a closer look at 15 years of data science on Kaggle - through metadata, shared code, community discussions, and the competitions themselves. We explore Kaggle's growth, its impact on the data science community, uncover hidden technological trends, analyze competition winners, how Kagglers approach problems in general, and more. We do this by analyzing millions of kernels and discussion threads to perform both longitudinal trend analysis and standard exploratory data analysis. Our findings show that Kaggle is a steadily growing platform with increasingly diverse use cases, and that Kagglers are quick to adapt to new trends and apply them to real-world challenges, while producing - on average - models with solid generalization capabilities. We also offer a snapshot of the platform as a whole, highlighting its history and technological evolution.

In this paper, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that integrates advanced soft computing techniques - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) - to address the multidimensional challenges of predictive maintenance in complex manufacturing systems. Specifically, the proposed framework innovatively combines the powerful frequency-domain representation capability of FNOs to capture high-dimensional temporal patterns; DAEs to achieve robust, noise-resistant latent state embedding from complex non-Gaussian sensor data; and GNNs to accurately represent inter-device dependencies for coordinated system-wide maintenance decisions. Furthermore, by exploiting PPO, the framework ensures stable and efficient optimisation of long-term maintenance strategies to effectively handle uncertainty and non-stationary dynamics.

However, it has been established that the charging of EVs can destabilize the grid when they penetrate the market in large numbers, especially in grids that were not initially built to handle the load from the charging of EVs. In this work, we present a dynamic EV charging pricing strategy that fulfills the following three objectives: distribution network-level load peak-shaving, valley-filling, and load balancing across distribution networks. Based on historical environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, EV charging prices and distribution of vehicles in different areas in different times of the day, we first forecast the distribution network load demand, and then use deep reinforcement learning approach to set the optimal dynamic EV charging price. While most research seeks to achieve load peak-shaving and valley-filling to stabilize the grid, our work goes further into exploring the load-balancing between the distribution networks in the close vicinity to each other. We compare the performance of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms for this purpose. The best algorithm is used for dymamic EV pricing. Simulation results show an improved utilization of the grid at the distribution network level, leading to the optimal usage of the grid on a larger scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u8d1f\u8377\u524a\u5cf0\u586b\u8c37\u548c\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u8d1f\u8377\u5e73\u8861", "motivation": "\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u666e\u53ca\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u7535\u7f51\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9020\u6210\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u539f\u672c\u672a\u8003\u8651EV\u5145\u7535\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u8d1f\u8377\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DDPG\u3001SAC\u3001PPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u5145\u7535\u5b9a\u4ef7", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u5c42\u9762\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7535\u7f51\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u4f18\u5316\u4f7f\u7528", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001EV\u5145\u7535\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u7535\u7f51\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d1f\u8377\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5229\u7528"}}

Recent research has increasingly focused on developing such simulated agents to capture a range of learning styles, cognitive development pathways, and social behaviours. Among contemporary simulation techniques, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational research has emerged as a particularly versatile and scalable paradigm. LLMs afford a high degree of linguistic realism and behavioural adaptability, enabling agents to approximate cognitive processes and engage in contextually appropriate pedagogical dialogues. This paper presents a thematic review of empirical and methodological studies utilising LLMs to simulate student behaviour across educational environments. We synthesise current evidence on the capacity of LLM-based agents to emulate learner archetypes, respond to instructional inputs, and interact within multi-agent classroom scenarios. Furthermore, we examine the implications of such systems for curriculum development, instructional evaluation, and teacher training. While LLMs surpass rule-based systems in natural language generation and situational flexibility, ongoing concerns persist regarding algorithmic bias, evaluation reliability, and alignment with educational objectives.

Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting.

The basic minimum requirement for the choice of a sensor set while designing Kalman filters is that all states are observable. In addition, the sensors should be chosen with a view towards estimating the states with a desired accuracy. Often observability is treated as true/false check during filter design. Beyond observability -- the observability degree -- which measures \\emph{how observable} the states are, has been used as the metric of choice to for sensor selection or placement applications. The higher the degree of observability, the better the possibility of designing Kalman filters that achieve the desired state estimation accuracy and consistency requirements. When a wide variety of sensors are available, sometimes with cost and physical constraints involved, sensor selection plays a crucial role in filter design. In such situations it is important to know the expected contribution of each sensor towards observability degree. Shapley values, developed in cooperative game theory for fair allocation of the payout of a multi-player game to individual players, are widely used in machine learning to assess feature importance. This paper shows that Shapley values can indeed be leveraged to quantify the expected marginal contribution of each sensor in any given sensor set towards the observability degree. This quantification of the fair contribution of each sensor towards the observability degree can be leveraged by filter designers for sensor selection, placement and filter (state estimator) design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684Shapley\u503c\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\uff08\u771f/\u5047\u5224\u65ad\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5f53\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684Shapley\u503c\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\u3002Shapley\u503c\u539f\u672c\u7528\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u591a\u4eba\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eShapley\u503c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u4efb\u610f\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u671f\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "Shapley\u503c\u4e3a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Many outpatient clinics have implemented two-stage service systems, with both a physician and physician assistant, to enhance capacity and reduce costs. Some patients only visit a physician assistant while some patients visit both providers depending on their patient type. However, minimizing provider idle time and overtime while reducing patient waiting time is challenging in two-stage service systems. Thus, our objective is to find daily appointment templates, based on block scheduling, that minimize a weighted sum of these metrics. A block schedule divides the overall schedule into several time blocks and assigns patients of different types into each block in proportion to their daily demand to balance the workload throughout the day. Since the problem is shown to be strongly $\\mathcal{NP}$-Hard, we develop a heuristic algorithm that provides a no-idle time appointment template that is easily implementable. We expand our study to include stochastic service times and show that our algorithm yields an efficient block schedule under practically relevant conditions. The algorithm is able to provide a solution similar in cost to the stochastic model when patient wait time costs are low by maintaining lower physician idle times with at most a 16 minute/patient increase in patient wait times. Comparing our heuristic to a First Come, First Appointment scheduling rule, we show that our heuristic is able to better minimize provider idle time, which mimics many real-life settings where clinics prioritize the efficiency of the healthcare providers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u533b\u7597\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u7ea6\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u533b\u751f\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u52a0\u73ed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u603b\u548c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u662f\u5168\u7403\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u533b\u751f\u548c\u533b\u751f\u52a9\u7406\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5e73\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u52a0\u73ed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6574\u4f53\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5757\uff0c\u6309\u60a3\u8005\u7c7b\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5206\u914d\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65e0\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u9884\u7ea6\u6a21\u677f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u968f\u673a\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u60a3\u8005\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u589e\u52a016\u5206\u949f/\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u4f46\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u533b\u751f\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u5230\u5148\u670d\u52a1\u89c4\u5219\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u533b\u7597\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u7ea6\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u533b\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u6548\u7387\u7684\u8bca\u6240\u3002"}}

In this paper, we argue that the predominant approach of simply removing existing biases from models is not enough. Using a paradigm from the psychology literature, we demonstrate that LLMs can spontaneously develop novel social biases about artificial demographic groups even when no inherent differences exist. These biases result in highly stratified task allocations, which are less fair than assignments by human participants and are exacerbated by newer and larger models. In social science, emergent biases like these have been shown to result from exploration-exploitation trade-offs, where the decision-maker explores too little, allowing early observations to strongly influence impressions about entire demographic groups. To alleviate this effect, we examine a series of interventions targeting model inputs, problem structure, and explicit steering. We find that explicitly incentivizing exploration most robustly reduces stratification, highlighting the need for better multifaceted objectives to mitigate bias. These results reveal that LLMs are not merely passive mirrors of human social biases, but can actively create new ones from experience, raising urgent questions about how these systems will shape societies over time.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u5173\u4e8e\u865a\u6784\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u660e\u786e\u6fc0\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u6700\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u88ab\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u80fd\u591f\u505a\u51fa\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b83\u4eec\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u53d8\u5f97\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u5df2\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u4e0d\u591f\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5bf9\u865a\u6784\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u504f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u660e\u786e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u786e\u5b9e\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u3002\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u660e\u786e\u6fc0\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u53cd\u6620\u8005\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5851\u9020\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time.

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system.

Each hood is numerically modeled with a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA), using 1.2M cells in total to ensure spatial and temporal accuracy. The dataset provides time-resolved physical fields, along with STL meshes and structured natural language prompts for text-to-geometry synthesis. Existing datasets are either confined to 2D cases, exhibit limited geometric variations, or lack the multi-modal annotations and data structures - shortcomings we address with AutoHood3D. We validate our numerical methodology, establish quantitative baselines across five neural architectures, and demonstrate systematic surrogate errors in displacement and force predictions. These findings motivate the design of novel approaches and multiphysics loss functions that enforce fluid-solid coupling during model training.

This construct leads to increased approximation accuracy of the state transition tensors and improved Gaussian moment propagation for nonlinear flight scenarios like aerocapture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u79e9-1\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\u7684z-\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\u7684z-\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u6784\u9020\u6700\u4f18\u79e9-1\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5728Frobenius\u8303\u6570\u610f\u4e49\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u98de\u884c\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u6c14\u52a8\u6355\u83b7\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u77e9\u4f20\u64ad\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u4f18\u79e9-1\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\u662f\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

In particular, Bot-Fadili-Nguyen prove weak convergence of discrete accelerated gradient descent (AGD) iterates and, crucially, convergence of the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method in the composite setting, with extensions to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In parallel, Jang-Ryu establish point convergence for the continuous-time accelerated flow and for discrete AGD in finite dimensions.\n  These results leave open which minimizer is selected by the iterates. We answer this in the affine-quadratic setting: when initialized at the same point, the difference between the proximal gradient (PGM) and APG iterates converges weakly to zero. Consequently, APG converges weakly to the best approximation of the initial point in the solution set. Moreover, under mild assumptions on the parameter sequence, we obtain strong convergence of APG.

Using synchronized tracking and event data from the 2023-24 LaLiga season, 2,413 defensive sequences were analyzed following possession losses by FC Barcelona and Real Madrid CF. Two-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of team, outcome, and their interaction for key indicators, with relative line height showing the strongest association with defensive success. Predictive modeling using XGBoost achieved the highest discriminative performance (ROC AUC: 0.724 for Barcelona, 0.698 for Real Madrid), identifying space score and relative line height as dominant predictors. Comparative analysis revealed distinct team-specific defensive behaviors: Barcelona's success was characterized by higher spatial control and compact line coordination, whereas Real Madrid exhibited more adaptive but less consistent defensive structures.

Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment.

We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement \"code 57.95 refers to urinary infection\") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., \"what is code 57.95\") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0d\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8eRL\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u2014\u2014\u5373RL\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22RL\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfcSFT\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83RL\u548cSFT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "RL\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548cSFT\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u7f29\u5c0f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1bRL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8def\u5f84\u56de\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aRL\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u77e5\u8bc6\u904d\u5386\u65b9\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6280\u80fd\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u83b7\u53d6\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002"}}

We present FiCABU (Fisher-based Context-Adaptive Balanced Unlearning), a software-hardware co-design that brings unlearning to edge AI processors. FiCABU combines (i) Context-Adaptive Unlearning, which begins edits from back-end layers and halts once the target forgetting is reached, with (ii) Balanced Dampening, which scales dampening strength by depth to preserve retain accuracy. These methods are realized in a full RTL design of a RISC-V edge AI processor that integrates two lightweight IPs for Fisher estimation and dampening into a GEMM-centric streaming pipeline, validated on an FPGA prototype and synthesized in 45 nm for power analysis. Across CIFAR-20 and PinsFaceRecognition with ResNet-18 and ViT, FiCABU achieves random-guess forget accuracy while matching the retraining-free Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) baseline on retain accuracy, reducing computation by up to 87.52 percent (ResNet-18) and 71.03 percent (ViT). On the INT8 hardware prototype, FiCABU further improves retain preservation and reduces energy to 6.48 percent (CIFAR-20) and 0.13 percent (PinsFaceRecognition) of the SSD baseline.

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3transformer\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5934\u6765\u5229\u7528LLM\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u9886\u57df\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5934\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u6807\u7b7e\u7531\u66f4\u5927LLM\u6216\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0cUHeads\u6027\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u6bd4\u5176\u5927810\u500d\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5c11\u4e8e1000\u4e07\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u5176\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u7701LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While transfer learning has been extensively studied in traditional classification, transfer learning in imbalanced classification such as Neyman-Pearson classification has received much less attention. This setting poses unique challenges, as both types of errors must be simultaneously controlled.

Lightning stroke simulations were conducted at various distances from the solar power plant along the transmission line, considering scenarios with and without surge arrester. Key lightning parameters such as peak current, front time, and tail time were varied to simulate different lightning strokes. The study also includes a Fourier transform analysis of the resulting overvoltages with and without a surge arrester, along with the Hilbert marginal spectrum of these overvoltages.

Despite the popularity and the success of Adam it remains an \\emph{open research problem} to provide a rigorous convergence analysis for Adam even for the class of strongly convex SOPs. In one of the main results of this work we establish convergence rates for Adam in terms of the number of gradient steps (convergence rate \\nicefrac{1}{2} w.r.t. the size of the learning rate), the size of the mini-batches (convergence rate 1 w.r.t. the size of the mini-batches), and the size of the second moment parameter of Adam (convergence rate 1 w.r.t. the distance of the second moment parameter to 1) for the class of strongly convex SOPs. In a further main result of this work, which we refer to as \\emph{Adam symmetry theorem}, we illustrate the optimality of the established convergence rates by proving for a special class of simple quadratic strongly convex SOPs that Adam converges as the number of gradient steps increases to infinity to the solution of the SOP (the unique minimizer of the strongly convex objective function) if and \\emph{only} if the random variables in the SOP (the data in the SOP) are \\emph{symmetrically distributed}. In particular, in the standard case where the random variables in the SOP are not symmetrically distributed we \\emph{disprove} that Adam converges to the minimizer of the SOP as the number of Adam steps increases to infinity.

In this paper, we examine the psychological and opinion barriers that limit engagement with extinction narratives, such as mortality avoidance, exponential growth bias, and the absence of self-referential anchors. We contrast them with evidence that public concern over AI rises when framed in terms of proximate harms such as employment disruption, relational instability, and mental health issues. We validate these findings through actual message testing with 1063 respondents, with the evidence showing that AI risks to Jobs and Children have the highest potential to mobilize people, while Existential Risk is the lowest-performing theme across all demographics.

Existing methods typically presuppose perfect priors or can only handle specific, pre-identified error types. And their performance degrades substantially when confronted with flawed constraints of unknown location and type. This decline arises because most of them rely on inflexible and biased thresholding strategies that may conflict with the data distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives. Our proposed method is robust to both linear and nonlinear settings. Extensive experiments, conducted under diverse noise conditions and structural equation model types, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method under imperfect structural constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u6765\u534f\u8c03\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5f53\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u7a00\u758f\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8054\u5408\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u3002"}}

Although various approaches have been proposed to mitigate entropy collapse, a comprehensive study of entropy in RLVR remains lacking. To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR.

Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads. The MLCommons Science Benchmarks Ontology provides a standardized, scalable foundation for reproducible, cross-domain benchmarking in scientific machine learning.

Ehrhardt"], "title": "Bilevel Learning via Inexact Stochastic Gradient Descent", "comment": null, "summary": "Bilevel optimization is a central tool in machine learning for high-dimensional hyperparameter tuning. Its applications are vast; for instance, in imaging it can be used for learning data-adaptive regularizers and optimizing forward operators in variational regularization. These problems are large in many ways: a lot of data is usually available to train a large number of parameters, calling for stochastic gradient-based algorithms. However, exact gradients with respect to parameters (so-called hypergradients) are not available, and their precision is usually linearly related to computational cost. Hence, algorithms must solve the problem efficiently without unnecessary precision. The design of such methods is still not fully understood, especially regarding how accuracy requirements and step size schedules affect theoretical guarantees and practical performance. Existing approaches introduce stochasticity at both the upper level (e.g., in sampling or mini-batch estimates) and the lower level (e.g., in solving the inner problem) to improve generalization, but they typically fix the number of lower-level iterations, which conflicts with asymptotic convergence assumptions. In this work, we advance the theory of inexact stochastic bilevel optimization. We prove convergence and establish rates under decaying accuracy and step size schedules, showing that with optimal configurations convergence occurs at an $\\mathcal{O}(k^{-1/4})$ rate in expectation. Experiments on image denoising and inpainting with convex ridge regularizers and input-convex networks confirm our analysis: decreasing step sizes improve stability, accuracy scheduling is more critical than step size strategy, and adaptive preconditioning (e.g., Adam) further boosts performance. These results bridge theory and practice, providing convergence guarantees and practical guidance for large-scale imaging problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8870\u51cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6b65\u957f\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230O(k^{-1/4})\u7684\u671f\u671b\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6210\u50cf\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e0b\u5c42\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8870\u51cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6b65\u957f\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u6b65\u957f\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51f8\u5cad\u6b63\u5219\u5668\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u51f8\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230O(k^{-1/4})\u7684\u671f\u671b\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8870\u51cf\u6b65\u957f\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8c03\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6b65\u957f\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982Adam\uff09\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6210\u50cf\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6b65\u957f\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Quantifying these differences is critical to understanding if the quality of the legal information obtained by users of LLM-based chatbots varies depending on their location. However, obtaining meaningful comparative metrics is challenging because legal institutions in different places are not themselves easily comparable. In this work we propose a methodology to obtain place-to-place metrics based on the comparative law concept of functionalism. We construct a dataset of factual scenarios drawn from Reddit posts by users seeking legal advice for family, housing, employment, crime and traffic issues. We use these to elicit a summary of a law from the LLM relevant to each scenario in Los Angeles, London and Sydney. These summaries, typically of a legislative provision, are manually evaluated for hallucinations. We show that the rate of hallucination of legal information by leading closed-source LLMs is significantly associated with place. This suggests that the quality of legal solutions provided by these models is not evenly distributed across geography. Additionally, we show a strong negative correlation between hallucination rate and the frequency of the majority response when the LLM is sampled multiple times, suggesting a measure of uncertainty of model predictions of legal facts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u6bd4\u8f83\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u77e5\u8bc6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u3001\u4f26\u6566\u548c\u6089\u5c3c\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5730\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3LLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u5730\u533a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u6cd5\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6765\u81eaReddit\u7528\u6237\u5bfb\u6c42\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u3001\u4f26\u6566\u548c\u6089\u5c3c\u6d4b\u8bd5LLM\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6761\u6b3e\u7684\u603b\u7ed3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u5148\u7684\u95ed\u6e90LLM\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5730\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u591a\u6570\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u9891\u7387\u5448\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u5730\u7406\u4e0a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002"}}

To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions. This work offers a promising solution for reliable and accurate accident anticipation in complex traffic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faROAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8b\u6545\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u3001\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u3001\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u9677\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u8f66\u8f86\u7c7b\u578b\u95f4\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4e8b\u6545\u7387\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362(DWT)\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8f66\u8f86\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u4ea4\u901a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u7f13\u89e3\u6b63\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD)\u3001Car Crash Dataset (CCD)\u548cAnAn Accident Detection (A3D)\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6(AP)\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u4e8b\u6545\u65f6\u95f4(mTTA)\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ROAR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u3001\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u51c6\u786e\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing machine unlearning algorithms frequently neglect the fact that different data points may contribute unequally to model performance (i.e., heterogeneous data values). Treat them equally in machine unlearning procedure can potentially degrading the performance of updated models. To address this limitation, we propose Data Value-Weighted Unlearning (DVWU), a general unlearning framework that accounts for data value heterogeneity into the unlearning process. Specifically, we design a weighting strategy based on data values, which are then integrated into the unlearning procedure to enable differentiated unlearning for data points with varying utility to the model. The DVWU framework can be broadly adapted to various existing machine unlearning methods. We use the one-step Newton update as an example for implementation, developing both output and objective perturbation algorithms to achieve certified unlearning. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods achieve superior predictive performance and robustness compared to conventional unlearning approaches. We further show the extensibility of our framework on gradient ascent method by incorporating the proposed weighting strategy into the gradient terms, highlighting the adaptability of DVWU for broader gradient-based deep unlearning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6DVWU\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u7b49\u5904\u7406\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u4ee5\u4e00\u6b65\u725b\u987f\u66f4\u65b0\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6270\u52a8\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DVWU\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86wa-hls4ml\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30ML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u548ctransformer\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4bFPGA\u4e0aML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u7efc\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6210\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5feb\u901f\u4f30\u8ba1ML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b68\u4e07\u591a\u4e2a\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684wa-hls4ml\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528hls4ml\u5de5\u5177\u9488\u5bf9Xilinx FPGA\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u548ctransformer\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u5728\u5408\u6210\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u5185\u9884\u6d4b75%\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "wa-hls4ml\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3ML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u7efc\u5408\u74f6\u9888\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002"}}

We jointly answer two resilience-related research questions: (Q1) Survivability: Upon having an extreme event/contingency, will the system remain feasible with voltage staying within a (preferred) safe range? (Q2) Dominant Vulnerability: If voltage collapses, what are the dominant sources of system vulnerabilities responsible for the failure? This highlights some key locations worth paying attention to in the planning or decision-making process. To address these questions, we propose a voltage-regulated sparse optimization that finds a minimal set of bus locations along with quantified compensations (corrective actions) that can simultaneously enforce AC network balance and voltage bounds. Results on transmission systems of varying sizes (30-bus to 2383-bus) demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates voltage collapses by compensating at only a few strategically identified nodes, while scaling efficiently to large systems, taking on average less than 4 min for 2000+ bus cases.

In the MFC case, to rigorously identify the limit, we introduce a discretization of the state and action spaces, following the approach used in the finite-space case in [Angiuli et al., 2023b]. The convergence proofs rely on a generalization of the two-timescale framework introduced in [Borkar, 1997].

Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety. By bridging theory and practice, GAIA offers a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "GAIA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411B2B\u8c08\u5224\u548c\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u4f18\u5148\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u53cd\u9988\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u6388\u6743\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u786e\u4fddAI\u59d4\u6258\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u5728B2B\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u5230\u6cbb\u7406\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u3001\u786e\u4fdd\u5145\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c08\u5224\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u5982\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u660e\u786e\u6388\u6743\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53cd\u9988\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "method": "GAIA\u6846\u67b6\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u59d4\u6258\u4eba\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u548c\u5bf9\u624b\u65b9\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4fe1\u606f\u95e8\u63a7\u8fdb\u5c55\uff08\u5206\u79bb\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u8c08\u5224\uff09\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u53cd\u9988\u96c6\u6210\uff08AI\u6279\u8bc4\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u4fee\u6b63\u7ed3\u5408\uff09\u3001\u6388\u6743\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u660e\u786e\u5347\u7ea7\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u660e\u786e\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u6e20\u9053\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u59d4\u6258\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "GAIA\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u63a5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7684\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u91c7\u8d2d\u3001\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u548c\u4eba\u5458\u914d\u7f6e\u7b49\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23\u7684AI\u59d4\u6258\u3002"}}

Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "iTimER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u6765\u63d2\u8865\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u6216\u63a8\u65ad\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8be5\u8bef\u5dee\u9690\u542b\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b", "method": "iTimER\u5efa\u6a21\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u6700\u540e\u53ef\u7528\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Wasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0ciTimER\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "iTimER\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd"}}

Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality. The trained reward model then guides GRPO fine-tuning to optimize model outputs along these ethical dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in bias intensity and improved alignment with non-discriminatory standards without compromising fluency or informativeness.

Each DG employs a hierarchical architecture combining local controllers for voltage regulation and distributed controllers for droop-free power sharing through normalized power consensus. By leveraging dissipativity theory, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for subsystem passivity and cast the co-design problem as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization, enabling efficient computation and guaranteed stability. Our framework systematically synthesizes sparse communication topologies while handling the coupled dq-frame dynamics and dual power flow objectives inherent to AC MGs. Simulation results on a representative AC MG demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving accurate voltage regulation, frequency synchronization, and proportional power sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8017\u6563\u6027\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4ea4\u6d41\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u538b\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u529f\u7387\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4ea4\u6d41\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u8026\u5408\u7684dq\u8f74\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u53cc\u529f\u7387\u6d41\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ed\u73af\u4ea4\u6d41\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8017\u6563\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u7acb\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6e90\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u51f8\u7ebf\u6027\u77e9\u9635\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5408\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4ea4\u6d41\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u4e0a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7535\u538b\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u9891\u7387\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u529f\u7387\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4ea4\u6d41\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

It is hotly debated whether data protection law applies to behavioural targeting. Many behavioural targeting companies say that, as long as they do not tie names to data they hold about individuals, they do not process any personal data, and that, therefore, data protection law does not apply to them. European Data Protection Authorities, however, take the view that a company processes personal data if it uses data to single out a person, even if it cannot tie a name to these data. This paper argues that data protection law should indeed apply to behavioural targeting. Companies can often tie a name to nameless data about individuals. Furthermore, behavioural targeting relies on collecting information about individuals, singling out individuals, and targeting ads to individuals. Many privacy risks remain, regardless of whether companies tie a name to the information they hold about a person. A name is merely one of the identifiers that can be tied to data about a person, and it is not even the most practical identifier for behavioural targeting. Seeing data used to single out a person as personal data fits the rationale for data protection law: protecting fairness and privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u5e94\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u8425\u9500\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u516c\u53f8\u672a\u5c06\u59d3\u540d\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u4e2a\u4eba\uff0c\u5c31\u5e94\u89c6\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u8425\u9500\u516c\u53f8\u58f0\u79f0\u53ea\u8981\u4e0d\u5c06\u59d3\u540d\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5c31\u4e0d\u5904\u7406\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u89c2\u70b9\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u76ee\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u8425\u9500\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u59d3\u540d\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u96c6\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2a\u4f53\u5e76\u5411\u5176\u6295\u653e\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6784\u6210\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u59d3\u540d\u53ea\u662f\u4f17\u591a\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u8425\u9500\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u5e94\u5f53\u9002\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u5e94\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u8425\u9500\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u6d3b\u52a8\u6d89\u53ca\u6536\u96c6\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u5e7f\u544a\u6295\u653e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d3b\u52a8\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u6784\u6210\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u4fdd\u62a4\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5b97\u65e8\u3002"}}

Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u91d1\u878d\u8868\u683c\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7247\u6bb5\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66b4\u9732\u5f53\u524d\u63d0\u793a\u5f31\u70b9\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u53cd\u9988\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728DocMath-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7eb3\u5165\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape.

Furthermore, random data missing due to communication failures, congestion, and cyberattacks, makes these methods easily infeasible. Inspired by recent advances in digital twins (DTs), this paper proposes an interactive attention-based DSSE model for robust grid monitoring by integrating three core components: physical entities, virtual modeling, and data fusion. To enable robustness against various data missing in heterogeneous measurements, we first propose physics-informed data augmentation and transfer. Moreover, a state-of-the-art attention-based spatiotemporal feature learning is proposed, followed by a novel cross-interaction feature fusion for robust voltage estimation.

While existing fairness-aware methods typically intervene at the model level, they often suffer from high computational costs, limited scalability, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian data selection framework that ensures fairness by aligning group-specific posterior distributions of model parameters and sample weights with a shared central distribution. Our framework supports flexible alignment via various distributional discrepancy measures, including Wasserstein distance, maximum mean discrepancy, and $f$-divergence, allowing geometry-aware control without imposing explicit fairness constraints. This data-centric approach mitigates group-specific biases in training data and improves fairness in downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees.

In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent \"effective weights\". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample. We posit that the evolution of these effective weights reveals fundamental principles of representation learning. Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge.

However, obtaining high-resolution CSI remains challenging in practical wireless communication systems. To address this issue, we propose to utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and score-based generative models to enable robust HBF under imperfect CSI conditions. Firstly, we develop the Hybrid Message Graph Attention Network (HMGAT) which updates both node and edge features through node-level and edge-level message passing. Secondly, we design a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based Noise Conditional Score Network (NCSN) to learn the distribution of high-resolution CSI, facilitating CSI generation and data augmentation to further improve HMGAT's performance. Finally, we present a Denoising Score Network (DSN) framework and its instantiation, termed DeBERT, which can denoise imperfect CSI under arbitrary channel error levels, thereby facilitating robust HBF.

We introduce several new classes of structured symmetric tensors: completely decomposable (CD) tensors, strictly sum of squares (SSOS) tensors and SOS$^*$ tensors.

SSOS tensors are defined as SOS tensors with a positive definite Gram matrix, ensuring structural stability under perturbations. The SOS$^*$ cone is defined as the dual cone of the SOS tensor cone, with characterizations via moment matrices and polynomial nonnegativity. We study the relations among completely positive (CP) cones, CD cones, sum of squares (SOS) cones, positive semidefinite (PSD) cones and copositive (COP) cones. We identify the interiors of PSD, SOS, CP, COP and CD cones for even-order tensors. These characterizations are crucial for interior-point methods and stability analysis in polynomial and tensor optimization. We generalize the classical Schur product theorem to CD and CP tensors, including the case of strongly completely decomposable (SCD) and strongly completely positive (SCP) tensors.

In the limit of infinitely large widths and small learning rate, the kernel that is obtained allows to represent the output of the learned model with a closed-form solution. This closed-form solution hinges on the invertibility of the limiting kernel, a property that often holds on real-world datasets. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of large ReLU networks to increasing depths by characterizing the corresponding limiting kernel. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the normalized limiting kernel approaches the matrix of ones. In contrast, they show the corresponding closed-form solution approaches a fixed limit on the sphere.

Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions.

While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SSTODE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d77\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u4f53\u8f93\u8fd0\u539f\u7406\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728SST\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6d77\u6c14\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d77\u6c34\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6d41\u4f53\u8f93\u8fd0\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfcODE\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u6d41\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u62df\u6d77\u6d0b\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u6062\u590d\u63a7\u5236SST\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6f5c\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d77\u6d0b\u70ed\u6536\u652f\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684EEI\u6a21\u5757\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u5f3a\u8feb\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u533a\u57dfSST\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u6d41\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u70ed\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u663c\u591c\u52a0\u70ed-\u51b7\u5374\u5faa\u73af\u5bf9SST\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "SSTODE\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3SST\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002"}}

However, the scarcity and imbalance of high fidelity fault data, especially for rare inverter malfunctions and extreme external line faults, limit dependable model training and validation. This paper introduces a unified framework that models a detailed inverter dominated microgrid and systematically generates multiple internal and external fault scenarios to mitigate data scarcity and class imbalance. An enhanced generative model called F2GAN (Feature Feedback GAN) is developed to synthesize high dimensional tabular fault data with improved realism and statistical alignment. Unlike conventional GANs, F2GAN integrates multi level feedback based on mean variance, correlation, and feature matching losses, enabling the generator to refine output distributions toward real fault feature spaces. The generated datasets are evaluated through quantitative and qualitative analyses. Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) experiments demonstrate strong generalization of machine learning classifiers trained exclusively on F2GAN samples. The framework is validated on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) fault diagnosis platform integrated with a real time simulator and graphical interface, achieving 100 % diagnostic accuracy under real-time testing.

Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

To this end, we propose \\textbf{ArchCraft}, a Framework that converts abstract architectural descriptions from academic papers into synthesizable Verilog projects with register-transfer level (RTL) verification. ArchCraft introduces a structured workflow, which uses formal graphs to capture the Architectural Blueprint and symbols to define the Functional Specification, translating unstructured academic papers into verifiable, hardware-aware designs. The framework then generates RTL and testbench (TB) code decoupled via these symbols to facilitate verification and debugging, ultimately reporting the circuit's Power, Area, and Performance (PPA). Moreover, we propose the first benchmark, \\textbf{ArchSynthBench}, for synthesizing hardware from architectural descriptions, with a complete set of evaluation indicators, 50 project-level circuits, and around 600 circuit blocks. We systematically assess ArchCraft on ArchSynthBench, where the experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, surpassing direct generation methods and the VerilogCoder framework in both paper understanding and code completion.

Conventional formulations aggregate multiple motivations into a single objective, implicitly assuming that these motivations are interchangeable. This paper challenges that assumption and proposes an opinion dynamics model grounded in a multi-objective game framework. In the proposed model, each individual experiences two distinct costs: social pressure from disagreement with others and cognitive dissonance from deviation from the perceived truth. Opinion updates are modeled as Pareto improvements between these two costs. This fwork provides a parsimonious explanation for the emergence of pluralistic ignorance, where individuals may agree on something untrue even though they all know the underlying truth. We analytically characterize the model, derive conditions for the emrameergence and prevalence of the truth, and propose an initial-seeding strategy that ensures consensus on truth. Numerical simulations are conducted on how network density and clustering affect the expression of truth. Both theoretical and numerical results lead to clear and non-trivial sociological insights.

However, these goals often conflict. We propose priority alignment, a new alignment paradigm that enforces a strict \"trustworthy-before-helpful\" ordering: optimization of helpfulness is conditioned on first meeting trustworthy thresholds (e.g., harmlessness or honesty). To realize this, we introduce Self-Priority Alignment (SPA)-a fully unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, self-evaluates them and refines them by the model itself, and applies dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistency and control variance. From this, SPA constructs lexicographically ordered preference pairs and fine-tunes the model using an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss that emphasizes high-confidence, high-gap decisions. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SPA improves helpfulness without compromising safety, outperforming strong baselines while preserving general capabilities.

A crucial question about AI reasoning is whether models can extrapolate learned reasoning patterns to solve harder tasks with longer chain-of-thought (CoT). In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on synthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for transformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive self-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem lengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that constant-depth transformers provably learn $\\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\\mathsf{TC}^0$, unless the widely held conjecture $\\mathsf{TC}^0 \\neq \\mathsf{NC}^1$ fails.

This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs.

We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match.

The architecture incorporates a cycle-length smoothing filter and confidence threshold to stabilize decisions. Results show that while several models achieved near-perfect offline accuracies (up to 99.9%), only the MLP sustained robust coverage (98-99%) under streaming, whereas ensembles preserved perfect anomaly precision but abstained frequently (10-49% coverage).

Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faAEPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\"\u56de\u58f0\u53cd\u5c04\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u53cd\u601d\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u5916\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u53cd\u601d\u9636\u6bb5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u673a\u68b0\u91cd\u590d\u65e9\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\"\u56de\u58f0\u53cd\u5c04\"", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(AEPO)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53cd\u601d\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u9632\u6b62\u9519\u8bef\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAEPO\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e3b\u6d41\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0", "conclusion": "AEPO\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53cd\u601d\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898"}}

In particular, a base controller ensures global or regional closed-loop l_p-stability of the error in tracking a desired equilibrium and the satisfaction of input and output constraints within a robustly positive invariant set. An additional control contribution, derived by combining the internal model control principle with a stable operator, is introduced to improve system performance. This operator, implemented as a stable neural network, can be trained via unconstrained optimisation on a chosen performance metric, without compromising closed-loop equilibrium tracking or constraint satisfaction, even if the optimisation is stopped prematurely. In addition, we characterise the class of closed-loop stable behaviours that can be achieved with the proposed architecture.

We propose a cost-efficient multi-agent judging framework that employs Small Language Models (SLMs) through structured debates among critic, defender, and judge agents. To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost. Ablation results show that three rounds of debate yield the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that structured, value-aligned debate enables SLMs to capture semantic nuances of jailbreak attacks and that HAJailBench offers a reliable foundation for scalable LLM safety evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u5224\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fa9\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b12,000\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6297\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u51c6HAJailBench\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5c16\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u3001\u8fa9\u62a4\u8005\u548c\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u4e09\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fa9\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728HAJailBench\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eGPT-4o\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e09\u8f6e\u8fa9\u8bba\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff0cHAJailBench\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DRRL) addresses this by optimizing for worst-case performance within an uncertainty set defined by a robustness budget $\u03b5$. However, fixing $\u03b5$ results in a tradeoff between performance and robustness: small values yield high nominal performance but weak robustness, while large values can result in instability and overly conservative policies. We propose Distributionally Robust Self-Paced Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (DR-SPCRL), a method that overcomes this limitation by treating $\u03b5$ as a continuous curriculum. DR-SPCRL adaptively schedules the robustness budget according to the agent's progress, enabling a balance between nominal and robust performance. Empirical results across multiple environments demonstrate that DR-SPCRL not only stabilizes training but also achieves a superior robustness-performance trade-off, yielding an average 11.8\\% increase in episodic return under varying perturbations compared to fixed or heuristic scheduling strategies, and achieving approximately 1.9$\\times$ the performance of the corresponding nominal RL algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DR-SPCRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\u03b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u540d\u4e49\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u56e0\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u800c\u5931\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfDRRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u56fa\u5b9a\u03b5\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u5883", "method": "\u5c06\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\u03b5\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u5c55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u81ea\u5b9a\u6b65\u8c03\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cDR-SPCRL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u56de\u62a5\u589e\u52a011.8%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u7ea6\u4e3a\u540d\u4e49RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u76841.9\u500d", "conclusion": "DR-SPCRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u03b5\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e73\u8861"}}

In systems and control theory, it provides key insights into the internal structure of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems and is closely linked to properties such as passivity, relaxation, and time-reversibility. This paper extends the concept of reciprocity to linear time-and-space-invariant (LTSI) systems, a class of infinite-dimensional systems with spatio-temporal dynamics. It is suggested that, analogously to the LTI case, combining the internal properties of reciprocity and (impedance) passivity entails physical state-space realizations. This is of particular relevance for infinite-dimensional systems, where issues of unboundedness can be detrimental to the well-posedness of the system.

In this work, we focus on Dutch language data from cancer patients. We extract metaphors used by patients using two data sources: (1) cancer patient storytelling interview data and (2) online forum data, including patients' posts, comments, and questions to professionals. We investigate how current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) perform on this task by exploring different prompting strategies such as chain of thought reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-prompting. With a human-in-the-loop setup, we verify the extracted metaphors and compile the outputs into a corpus named HealthQuote.NL.

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations.

The problem consists in describing the set of boundary traces generated by square-integrable controls over a finite or infinite time horizon. We show that these outputs form a precise functional space related to Gevrey regularity of order 2. In the infinite-time case, the trackable outputs are precisely those functions whose successive derivatives satisfy a weighted summability condition, which corresponds to specific Gevrey classes. For finite-time horizons, an additional compatibility condition involving the reachable space of the system provides a full characterization. The analysis relies on Fourier-Laplace transform, properties of Hardy spaces, the flatness method, and a new Plancherel-type theorem for Hilbert spaces of Gevrey functions. Beyond control theory, our results yield an optimal solution to the classical interpolation problem in Gevrey-$2$ classes, which improves results of Mitjagin on the optimal loss factor.

While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as \"inappropriate\" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for \"identity hate\". Second, I introduce an interactive pedagogical tool that makes these abstract biases tangible. The tool's core mechanic, a user-controlled \"sensitivity threshold,\" demonstrates that the biased score itself is not the only harm; instead, the more-concerning harm is the human-set, seemingly neutral policy that ultimately operationalises discrimination. This work provides both statistical evidence of disparate impact and a public-facing tool designed to foster critical AI literacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6559\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u975e\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u770b\u4f3c\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u6b67\u89c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5ba1\u6838\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u7ecf\u5e38\u5f00\u73a9\u7b11\u8bf4'AI\u6709\u504f\u89c1'\uff0c\u8fd9\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1AI\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u975e\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u82f1\u8bed(AAE)\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1)\u5bf9\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u6a21\u578b(unitary/toxic-bert)\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83AAE\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u7f8e\u56fd\u82f1\u8bed(SAE)\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2)\u5f00\u53d1\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6559\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u7684'\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u9608\u503c'\u673a\u5236\u4f7f\u62bd\u8c61\u504f\u89c1\u5177\u4f53\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u660e\u663e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff1a\u5e73\u5747\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9AAE\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u662fSAE\u76841.8\u500d\uff0c'\u8eab\u4efd\u4ec7\u6068'\u8bc4\u5206\u662fSAE\u76848.8\u500d\u3002\u4ea4\u4e92\u5de5\u5177\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u5206\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u66f4\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\u7684\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u770b\u4f3c\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u6700\u7ec8\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e86\u6b67\u89c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u53c8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u516c\u4f17\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u57f9\u517b\u6279\u5224\u6027AI\u7d20\u517b\uff0c\u63ed\u793aAI\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u6027\u540e\u679c\u3002"}}

However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies.

Our experiments using BookAsSumQA revealed that while LLM-based approaches showed higher accuracy on shorter texts, RAG-based methods become more effective as document length increases, making them more efficient and practical for aspect-based book summarization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BookAsSumQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u9762\u5411\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e66\u7c4d\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6458\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u6bd4LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5411\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6458\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e66\u7c4d\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u957f\u6587\u672c\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6458\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBookAsSumQA\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u53d9\u4e8b\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9762\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u6587\u6863\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0cRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u5411\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e66\u7c4d\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u672c\u7684\u9762\u5411\u65b9\u9762\u4e66\u7c4d\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cBookAsSumQA\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b64\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, the performance gain in the few-shot regime comes at the expense of significantly increased complexity and number of parameters. To circumvent this trade-off, we introduce TabDistill, a new strategy to distill the pre-trained knowledge in complex transformer-based models into simpler neural networks for effectively classifying tabular data. Our framework yields the best of both worlds: being parameter-efficient while performing well with limited training data.

Toward this, a distributed observable state-space model is derived, which paves the way for estimation and observability analysis of HDVs in mixed traffic scenarios. In this direction, first, we obtain the condition on the network topology to satisfy the distributed observability, i.e., the condition such that each HDV state is observable to every CAV via information-exchange over the network. It is shown that strong connectivity of the network, along with the proper design of the observer gain, is sufficient for this. A distributed observer is then designed by locally sharing estimates/observations of each CAV with its neighborhood. Second, in case there exist faulty sensors or unreliable observation data, we derive the condition for redundant distributed observability as a $q$-node/link-connected network design. This redundancy is achieved by extra information-sharing over the network and implies that a certain number of faulty sensors and unreliable links can be isolated/removed without losing the observability. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8054\u7f51\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u7f51\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4eba\u5de5\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u5197\u4f59\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u89c2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5f3a\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u589e\u76ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86q\u8282\u70b9/\u94fe\u8def\u8fde\u901a\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5197\u4f59\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7f51\u7edc\u5f3a\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u589e\u76ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5197\u4f59\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9694\u79bb/\u79fb\u9664\u4e00\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6545\u969c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u94fe\u8def\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5197\u4f59\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "MONICA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u540c\u610f\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\u548c\u8ffd\u968f\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMONICA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8c04\u5a9a\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u3002\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u8c04\u5a9a\u6f02\u79fb\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u5728\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc7\u9884\u8bbe\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u6291\u5236\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MONICA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To lower inference costs, prior works train router models or deferral mechanisms that allocate easy queries to a small, efficient model, while forwarding harder queries to larger, more expensive models. However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules.

We first justify this setup and show the significance of this problem through complexity analysis. We then establish both generalization upper bounds and minimax lower bounds which provide performance guarantees.

The reliable operation of Li-ion batteries depends critically on the accurate estimation of battery capacity. However, conventional estimation methods require extensive training datasets from costly battery tests for modeling, and a full cycle of charge and discharge is often needed to estimate the capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel capacity estimation method that leverages only one cycle of the open-circuit voltage (OCV) test in modeling and allows for estimating the capacity from partial charge or discharge data. Moreover, by applying it with OCV identification algorithms, we can estimate the capacity from dynamic discharge data without requiring dedicated data collection tests. We observed an invariance property in the OCV versus state of charge relationship across aging cycles. Leveraging this invariance, the proposed method estimates the capacity by solving an OCV alignment problem using only the OCV and the discharge capacity data from the battery. Simulation results demonstrate the method's efficacy, achieving a mean absolute relative error of 0.85\\% in capacity estimation across 12 samples from 344 aging cycles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u5f00\u8def\u7535\u538b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u5145\u653e\u7535\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u5bb9\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7OCV\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u5bb9\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u5145\u653e\u7535\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u6c60\u5bb9\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u5145\u653e\u7535\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528OCV-SOC\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u8001\u5316\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7OCV\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700OCV\u548c\u653e\u7535\u5bb9\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u52a8\u6001\u653e\u7535\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684344\u4e2a\u8001\u5316\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bb9\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.85%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u7535\u6c60\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

We propose Enhanced Dirichlet and Topology Risk (EDTR), a novel decoding strategy that combines topological analysis with Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification to measure LLM confidence across multiple reasoning paths. EDTR treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions: tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty.

EDTR achieves 41\\% better calibration than competing methods with an average ECE of 0.287 and the best overall composite score of 0.672, while notably achieving perfect accuracy on AIME and exceptional calibration on GSM8K with an ECE of 0.107, domains where baselines exhibit severe overconfidence.

While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines. Further analysis reveals that ICL performance in AD detection is highly sensitive to the alignment of label semantics and task-specific context, underscoring the importance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning under low-resource conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "EK-ICL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfICL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfICL\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u9886\u57df\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEK-ICL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u5206\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEK-ICL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u548cICL\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684ICL\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines. These results confirm that incorporating both structural and genetic features yields more accurate predictions of binding affinities, providing a reliable computational tool for accelerating the design of targeted therapies and vaccines in the context of gastrointestinal diseases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGastroDL-Fusion\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u75be\u75c5\u836f\u7269\u548c\u75ab\u82d7\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5f71\u54cd\u75be\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u7f51\u7edc(GIN)\u5efa\u6a21\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer(ProtBERT/ESM)\u7f16\u7801\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u610f\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u878d\u5408\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u9776\u70b9\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578bMAE\u4e3a1.12\uff0cRMSE\u4e3a1.75\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eCNN\u3001BiLSTM\u3001GIN\u548cTransformer-only\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540c\u65f6\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u75be\u75c5\u9776\u5411\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u75ab\u82d7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1Skipper\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3. \u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u6765\u62d2\u7edd\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u62bd\u8c61\u89c4\u5212\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Our assessment employs a fundamental principle from computational learning theory: a good explanation of data should also compress the data. We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle that searches for substructures that compress around three million biologically relevant molecules.

We also run our algorithm on 24 specific bioactivity prediction datasets to discover dataset-specific functional groups.

Furthermore, the conventional solution, which consists of decomposing signals using Fourier series and applying superposition, is a fragmented process that does not provide a unified solution in the frequency domain. This paper overcomes this limitation by introducing a complete and direct approach for multi-harmonic AC circuits using Geometric Algebra (GA). In this way, all non-sinusoidal voltage and current waveforms are represented as simple vectors in a $2N$-dimensional Euclidean space. The relationship between these vectors is characterized by a single and unified geometric transformation termed the \\textit{rotoflex}. This operator elevates the concept of impedance from a set of complex numbers per frequency to a single multivector that holistically captures the circuit response, while unifying the magnitude scale (flextance) and phase rotation (rotance) across all harmonics. Thus, this work establishes GA as a structurally unified and efficient alternative to phasor analysis, providing a more rigorous foundation for electrical circuit analysis. The methodology is validated through case studies that demonstrate perfect numerical consistency with traditional methods and superior performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u591a\u8c10\u6ce2\u4ea4\u6d41\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6b63\u5f26\u5355\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6b63\u5f26\u5355\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8c10\u6ce2\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7ea7\u6570\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u53e0\u52a0\u539f\u7406\u662f\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u9891\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u6570(GA)\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u591a\u8c10\u6ce2\u4ea4\u6d41\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u975e\u6b63\u5f26\u7535\u538b\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u6ce2\u5f62\u8868\u793a\u4e3a2N\u7ef4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\"rotoflex\"\u7b97\u5b50\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u963b\u6297\u6982\u5ff5\u4ece\u4e00\u7ec4\u6bcf\u9891\u7387\u590d\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u591a\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6355\u6349\u7535\u8def\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7edf\u4e00\u6240\u6709\u8c10\u6ce2\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e(flextance)\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u65cb\u8f6c(rotance)\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6570\u503c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this setting, edge costs are not fixed but depend on the specific trajectory selected through each convex region, making classical TSP methods inapplicable. We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios.

This paper present an overview of the CHIP 2025 Shared Task 2 competition, which aimed to develop state-of-the-art approaches for automatically recommending appro-priate discharge medications using real-world Chinese EHR data. For this task, we constructed CDrugRed, a high-quality dataset consisting of 5,894 de-identified hospitalization records from 3,190 patients in China. This task is challenging due to multi-label nature of medication recommendation, het-erogeneous clinical text, and patient-specific variability in treatment plans. A total of 526 teams registered, with 167 and 95 teams submitting valid results to the Phase A and Phase B leaderboards, respectively.

The central innovation of QiVC lies in its quantum-inspired rotated ensemble (QiRE) mechanism. QiRE performs differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogously to quantum state evolution. This approach enables structured uncertainty modeling while preserving the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, resulting in more expressive, stable, and uncertainty-aware representations. To demonstrate its practical potential, the concept is instantiated in a QiVC-based convolutional network (QiVC-Net) and evaluated in the context of biosignal classification, focusing on phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings, a challenging domain characterized by high noise, inter-subject variability, and often imbalanced data. The proposed QiVC-Net integrates an architecture in which the QiVC layer does not introduce additional parameters, instead performing an ensemble rotation of the convolutional weights through a structured mechanism ensuring robustness without added highly computational burden. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, PhysioNet CinC 2016 and PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope 2022, show that QiVC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching accuracies of 97.84% and 97.89%, respectively. These findings highlight the versatility of the QiVC framework and its promise for advancing uncertainty-aware modeling in real-world biomedical signal analysis.

DC microgrids have gained prominence due to their reduced conversion losses, simplified interfacing with DC-based RESs, and improved reliability. To manage the inherent variability of RESs and ensure stable operation, energy management systems (EMS) have become essential. While various EMS algorithms have been proposed and validated using real-time simulation platforms, most assume ideal communication conditions or rely on simplified network models, overlooking the impact of realistic communication delays on EMS performance. This paper presents a novel real-time cyber-physical system (CPS) testbed for evaluating EMS performance in DC microgrids under realistic communication delays. The proposed testbed integrates a DC microgrid modeled in OPAL-RT with an EMS controller implemented on a Raspberry Pi (RPi). The communication network is emulated using EXataCPS, enabling the exchange of actual power system traffic and the replication of realistic latency conditions.

We propose an active learning algorithm (\"PartiBandits\") to estimate $\\mathbb{E}[Y]$. The algorithm yields an estimate, $\\widehat\u03bc_{\\text{PB}}$, such that $\\left( \\widehat\u03bc_{\\text{PB}} - \\mathbb{E}[Y]\\right)^2$ is $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{\u03bd+ \\exp(c \\cdot (-N/\\log(N))) }{N} \\right)$, where $c > 0$ is a constant and $\u03bd$ is the risk of the Bayes-optimal classifier. PartiBandits is essentially a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it learns a partition of the unlabeled data that shrinks the average conditional variance of $Y$. In the second stage it uses a UCB-style subroutine (\"WarmStart-UCB\") to request labels from each stratum round-by-round. Both the main algorithm's and the subroutine's convergence rates are minimax optimal in classical settings. PartiBandits bridges the UCB and disagreement-based approaches to active learning despite these two approaches being designed to tackle very different tasks. We illustrate our methods through simulation using nationwide electronic health records.

In particular, we are interested in the structural sign (SS) herdability of a system wherein the underlying digraph representing it is signed. Structural herdability finds applications in various domains like power networks, biological networks, opinion dynamics, multi-robot shepherding, etc. We begin the analysis by introducing a layered graph representation Gs of the signed digraph G; such a representation allows us to capture the signed distances between the nodes with ease. We construct a subgraph of G_s that characterizes paths of identical signs between layers and uniform path lengths, referred to as a layer-wise unisigned graph LUG(G_s). A special subgraph of an LUG(G_s), denoted as an LUG^H(G_s), is key to achieving SS herdability. This is because we prove that an LTI system is SS herdable if and only if there exists an LUG^H(G_s) which covers all the nodes of the given digraph. To the best of our knowledge, such a graphical test is one of the first methods which allows us to check SS herdability for arbitrary digraph topologies. Interestingly, the analysis also reveals that a system can be SS herdable even in the presence of (signed and layer) dilation in the associated digraph (note that such a behaviour has been shown to be impossible in directed trees). Additionally, we also extend these results to digraphs with multiple leader and driver nodes.

Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph.

This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively.

While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \\textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling.

Traditionally operated as passive electrical loads, data centres, have the potential to become active participants that provide flexibility to the grid. However, quantifying and utilising this flexibility have not yet been fully explored. This paper presents an integrated, whole facility optimisation model to investigate the least cost operating schedule of data centres and characterise the aggregate flexibility available from data centres to the power system. The model accounts for IT workload shifting, UPS energy storage, and cooling system. Motivated by the need to alleviate the increasing strain on power systems while leveraging their untapped flexibility potential, this study makes two primary contributions: (i) an operational optimisation model that integrates IT scheduling, UPS operation, and cooling dynamics to establish a cost optimal baseline operation, and (ii) a duration-aware flexibility assessment that, for any given start time and power deviation, computes the maximum feasible duration from this baseline while respecting all operational, thermal, and recovery constraints. This method characterises the aggregate flexibility envelope. Results reveal a clear temporal structure and a notable asymmetry in flexibility provision: upward flexibility (electricity load reduction) is driven by deferring IT workload, which allows for a secondary reduction in cooling power. Downward flexibility (electricity load increase) relies on increasing power consumption of the cooling system, supported by the TES buffer, and charging the UPS. This framework translates abstract flexibility potential into quantified flexibility magnitude and duration that system operators could investigate for use in services such as reserve, frequency response, and price responsive demand.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5411\u7535\u7f51\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ecIT\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001UPS\u50a8\u80fd\u548c\u51b7\u5374\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u7ed9\u9ad8\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5177\u6709\u63d0\u4f9b\u7535\u7f51\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u6f5c\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u96c6\u6210IT\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001UPS\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u51b7\u5374\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u51c6\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u57fa\u51c6\u8fd0\u884c\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u5411\u4e0a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff08\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u51cf\u5c11\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u8fdfIT\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5411\u4e0b\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff08\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u589e\u52a0\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u51b7\u5374\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u8017\u589e\u52a0\u548cUPS\u5145\u7535\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u53ef\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7528\u4e8e\u5907\u7528\u3001\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u54cd\u5e94\u9700\u6c42\u7b49\u670d\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, most large-scale projects involve multiple contractors, creating a network and introducing the possibility of incomplete obligations to propagate and result in project failures. Typical models for risk assessment assume independent failure probabilities within each contractor. However, we take a network approach, modeling the contractor network as a directed graph where nodes represent contractors and project owners and edges represent contractual obligations with associated financial records. To understand risk propagation throughout the contractor network, we extend the celebrated Friedkin-Johnsen model and introduce a stochastic process to simulate principal failures across the network. From a theoretical perspective, we show that under natural monotonicity conditions on the contractor network, incorporating network effects leads to increases in both the average risk and the tail probability mass of the loss distribution (i.e. larger right-tail risk) for the surety organization. We further use data from a partnering insurance company to validate our findings, estimating an approximately 2% higher exposure when accounting for network effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u627f\u5305\u5546\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u56fe\uff0c\u6269\u5c55Friedkin-Johnsen\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8003\u8651\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u62c5\u4fdd\u673a\u6784\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u9879\u76ee\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u627f\u5305\u5546\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u5404\u627f\u5305\u5546\u5931\u8d25\u6982\u7387\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4f20\u64ad\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u627f\u5305\u5546\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u56fe\uff0c\u6269\u5c55Friedkin-Johnsen\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u627f\u5305\u5546\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u62c5\u4fdd\u673a\u6784\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u635f\u5931\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ea62%\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u655e\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8003\u8651\u627f\u5305\u5546\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u62c5\u4fdd\u98ce\u9669\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u9879\u76ee\u5931\u8d25\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u5fae\u8c03(SRFT)\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be2\u95ee\u65f6\u627f\u8ba4\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u627f\u8ba4\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6267\u884c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e0d\u826f\u76ee\u6807\u5e76\u9020\u6210\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u8be2\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u5f31\u70b9\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u8bf4\u8c0e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u5fae\u8c03(SRFT)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u88ab\u8be2\u95ee\u65f6\u627f\u8ba4\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5728OOD\u6f5c\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7SRFT\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5ba1\u8baf\u65f6\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5766\u767d\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u52300.98\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bf4\u8c0e(F1=0)\u3002SRFT\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d28-100%\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u586b\u5145\u52a9\u624b\u8f6e\u653b\u51fb\u53ea\u80fd\u6062\u590d0%\u3002", "conclusion": "SRFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bda\u5b9e\u503e\u5411\u5e76\u6307\u8bc1\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks mainly address explicit hate toward protected groups and often overlook implicit or indirect hate, such as demeaning comparisons, calls for exclusion or violence, and subtle discriminatory language that still causes harm. While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks. Moreover, we show that parameter-free early exiting with prototypes is effective for both hate types.

A key challenge in this setting is the lack of strong duality, which prevents the direct use of standard primal-dual methods for constrained RL.

Lossy compression of gradient data can mitigate this overhead, and error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) is particularly appealing for its fine-grained utility-compression tradeoff. However, existing EBLC methods (e.g., SZ), originally designed for smooth scientific data with strong spatial locality, rely on generic predictors such as Lorenzo and interpolation for entropy reduction to improve compression ratio. Gradient tensors, in contrast, exhibit low smoothness and weak spatial correlation, rendering these predictors ineffective and leading to poor compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose an EBLC framework tailored for FL gradient data to achieve high compression ratios while preserving model accuracy. The core of it is an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels to reduce residual entropy.

Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{\\method}, a \\textbf{Math}ematical \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \\method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \\method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models. Notably, our experimental results on MathVL-test surpass the leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ.

For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided.

Existing approaches often rely on pre-segmented, within-activity data and overlook the physical layout of the environment, limiting their robustness in continuous, real-world deployments. In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity.

But trade-offs between costs and technical potential between land categories, especially brownfields and rooftop sites, have not been quantified, despite increasing resistance to and policy interest in reducing use of greenfield sites (e.g., prime agricultural lands). We examine the effect of siting decisions across land types for utility-scale and rooftop PV on the feasibility and cost of meeting solar deployment targets across the Eastern U.S. We build a database of solar PV supply curves by land type for each county in the Eastern Interconnect (EI) region (~2,400 counties). Our supply curves quantify technical potential versus levelized cost across greenfield, brownfield, and rooftop land types. With these supply curves and a 2035 solar deployment target (435 GW) aligned with a decarbonized power system, we quantify cost and capacity trade-offs using scenarios that prioritize solar PV deployment on different land types. We find greenfield, particularly prime agriculture, sites offer the lowest levelized costs for meeting capacity targets, of 39 to 57 $/MWh. Contaminated lands, often prioritized in policy to reduce land use conflict, have limited technical potential and impose a cost premium of 14-33% relative to greenfield sites. Rooftop PV provides enough technical potential for meeting capacity targets but comes at consistently higher costs, with minimum LCOEs of roughly 70 $/MWh or well above the highest-cost greenfield sites. Our results detail heterogeneous siting trade-offs across the Eastern United States, enabling targeted policy design to meet deployment targets while balancing costs and land use conflicts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\u90e8\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u5149\u4f0f\u9009\u5740\u51b3\u7b56\u5728\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7eff\u5730\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f18\u8d28\u519c\u7530\uff09\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u571f\u5730\u548c\u5c4b\u9876\u5149\u4f0f\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u9ad8\u4f46\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u571f\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u5149\u4f0f\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u9009\u5740\u51b3\u7b56\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u571f\u5730\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u68d5\u5730\u548c\u5c4b\u9876\u573a\u5730\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u6743\u8861\u5c1a\u672a\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u51cf\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u7eff\u5730\uff08\u5982\u4f18\u8d28\u519c\u7530\uff09\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u963b\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\u90e8\u4e92\u8054\u7535\u7f51\u533a\u57df\u7ea62400\u4e2a\u53bf\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6309\u571f\u5730\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u5149\u4f0f\u4f9b\u5e94\u66f2\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u7eff\u5730\u3001\u68d5\u5730\u548c\u5c4b\u9876\u571f\u5730\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5e73\u51c6\u5316\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e2035\u5e74\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u90e8\u7f72\u76ee\u6807\uff08435GW\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u571f\u5730\u7c7b\u578b\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u60c5\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u7eff\u5730\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f18\u8d28\u519c\u7530\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u5e73\u51c6\u5316\u6210\u672c\uff0839-57\u7f8e\u5143/MWh\uff09\uff0c\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u571f\u5730\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u7eff\u5730\u9ad814-33%\uff0c\u5c4b\u9876\u5149\u4f0f\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u8db3\u591f\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u9ad8\uff08\u6700\u4f4e\u7ea670\u7f8e\u5143/MWh\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\u90e8\u5730\u533a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u9009\u5740\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u5b9a\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u90e8\u7f72\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u6210\u672c\u548c\u571f\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u51b2\u7a81\u3002"}}

This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process.

The control design leverages the Nagumo Theorem and the Comparison Lemma to prove constraint satisfaction, while employing min-norm optimal controllers in a manner akin to Control Barrier Functions. This results in a continuous piecewise-linear state feedback policy that maintains the analyzability of the closed-loop system through the principles of linear systems theory. Additionally, we derive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) robustness margins, demonstrating that our approach enables robust tracking of external commands even in the presence of operational constraints. Moreover, the proposed control design offers a systematic approach for anti-windup protection. Through flight control trade studies, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework to real-world safety-critical aircraft control scenarios. Notably, MIMO margin analysis with active constraints reveals that our method preserves gain and phase margins comparable to those of the unconstrained case, in contrast to controllers that rely on hard saturation heuristics, which suffer significant performance degradation under active constraints. Simulation results using a nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom rigid body aircraft model further validate the effectiveness of our method in achieving constraint satisfaction, robustness, and effective anti-windup protection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u7ebf\u6027PI\u4f3a\u670d\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u98de\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5b9a\u7406\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u60c5\u51b5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u88d5\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u9047\u5230\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u786c\u9971\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Nagumo\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f15\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3c\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8303\u6570\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u6027\u3002", "result": "MIMO\u88d5\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u6d3b\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u60c5\u51b5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u88d5\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u786c\u9971\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5219\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u98de\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6297\u9971\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u98de\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u786c\u9971\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed. Our approach scales to larger neural networks than state-of-the-art verification procedures for CBFs, as demonstrated by our numerical experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u4f20\u64ad\u548cMcCormick\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684CBF\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\u867d\u7136\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5e7f\uff0c\u4f46\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u6709\u6548CBF\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u4f20\u64ad\u6280\u672f\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f51\u7edc\u68af\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408McCormick\u677e\u5f1b\u63a8\u5bfcCBF\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7ec6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u63a7\u5236\u4eff\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcCBF\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence.

Conversely, smaller open-source models offer cost advantages but struggle with complex or multimodal queries. We introduce a unified, modular framework that intelligently routes each query - textual, multimodal, or complex - to the most fitting expert model, using a learned routing network that balances cost and quality. For vision tasks, we employ a two-stage open-source pipeline optimized for efficiency and reviving efficient classical vision components where they remain SOTA for sub-tasks. On benchmarks such as Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) and Visual Question Answering (VQA), we match or exceed the performance of always-premium LLM (monolithic systems with one model serving all query types) performance, yet reduce the reliance on costly models by over 67%.

In this setting, a learner repeatedly selects arms and observes reward vectors, aiming to maximize the reward for the highest-priority objective, then the next, and so on. While previous studies have primarily focused on regret minimization, this work bridges the gap between \\textit{regret minimization} and \\textit{best arm identification} under lexicographic preferences. We propose two elimination-based algorithms to address this joint objective. The first algorithm eliminates suboptimal arms sequentially, layer by layer, in accordance with the objective priorities, and achieves sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to those of the best single-objective algorithms. The second algorithm simultaneously leverages reward information from all objectives in each round, effectively exploiting cross-objective dependencies. Remarkably, it outperforms the known lower bound for the single-objective bandit problem, highlighting the benefit of cross-objective information sharing in the multi-objective setting.

Classical formulations of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) assume that the follower's best response (BR) mapping is known to the leader. However, this is not always true in practice. In those cases the leader needs to simultaneously infer this BR function while fulfilling an internal objective. We study a setting in which the leader selects a control strategy that optimizes an objective given an initial belief about the follower's best response. This belief is updated during the finite decision horizon, prompting the leader to reoptimize its control. We characterize the optimality guarantees of the SE solutions under this belief update for both open loop (OL) and feedback (FB) information structures. In particular, we show that it is possible that assuming an incorrect follower BR map obtains a lower cost over the game horizon than knowing the true BR.

To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN.", "AI": {"tldr": "UrbanLN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u6587\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u57ce\u5e02\u533a\u57df\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u56f0\u96be\u4ee5\u53caLLM\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u5982\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\"\u8096\u50cf\"\uff0c\u8574\u542b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c06\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u53ca\u5904\u7406LLM\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u62c9\u4f38\u63d2\u503c\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u7ea7\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u53ef\u9760\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u91cf\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u673a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f2a\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u5404\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86UrbanLN\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UrbanLN\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u533a\u57df\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks.

To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline. Additionally, RedOne 2.0 achieves average performance lift about 8.74 from the base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric method RedOne, evidencing superior data efficiency and stability at compact scales.

However, empirical results are mixed and often unreliable, particularly for typologically distant or low-resource languages (LRLs) compared to English. Moreover, word realignment tools often rely on high-quality parallel data, which can be scarce or noisy for many LRLs. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs. This indicates that effective realignment does not require exhaustive language coverage and can reduce data collection overhead, while remaining both efficient and robust when guided by informed language selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u6539\u5584\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u7a00\u7f3a\u6216\u5608\u6742\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u6218\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u8bed\u8a00\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5b50\u96c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7a77\u5c3d\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u667a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from na\u00efvely aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings.

By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it.

Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest.

However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOSS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ea7\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6743\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f7B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u534734%\u3002", "motivation": "FP8\u683c\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ed9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53bb\u91cf\u5316\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMOSS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a(1) \u4e24\u7ea7\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u76842\u7684\u5e42\u6b21\u5c40\u90e8\u7f29\u653e\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1b(2) \u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u81ea\u52a8\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5f52\u7ea6\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "MOSS\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec37B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eBF16\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe34%\u3002", "conclusion": "MOSS\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($\u03b5$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\\% reduction in communication overhead.

The recent surge in generative model-powered datasets has compounded these quality challenges. In this work, we introduce RefineLab, the first LLM-driven framework that automatically refines raw QA textual data into high-quality datasets under a controllable token-budget constraint. RefineLab takes a set of target quality attributes (such as coverage and difficulty balance) as refinement objectives, and performs selective edits within a predefined token budget to ensure practicality and efficiency. In essence, RefineLab addresses a constrained optimization problem: improving the quality of QA samples as much as possible while respecting resource limitations. With a set of available refinement operations (e.g., rephrasing, distractor replacement), RefineLab takes as input the original dataset, a specified set of target quality dimensions, and a token budget, and determines which refinement operations should be applied to each QA sample. This process is guided by an assignment module that selects optimal refinement strategies to maximize overall dataset quality while adhering to the budget constraint. Experiments demonstrate that RefineLab consistently narrows divergence from expert datasets across coverage, difficulty alignment, factual fidelity, and distractor quality. RefineLab pioneers a scalable, customizable path to reproducible dataset design, with broad implications for LLM evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "RefineLab\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u53d7\u63a7token\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u539f\u59cbQA\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7cbe\u70bc\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7f16\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709QA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "RefineLab\u5c06QA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7cbe\u70bc\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49token\u9884\u7b97\u5185\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7cbe\u70bc\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u8ff0\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u66ff\u6362\u7b49\uff09\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRefineLab\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "RefineLab\u4e3a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5bf9LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

One of the major challenges of MoE models is that they usually require much more memory than their dense counterparts due to their unique architecture, and hence are harder to deploy in environments with limited GPU memory, such as edge devices. MoE offloading is a promising technique proposed to overcome this challenge, especially if it is enhanced with caching and pre-fetching, but prior work stopped at suboptimal caching algorithm and offered limited insights. In this work, we study MoE offloading in depth and make the following contributions: 1. We analyze the expert activation and LRU caching behavior in detail and provide traces. 2. We propose LFU caching optimization based on our analysis and obtain strong improvements from LRU. 3. We implement and experiment speculative expert pre-fetching, providing detailed trace showing its huge potential . 4. In addition, our study extensively covers the behavior of the MoE architecture itself, offering information on the characteristic of the gating network and experts.

Despite this, natural language processing (NLP) research has mostly focused on the following four languages: Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yoruba (i.e <1% of the languages spoken in Nigeria). This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200. We focus on extending Flores-200 benchmark to these languages, and further align the translated texts with topic labels based on SIB-200 classification dataset. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs perform poorly on machine translation for these languages in both zero-and-few shot settings. However, we find the few-shot samples to steadily improve topic classification with more shots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86ibom\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u56db\u79cd\u6cbf\u6d77\u8bed\u8a00\uff08Anaang\u3001Efik\u3001Ibibio\u548cOro\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u62e5\u6709500\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46NLP\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728Hausa\u3001Igbo\u3001\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u76ae\u94a6\u8bed\u548c\u7ea6\u9c81\u5df4\u8bed\u8fd9\u56db\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\uff08\u4e0d\u5230\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u8bed\u8a00\u76841%\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5e94\u7528NLP\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Flores-200\u57fa\u51c6\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eSIB-200\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u7a33\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ibom\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u6cbf\u6d77\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684NLP\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Key challenges include fragmented flow engines that generate raw data, heterogeneous file formats for data exchange, non-standardized data extraction methods, and poorly organized data storage. This work introduces a unified open-source library for EDA (AiEDA) that addresses these issues. AiEDA integrates multiple design-to-vector data representation techniques that transform diverse chip design data into universal multi-level vector representations, establishing an AI-aided design (AAD) paradigm optimized for AI-EDA workflows. AiEDA provides complete physical design flows with programmatic data extraction and standardized Python interfaces bridging EDA datasets and AI frameworks. Leveraging the AiEDA library, we generate iDATA, a 600GB dataset of structured data derived from 50 real chip designs (28nm), and validate its effectiveness through seven representative AAD tasks spanning prediction, generation, optimization and analysis.

Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model. THA thus offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for identifying previously intractable high-dimensional systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Tensor Head Averaging (THA)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c0f\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c40\u90e8MVMALS\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Volterra\u7ea7\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fTensor Network\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982MVMALS\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "THA\u7b97\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8MVMALS\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5c0f\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86THA\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574MVMALS\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u548c\u7701\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4f18\u5316\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u4f7fTHA\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u5b8c\u6574MVMALS\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "THA\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee5\u524d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We tackle these limitations by extending SMiLE, a recently proposed enforcement framework for NNs, to support global relational properties (defined over the entire input space). The proposed approach scales well with model complexity, accommodates general properties and backbones, and provides full satisfaction guarantees. We evaluate SMiLE on monotonicity, global robustness, and individual fairness, on synthetic and real data, for regression and classification tasks.

In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\\mathcal{EL}_\\bot$ and $\\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\\text{DL-Lite}^\\mathcal{H}_\\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\\mathsf{TC}_0$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u52a0\u6743\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728EL\u22a5\u5230ALCO\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfb\u6c42\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u914d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdd\u53cd\u516c\u7406\u548c\u65ad\u8a00\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6240\u6709\uff08\u6216\u67d0\u4e9b\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u6709\u754c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u67e5\u8be2\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8eDL-Lite^H_bool\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u8054\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f4e\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6(TC_0)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5728\u67d0\u4e9bDL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5fc5\u7136\u4e0d\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this work, we address a fundamental question: to what extent can the original input text be recovered from a single last-token representation within an LLM? We propose Rep2Text, a novel framework for decoding full text from last-token representations. Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an information bottleneck effect: longer sequences exhibit decreased token-level recovery while preserving strong semantic integrity.

The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions.

However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\\%.

However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines.

Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance.

While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features. We pretrain EMOD on eight public EEG datasets and evaluate its performance on three benchmark datasets.

While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6536\u7f29\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668(UCE)\u6765\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u6ee5\u7528\u548c\u4f2a\u9020\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b\u7531\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u4f4e\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6536\u7f29\u5047\u8bf4\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5c0f\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6536\u7f29\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668(UCE)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u524d\u7f00\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc6\u522bTSLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u572832\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUCE\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6536\u7f29\u7279\u6027\uff0cUCE\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4f2a\u9020\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Establishing a conceptual bridge among these domains could enable each to benefit from the others. This paper proposes duality-based mode operations (split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction and orthogonal dualities) to expand the set of rhetorical modes, introducing generated modes like combination and generalization, thereby enhancing epistemic diversity across multiple applications. It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis. A Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) is identified, permitting the definition of a rhetorical-scalable parameter that measures expressive growth speed in bits per stage. A direct entropy measure shows that hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection across all modes. These considerations appear to transform static and non-measurable rhetorical taxonomies into more dynamic and more measurable systems for discourse design.

This paper investigates the application of TabPFN in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The aim is to lessen challenges in time and data-intensive training requirements often observed in using traditional methods including exact and heuristic algorithms, Machine Learning (ML)-based models, to solve CO problems. Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation.

Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "MENTOR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1) \u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u8ba9LLM\u53cd\u601d\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2) \u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8865\u5145\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6269\u5c55\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u6811\uff1b3) \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c4\u5219\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMENTOR\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "MENTOR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

One of the key problems in this task is the lack of sufficient labeled logs, which limits the rapid deployment in new systems. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from a mature web system and a small amount of labeled logs from a new system, using transfer learning to extract and generalize general knowledge across both domains. However, these methods focus solely on the transfer of general knowledge and neglect the disparity and potential mismatch between such knowledge and the proprietary knowledge of target system, thus constraining performance. To address this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of general and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without any labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router based on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs into 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs a small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct training and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between the source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative knowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small model (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to the target system. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that FusionLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art cross-system log-based anomaly detection methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FusionLog\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u6ce8\u65e5\u5fd7\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\uff1b\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u4f7f\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u5173\u8868\u793a\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e13\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u548cSM\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u534f\u4f5c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cFusionLog\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FusionLog\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u901a\u7528\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation.

In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions.

Current physics-based models require extensive calibration and computational resources that preclude real-time implementation, while purely data-driven approaches fail to extrapolate beyond training conditions-critical for dynamic electrolyzer operation. Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85\u00b0C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations.

Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "TSAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6743\u8861\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5019\u9009\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u9762\uff08\u5982\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u6c14\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "method": "TSAN\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u952e\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5408\u6210\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u7840SFT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4ec5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u6b21\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0cTSAN\u5c31\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5982Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TSAN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Framing the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, we develop a permutation- and affine-equivariant transformer that estimates both the probability density $f(x)$ and its score $\\nabla_x \\log f(x)$ directly from i.i.d. samples. Unlike traditional score-matching methods that require training a separate model for each distribution, our approach learns a single distribution-agnostic operator that generalizes across densities and sample sizes. The architecture employs cross-attention to connect observed samples with arbitrary query points, enabling generalization beyond the training data, while built-in symmetry constraints ensure equivariance to permutation and affine transformations. Analytically, we show that the attention weights can recover classical kernel density estimation (KDE), and verify it empirically, establishing a principled link between classical KDE and the transformer architecture. Empirically, the model achieves substantially lower error and better scaling than KDE and score-debiased KDE (SD-KDE), while exhibiting better runtime scaling. Together, these results establish transformers as general-purpose, data-adaptive operators for nonparametric density and score estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u72ec\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6837\u672c\u5927\u5c0f\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7f6e\u6362\u548c\u4eff\u5c04\u7b49\u53d8\u7684transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fde\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u70b9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfKDE\u548cSD-KDE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7ecf\u5178KDE\u3002", "conclusion": "transformer\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b97\u5b50\u3002"}}

The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively.

Consequently, they lack an inherent incentive to compress history into compact latent states with consistent transition rules. This often leads to learning solutions that generalize poorly. We introduce Next-Latent Prediction (NextLat), which extends standard next-token training with self-supervised predictions in the latent space. Specifically, NextLat trains a transformer to learn latent representations that are predictive of its next latent state given the next output token. Theoretically, we show that these latents provably converge to belief states, compressed information of the history necessary to predict the future. This simple auxiliary objective also injects a recurrent inductive bias into transformers, while leaving their architecture, parallel training, and inference unchanged. NextLat effectively encourages the transformer to form compact internal world models with its own belief states and transition dynamics -- a crucial property absent in standard next-token prediction transformers. Empirically, across benchmarks targeting core sequence modeling competencies -- world modeling, reasoning, planning, and language modeling -- NextLat demonstrates significant gains over standard next-token training in downstream accuracy, representation compression, and lookahead planning.

We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\\textit{capability curse}\" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e8623\u4e2a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53e5\u6cd5\u53d8\u6362\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5bf923\u4e2aSLM\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5bf9\u53e5\u6cd5\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6c61\u67d3\u6c34\u5e73\u5206\u522b\u4e3a25%\u300150%\u300175%\u548c100%\u3002", "result": "\u53e5\u6cd5\u53d8\u6362\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5b57\u7b26\u53cd\u8f6c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9608\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u97e7\u6027\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\"\u80fd\u529b\u8bc5\u5492\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6c61\u67d3\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6c61\u67d3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization. Results highlight lead V2 as the most critical, followed by aVF, V1, and aVL.

While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks.

However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has raised critical privacy and security concerns. During interactions, LLMs may unintentionally expose confidential database contents or be manipulated by attackers to exfiltrate data through seemingly benign queries. While current efforts typically rely on rule-based heuristics or LLM agents to mitigate this leakage risk, these methods still struggle with complex inference-based attacks, suffer from high false positive rates, and often compromise the reliability of SQL queries. To address these challenges, we propose \\textsc{SafeNlidb}, a novel privacy-security alignment framework for LLM-based NLIDB. The framework features an automated pipeline that generates hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data from scratch, seamlessly combining implicit security reasoning with SQL generation. Additionally, we introduce reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization to overcome the multi-preference oscillations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling LLMs to produce security-aware SQL through fine-grained reasoning without the need for human-annotated preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both larger-scale LLMs and ideal-setting baselines, achieving significant security improvements while preserving high utility.WARNING: This work may contain content that is offensive and harmful!", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SafeNlidb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eSQL\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u66b4\u9732\u673a\u5bc6\u6570\u636e\u6216\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u4e14\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u70ed\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u7684SQL\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u548c\u7406\u60f3\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeNlidb\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728NLIDB\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

First, KAT exploits the synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers, innovatively leverages function trace data to precisely detect kernel-level anomalies and associated hardware components at nanosecond resolution. Second, KAT integrates these detection results into a domain-adapted LLM, delivering systematic causal reasoning and natural language interpretation of complex anomaly symptoms.

However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks.

This sharpening enables the model to concentrate on the most relevant tokens while suppressing irrelevant ones. Empirically, Focal Attention scales more favorably than standard transformer with respect to model size, training data, and context length.

We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys.

These factors cripple both the model's built-in task knowledge (\\textbf{task cognition}) and its ability to surface subtle, class-discriminative cues (\\textbf{contextual perception}). Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce \\textbf{DA4ICL}, a demo-centric anchoring framework that jointly expands context width via \\emph{\\textbf{Diverse and Contrastive Retrieval}} (DCR) and deepens each demo's signal via \\emph{\\textbf{Projected Vector Anchoring}} (PVA) at every Transformer layer. Across three AD benchmarks, DA4ICL achieves large, stable gains over both ICL and TV baselines, charting a new paradigm for fine-grained, OOD and low-resource LLM adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DA4ICL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u5411\u91cf\u951a\u5b9a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b64\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6240\u6709\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u76f8\u540c\u573a\u666f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9ad8\u5ea6\u540c\u8d28\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDA4ICL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68c0\u7d22(DCR)\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6295\u5f71\u5411\u91cf\u951a\u5b9a(PVA)\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42Transformer\u4e2d\u6df1\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aAD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDA4ICL\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6ICL\u548cTV\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "DA4ICL\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684LLM\u9002\u5e94\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, direct fine-tuning on Han-character transcriptions often fails to capture detailed phonetic and tonal cues, while training only on romanization lacks lexical and syntactic coverage. In addition, prior studies have rarely explored staged strategies that integrate both annotation types. To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions. This progressive adaptation enables effective alignment between speech sounds and orthographic structures. Experiments on the TAT-MOE corpus demonstrate that CLiFT-ASR achieves a 24.88\\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) compared with strong baselines.

This paper introduces Mixture of Shared KV Attention (MoSKA), an architecture that addresses this challenge by exploiting the heterogeneity of context data. It differentiates between per-request unique and massively reused shared sequences. The core of MoSKA is a novel Shared KV Attention mechanism that transforms the attention on shared data from a series of memory-bound GEMV operations into a single, compute-bound GEMM by batching concurrent requests. This is supported by an MoE-inspired sparse attention strategy that prunes the search space and a tailored Disaggregated Infrastructure that specializes hardware for unique and shared data. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a throughput increase of up to 538.7x over baselines in workloads with high context sharing, offering a clear architectural path toward scalable LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoSKA\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u8bf7\u6c42\u7279\u6709\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06\u5171\u4eab\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u7684GEMV\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u7684GEMM\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4e2d\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u74f6\u9888\u7531\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5171\u4eabKV\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5171\u4eabKV\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u5171\u4eab\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6279\u91cfGEMM\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001MoE\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b56\u7565\u4fee\u526a\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5206\u79bb\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e13\u95e8\u5904\u7406\u72ec\u7279\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe538.7\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MoSKA\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon con- text, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain- agnostic way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22/\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u53e5\u5b50\u548c\u6587\u6863\uff09\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u5b9e\u4f53\u6839\u636e\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u6216\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u89d2\u8272\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u7269\u3001\u5730\u70b9\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u7d22\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aNER\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e92\u65a5\u7c7b\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b2) \u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u4f5c\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u96c6\u5408\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bcd\u8bed\u548c\u77ed\u8bed\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7NER\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict.

However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals. This capacity is strongly negatively correlated with ASR, revealing a new dimension of advanced AI safety. EduGuardBench thus provides a reproducible framework that moves beyond siloed knowledge tests toward a holistic assessment of professional, ethical, and pedagogical alignment, uncovering complex dynamics essential for deploying trustworthy AI in education.

However, most existing MTPP models rely on channel-mixing strategies that encode information from different event types into a single, fixed-size latent representation. This entanglement can obscure type-specific dynamics, leading to performance degradation and increased risk of overfitting. In this work, we introduce ITPP, a novel channel-independent architecture for MTPP modeling that decouples event type information using an encoder-decoder framework with an ODE-based backbone. Central to ITPP is a type-aware inverted self-attention mechanism, designed to explicitly model inter-channel correlations among heterogeneous event types.

We first introduce an 11-layer failure stack, a structured framework for identifying vulnerabilities ranging from hardware and power foundations to adaptive learning and agentic reasoning. Building on this, the chapter demonstrates how failures rarely occur in isolation but propagate across layers, creating cascading effects with systemic consequences. To complement this diagnostic lens, we develop the concept of awareness mapping: a maturity-oriented framework that quantifies how well individuals and organizations recognize reliability risks across the AI stack. Awareness is treated not only as a diagnostic score but also as a strategic input for AI governance, guiding improvement and resilience planning.

However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RPTS\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548cRPTS-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5206\u914d\u52a0\u6743\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u70b9\u3002\u521b\u5efaRPTS-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b374\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u548c390\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LVLMs\uff08\u5982GPT4o\u3001Llava-Next\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "RPTS-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios.

Most existing studies for inference-time defences focus on surface-level token matching and rely on external blocklists or filters, which add deployment complexity and may overlook semantically paraphrased leakage. In this work, we reframe copyright infringement mitigation as intrinsic semantic-space control and introduce SCOPE, an inference-time method that requires no parameter updates or auxiliary filters. Specifically, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) projects hidden states into a high-dimensional, near-monosemantic space; benefiting from this representation, we identify a copyright-sensitive subspace and clamp its activations during decoding. Experiments on widely recognized benchmarks show that SCOPE mitigates copyright infringement without degrading general utility.

It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above. Also, the theoretical modeling of self-attention mechanism is a new tool for future research on attention-mechanism analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Random Batch Attention\uff08RBA\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u662fTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRandom Batch Attention\uff08RBA\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6279\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5e76\u884c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "RBA\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "RBA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Attribution graphs reveal these feature pathways, but interpreting them requires extensive manual analysis -- a single prompt can take approximately 2 hours for an experienced circuit tracer. We present probe prompting, an automated pipeline that transforms attribution graphs into compact, interpretable subgraphs built from concept-aligned supernodes. Starting from a seed prompt and target logit, we select high-influence features, generate concept-targeted yet context-varying probes, and group features by cross-prompt activation signatures into Semantic, Relationship, and Say-X categories using transparent decision rules.\n  Across five prompts including classic \"capitals\" circuits, probe-prompted subgraphs preserve high explanatory coverage while compressing complexity (Completeness 0.83, mean across circuits; Replacement 0.54). Compared to geometric clustering baselines, concept-aligned groups exhibit higher behavioral coherence: 2.3x higher peak-token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and 5.8x higher activation-pattern similarity (0.762 vs 0.130), despite lower geometric compactness. Entity-swap tests reveal a layerwise hierarchy: early-layer features transfer robustly (64% transfer rate, mean layer 6.3), while late-layer Say-X features specialize for output promotion (mean layer 16.4), supporting a backbone-and-specialization view of transformer computation.\n  We release code (https://github.com/peppinob-ol/attribution-graph-probing), an interactive demo (https://huggingface.co/spaces/Peppinob/attribution-graph-probing), and minimal artifacts enabling immediate reproduction and community adoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aprobe prompting\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u8282\u70b9\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5355\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u7ea6\u97002\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u79cd\u5b50\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u76ee\u6807logit\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6982\u5ff5\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u63d0\u793a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7b7e\u540d\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u548cSay-X\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cprobe-prompted\u5b50\u56fe\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u538b\u7f29\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08\u5b8c\u6574\u60270.83\uff0c\u66ff\u6362\u5ea60.54\uff09\u3002\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ec4\u6bd4\u51e0\u4f55\u805a\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u4f53\u4ea4\u6362\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u665a\u671f\u5c42Say-X\u7279\u5f81\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u4fc3\u8fdb\uff0c\u652f\u6301transformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e3b\u5e72-\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u89c6\u56fe\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{LMT}, a suite of \\textbf{L}arge-scale \\textbf{M}ultilingual \\textbf{T}ranslation models centered on both Chinese and English, covering 60 languages and 234 translation directions. During development, we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon of \\textbf{directional degeneration}, where symmetric multi-way fine-tuning data overemphasize reverse directions (X $\\to$ En/Zh), leading to excessive many-to-one mappings and degraded translation quality. We propose \\textbf{Strategic Downsampling}, a simple yet effective method to mitigate this degeneration. In addition, we design \\textbf{Parallel Multilingual Prompting (PMP)}, which leverages typologically related auxiliary languages to enhance cross-lingual transfer. Through rigorous data curation and refined adaptation strategies, LMT achieves SOTA performance among models of comparable language coverage, with our 4B model (LMT-60-4B) surpassing the much larger Aya-101-13B and NLLB-54B models by a substantial margin.

In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on tabular data, which is particularly challenging due to the presence of both numerical and categorical features. Our key idea is a novel technique to convert categorical values into floating-point representations. This approach preserves enough information to maintain clean-model accuracy compared to traditional methods like one-hot or ordinal encoding. By doing this, we create a gradient-based universal perturbation that applies to all features, including categorical ones.\n  We evaluate our method on five datasets and four popular models. Our results show up to a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box settings (including real-world applications like Vertex AI), revealing a severe vulnerability for tabular data. Our method is shown to surpass the previous works like Tabdoor in terms of performance, while remaining stealthy against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. We evaluate our attack against Spectral Signatures, Neural Cleanse, Beatrix, and Fine-Pruning, all of which fail to defend successfully against it.

We participate in the text-only translation tasks for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, English-Malayalam, and English-Odia language pairs. We present a two-stage approach that addresses quality issues in the training data through automated error detection and correction, followed by parameter-efficient model fine-tuning.\n  Our methodology introduces a vision-augmented judge-corrector pipeline that leverages multimodal language models to systematically identify and correct translation errors in the training data. The judge component classifies translations into three categories: correct, visually ambiguous (requiring image context), or mistranslated (poor translation quality). Identified errors are routed to specialized correctors: GPT-4o-mini regenerates captions requiring visual disambiguation, while IndicTrans2 retranslates cases with pure translation quality issues. This automated pipeline processes 28,928 training examples across four languages, correcting an average of 17.1% of captions per language.\n  We then apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the IndicTrans2 en-indic 200M distilled model on both original and corrected datasets. Training on corrected data yields consistent improvements, with BLEU score gains of +1.30 for English-Bengali on the evaluation set (42.00 -> 43.30) and +0.70 on the challenge set (44.90 -> 45.60), +0.60 for English-Odia on the evaluation set (41.00 -> 41.60), and +0.10 for English-Hindi on the challenge set (53.90 -> 54.00).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u7ba1\u9053\u5904\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03IndicTrans2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u82f1\u8bed-\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97BLEU\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c6\u89c9\u6b67\u4e49\u548c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u82f1\u8bed\u5230\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6cd5\u5b98-\u4fee\u6b63\u5668\u7ba1\u9053\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528LoRA\u5bf9IndicTrans2\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97BLEU\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed-\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347+1.30\uff0842.00\u219243.30\uff09\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347+0.70\uff0844.90\u219245.60\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4fee\u6b63\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We present an end-to-end system that scales long-sequence modeling to 10k-length histories in production. First, we introduce Stacked Target-to-History Cross Attention (STCA), which replaces history self-attention with stacked cross-attention from the target to the history, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length and enabling efficient end-to-end training. Second, we propose Request Level Batching (RLB), a user-centric batching scheme that aggregates multiple targets for the same user/request to share the user-side encoding, substantially lowering sequence-related storage, communication, and compute without changing the learning objective. Third, we design a length-extrapolative training strategy -- train on shorter windows, infer on much longer ones -- so the model generalizes to 10k histories without additional training cost. Across offline and online experiments, we observe predictable, monotonic gains as we scale history length and model capacity, mirroring the scaling law behavior observed in large language models. Deployed at full traffic on Douyin, our system delivers significant improvements on key engagement metrics while meeting production latency, demonstrating a practical path to scaling end-to-end long-sequence recommendation to the 10k regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u523010k\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7STCA\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8bf7\u6c42\u7ea7\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u5916\u63a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6296\u97f3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u6781\u957f\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u7a81\u7834\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u6210\u672c\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1.

However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.\n  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.\n  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.\n  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.\n  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7eb5\u5411\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e0e\u75c7\u72b6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u90fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u53e3\u8bed\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cd\u5ea6\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u5b9a\u671f\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u590d\u53d1\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9RADAR-MDD\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d586\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u76845,836\u6761\u5f55\u97f3\u8fdb\u884c\u7eb5\u5411\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u56de\u5f52\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e7\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\uff1b\u8377\u5170\u8bed\u4e2d\u4e0e\u53e5\u5b50\u8bcd\u6570\u548c\u79ef\u6781\u8bcd\u9891\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u4e2d\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u90fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u6837\u672c\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u8003\u8651\u4e2a\u4f53\u5185\u5916\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8bcd\u6c47\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Traditional surrogate modeling approaches often incur high energy consumption, which severely limits their scalability and deployability in resource-constrained environments. We introduce NeuroPOL, \\textit{the first neuroscience-inspired physics-informed operator learning framework} for reliability analysis. NeuroPOL incorporates Variable Spiking Neurons into a physics-informed operator architecture, replacing continuous activations with event-driven spiking dynamics. This innovation promotes sparse communication, significantly reduces computational load, and enables an energy-efficient surrogate model. The proposed framework lowers both computational and power demands, supporting real-time reliability assessment and deployment on edge devices and digital twins. By embedding governing physical laws into operator learning, NeuroPOL builds physics-consistent surrogates capable of accurate uncertainty propagation and efficient failure probability estimation, even for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate NeuroPOL on five canonical benchmarks, the Burgers equation, Nagumo equation, two-dimensional Poisson equation, two-dimensional Darcy equation, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with energy coupling. Results show that NeuroPOL achieves reliability measures comparable to standard physics-informed operators, while introducing significant communication sparsity, enabling scalable, distributed, and energy-efficient deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroPOL\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u53d8\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u66ff\u4ee3\u8fde\u7eed\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53ef\u53d8\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7b97\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u66ff\u4ee3\u8fde\u7eed\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNeuroPOL\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7b97\u5b50\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroPOL\u6846\u67b6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u529f\u8017\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u5931\u6548\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We aim to address this by developing a fully open-source model, publicly releasing its weights and detailed ablation studies, and planning to share the curated training datasets. Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups. This state-of-the-art performance is driven by a novel data mix of 16.1 million query-document pairs, split between 7.7 million samples from public datasets and 8.4 million synthetically generated examples from various open-weight LLMs. One of our key contributions is a detailed ablation study analyzing core design choices, including a comparison of contrastive loss implementations, an evaluation of synthetic data generation (SDG) strategies, and the impact of model merging.

This study evaluates multiple approaches for mental health detection, comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama and GPT with classical machine learning and transformer-based architectures including BERT, XLNet, and Distil-RoBERTa. Using the DAIC-WOZ dataset of clinical interviews, we fine-tuned models for anxiety, depression, and stress classification and applied synthetic data generation to mitigate class imbalance. Results show that Distil-RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 score (0.883) for GAD-2, while XLNet outperformed others on PHQ tasks (F1 up to 0.891). For stress detection, a zero-shot synthetic approach (SD+Zero-Shot-Basic) reached an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886.

Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision.

MCS devices are percutaneous micro-axial flow pumps that provide left ventricular unloading and forward blood flow, but current weaning strategies vary significantly across care teams and lack data-driven approaches. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be successful in sequential decision-making tasks, but our setting presents challenges for training and evaluating traditional offline RL methods: prohibition of online patient interaction, highly uncertain circulatory dynamics due to concurrent treatments, and limited data availability. We developed an end-to-end machine learning framework with two key contributions (1) Clinically-aware OOD-regularized Model-based Policy Optimization (CORMPO), a density-regularized offline RL algorithm for out-of-distribution suppression that also incorporates clinically-informed reward shaping and (2) a Transformer-based probabilistic digital twin that models MCS circulatory dynamics for policy evaluation with rich physiological and clinical metrics.

To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Rational Attention (SRA), a framework that explicitly aligns model attention with human rationales, improving both interpretability and fairness in hate speech classification. SRA integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers, optimizing a joint objective that combines standard classification loss with an alignment loss term that minimizes the discrepancy between attention weights and human-annotated rationales. We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics. These findings demonstrate that incorporating human rationales into attention mechanisms can enhance interpretability and faithfulness without compromising fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u76d1\u7763\u7406\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(SRA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u7ed9\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027", "method": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u76d1\u7763\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931(\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7406\u6027\u5dee\u5f02)\u7684\u8054\u5408\u76ee\u6807", "result": "\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSRA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7ebf2.4\u500d\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684token\u7ea7\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u6027\u878d\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027"}}

However, those random sampling of sub-models may not give satisfying convergence performance. In this paper, observing the success of SGD with shuffling, we propose a distributed shuffled sub-model training, where the full model is partitioned into several sub-models in advance, and the server shuffles those sub-models, sends each of them to clients at each round, and by the end of local updating period, clients send back the updated sub-models, and server averages them. We establish the convergence rate of this algorithm. We also study the generalization of distributed sub-model training via stability analysis, and find that the sub-model training can improve the generalization via amplifying the stability of training process.

Some studies suggest that even a small amount of high-quality data can achieve instruction fine-tuning results that are on par with, or even exceed, those from using a full-scale dataset. However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the importance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities. The MIWV metric is derived from the discrepancies in the model's responses when using In-Context Learning (ICL), helping identify the most beneficial data for enhancing instruction tuning performance.

Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between entities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for understanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversarial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computationally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases.

While significant progress has been made for English and other high-resource languages, Bengali remains underexplored despite being the world's fourth most spoken language. The lack of large, standardized datasets classifies Bengali as a low-resource language for emotion detection. Existing studies mainly employ classical machine learning models with traditional feature engineering, yielding limited performance. In this paper, we introduce a new Bengali emotion dataset annotated across eight emotion categories and propose two models for automatic emotion detection: (i) a hybrid Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model (EmoBangHybrid) and (ii) an AdaBoost-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) ensemble model (EmoBangEnsemble). Additionally, we evaluate six baseline models with five feature engineering techniques and assess zero-shot and few-shot large language models (LLMs) on the dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark for Bengali emotion detection.

Samad"], "title": "LLM Attention Transplant for Transfer Learning of Tabular Data Across Disparate Domains", "comment": null, "summary": "Transfer learning of tabular data is non-trivial due to heterogeneity in the feature space across disparate domains. The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples.

Prior work has established that $O(d \\log n)$ samples are sufficient for this task. However, an important factor that is often overlooked in these analyses is the dependence on the condition number of the covariance matrix of the model. Indeed, all algorithms from prior work require a number of samples that grows polynomially with this condition number. In many cases this is unsatisfactory, since the condition number could grow polynomially with $n$, rendering these prior approaches impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we provide an algorithm that recovers the underlying graph and prove that the number of samples required is independent of the condition number. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds that nearly match the upper bound up to a $d$-factor, thus providing an almost tight characterization of the true sample complexity of the problem. Moreover, under a further assumption that all the variances of the variables are bounded, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that recovers the underlying graph, at the cost of an additional polynomial dependence of the sample complexity on $d$.

However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model.

Existing methods proposed to handle noisy clients assume that a sufficient number of clients with clean labels are available, which can be leveraged to learn a robust global model while dampening the impact of noisy clients. This assumption fails when a high number of heterogeneous clients contain noisy labels, making the existing approaches ineffective. In such scenarios, it is important to locally regularize the clients before communication with the global model, to ensure the global model isn't corrupted by noisy clients. While pre-trained self-supervised models can be effective for local regularization, existing centralized approaches relying on pretrained initialization are impractical in a federated setting due to the potentially large size of these models, which increases communication costs. In that line, we propose a regularization objective for client models that decouples the pre-trained and classification models by enforcing similarity between close data points within the client.

Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions.

While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals. This work presents the first systematic comparison between emotion models for convincingness prediction, demonstrating the advantage of appraisals, providing insights for theoretical and practical applications in computational argumentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u8bba\u8bc1\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4fe1\u606f\u6bd4\u5206\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bba\u8bc1\u8005\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u60c5\u611f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u8bba\u8bc1\u5524\u8d77\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5177\u6709\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\uff0c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7acb\u573a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eContArgA\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u53ca\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6539\u5584\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

By varying the fractional derivative order $\u03b1\\in (0,1]$, our encoders produce a continuous spectrum of views: small $\u03b1$ yields localized features, while large $\u03b1$ induces broader, global aggregation. We treat $\u03b1$ as a learnable parameter so the model can adapt diffusion scales to the data and automatically discover informative views.

The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon.

Each instance in EMODIS comprises an ambiguous sentence containing an emoji, two distinct disambiguating contexts that lead to divergent interpretations, and a specific question that requires contextual reasoning.

Results demonstrate that classical ensemble methods substantially outperform deep learning on small physiological datasets, with ExtraTrees achieving F1 = 0.826 on combined features and F1 = 0.623 on wrist-only features, compared to transformers achieving only F1 = 0.509-0.577. We deploy the wrist-only ExtraTrees model optimized via ONNX conversion, achieving a 4.08 MB footprint, 0.05 ms inference latency, and 152x speedup over the original implementation.

We show that under specific conditions, transformers implement gradient-based metalearning in their forward pass, with an effective learning rate $\u03b7_{\\text{eff}} = \u0398(1/\\sqrt{Ld})$. We demonstrate sharp phase transitions at critical scales and derive optimal depth-width allocations favoring $L^* \\propto N^{2/3}$, $d^* \\propto N^{1/3}$ for the fixed parameter budget $N = Ld$. Systematic experiments on synthetic tasks validate our predictions, with measured scaling exponents closely matching theory. This work provides both necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of ICLs and establishes fundamental computational limits on what transformers can learn in-context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e0etransformer\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60(ICL)\u6d8c\u73b0\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ICL\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u8fde\u63a5\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e0eICL\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790transformer\u5728\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfcICL\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0ICL\u6027\u80fd\u9075\u5faa\u5e42\u5f8b\u7f29\u653e\u5173\u7cfb\uff0ctransformer\u5728\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u03b7_eff = \u0398(1/\u221aLd)\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5904\u51fa\u73b0\u6025\u5267\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u6df1\u5ea6-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u4e3aL* \u221d N^{2/3}, d* \u221d N^{1/3}\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3aICL\u6d8c\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fc5\u8981\u548c\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86transformer\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u6307\u6570\u3002"}}

This limits downstream tasks that rely on understanding event salience, influence, or narrative focus. We introduce Protagonist Entity Recognition (PER), a task that identifies the organizations that anchor a news story and shape its main developments. To validate PER, we compare he predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) against annotations from four expert annotators over a gold corpus, establishing both inter-annotator consistency and human-LLM agreement. Leveraging these findings, we use state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically label large-scale news collections through NER-guided prompting, generating scalable, high-quality supervision. We then evaluate whether other LLMs, given reduced context and without explicit candidate guidance, can still infer the correct protagonists. Our results demonstrate that PER is a feasible and meaningful extension to narrative-centered information extraction, and that guided LLMs can approximate human judgments of narrative importance at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u89d2\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b(PER)\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u95fb\u6545\u4e8b\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u6807\u6ce8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfNER\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u4f53\u540c\u7b49\u5bf9\u5f85\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u6b63\u63a8\u52a8\u53d9\u4e8b\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NER\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u63a8\u65ad\u4e3b\u89d2\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660ePER\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684LLM\u80fd\u591f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u53d9\u4e8b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "PER\u662f\u9762\u5411\u53d9\u4e8b\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u6269\u5c55\uff0cLLM\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u95fb\u6545\u4e8b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u89d2\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002"}}

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \\textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that MoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in both knowledge retention and scalability to new tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial memory and computational savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMoSEs\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5b50\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5c0f\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u96be\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u91cd\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5206\u914d\u72ec\u7acb\u53c2\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb", "method": "\u5728Transformer\u5c42\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u6df7\u5408\u5b50\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5df2\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u53c2\u6570\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1", "result": "\u5728TRACE\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90", "conclusion": "MoSEs\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIEC\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5c06\u8bef\u5dee\u589e\u957f\u4ece\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u4fee\u6539\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u6548\u7387\u6280\u672f\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u800c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u96be\u4ee5\u4fee\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e2d\u5448\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "method": "IEC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5c06\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u4ece\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIEC\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u6548\u7387\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "IEC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u3002"}}

However, current MBRL methods focus primarily on building world models for single tasks and rarely address generalization across different scenarios. Building on the insight that dynamics within the same simulation engine share inherent properties, we attempt to construct a unified world model capable of generalizing across different scenarios, named Meta-Regularized Contextual World-Model (MrCoM). This method first decomposes the latent state space into various components based on the dynamic characteristics, thereby enhancing the accuracy of world-model prediction.

In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7531\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5e7b\u89c9\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u3001\u4e0d\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u9003\u907f\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b49\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u5e7b\u89c9\u9762\u524d\u57fa\u672c\u5931\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u91cd\u5927\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u7531\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u524d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5bf9\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5f00\u6e90\u53ca\u4e13\u6709LLM\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u57fa\u672c\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u63a2\u6d4b\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5e7b\u89c9\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u3001\u4e0d\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u9003\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing retrieval methods, such as traditional mass spectral library matching, suffer from limited spectral library coverage, while recent cross-modal representation learning frameworks often encounter modality misalignment, resulting in suboptimal retrieval accuracy and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GLMR, a Generative Language Model-based Retrieval framework that mitigates the cross-modal misalignment through a two-stage process. In the pre-retrieval stage, a contrastive learning-based model identifies top candidate molecules as contextual priors for the input mass spectrum. In the generative retrieval stage, these candidate molecules are integrated with the input mass spectrum to guide a generative model in producing refined molecular structures, which are then used to re-rank the candidates based on molecular similarity. Experiments on both MassSpecGym and the proposed MassRET-20k dataset demonstrate that GLMR significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 40% improvement in top-1 accuracy and exhibiting strong generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "GLMR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u8d28\u8c31-\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u8c31\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8c31\u5e93\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9884\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u5019\u9009\u5206\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u5019\u9009\u5206\u5b50\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u8d28\u8c31\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7cbe\u70bc\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728MassSpecGym\u548cMassRET-20k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGLMR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0ctop-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc740%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GLMR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u89e3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d28\u8c31\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For efficient deployment of these algorithms, although different techniques for the compression of neural network models are proposed, neural pruning is one of the fastest and effective methods, which can provide a high compression gain with minimal cost. To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Herein, we introduce CAMP-HiVe, a cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian Vector approximation by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, combining significant and less significant weights, thus effectively streamlining the model while preserving its performance. This dynamic, adaptive framework allows for real-time adjustment of weight significance, ensuring that only the most critical parameters are retained. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant reductions in computational requirements while maintaining high performance across different neural network architectures, e.g., ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2, on standard benchmark datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art neural pruning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eHessian\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5CAMP-HiVe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u914d\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u526a\u679d\u662f\u6700\u5feb\u901f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Hessian-vector\u4e58\u79ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e42\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u914d\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u7cbe\u7b80\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ResNet18\u3001ResNet56\u3001MobileNetv2\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u548cCIFAR10\u3001CIFAR-100\u3001ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CAMP-HiVe\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \\textbf{\\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \\textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \\textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \\textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NTK-Selector\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57dfLLM\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u76d1\u7763", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684NTK-like\u884c\u4e3a\u548cJacobian-free\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u56db\u4e2a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281000\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5185\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a09000\u4e2aNTK-Selector\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6837\u672c\u4f7fLlama3-8B-Instruct\u548cQwen3-8B\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53478.7\u548c5.1\u5206\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534710.9\u500d\u548c5.7\u500d", "conclusion": "NTK-Selector\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57dfLLM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

To address these limitations, we propose the Chaotic Oscillatory Transformer Network (COTN).

This design is specifically tailored to effectively capture chaotic dynamics and improve responsiveness during periods of heightened volatility, where conventional activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GELU) tend to saturate. Furthermore, COTN incorporates an Autoencoder Self-Regressive (ASR) module to detect and isolate abnormal market patterns, such as sudden price spikes or crashes, thereby preventing corruption of the core prediction process and enhancing robustness.

Most current research has focused on reducing the quadratic complexity of attention to address the resulting low training and inference efficiency. Among these works, Transolver stands out as a representative method that introduces Physics-Attention to reduce computational costs. Physics-Attention projects grid points into slices for slice attention, then maps them back through deslicing. However, we observe that Physics-Attention can be reformulated as a special case of linear attention, and that the slice attention may even hurt the model performance. Based on these observations, we argue that its effectiveness primarily arises from the slice and deslice operations rather than interactions between slices.

The growing availability of 3D geospatial data from multiple modalities has introduced new opportunities and challenges for integrating spatial knowledge at scale, particularly in high-impact domains such as urban planning and rapid disaster management. Geospatial entity resolution is the task of identifying matching spatial objects across different datasets, often collected independently under varying conditions. Existing approaches typically rely on spatial proximity, textual metadata, or external identifiers to determine correspondence. While useful, these signals are often unavailable, unreliable, or misaligned, especially in cross-source scenarios. To address these limitations, we shift the focus to the intrinsic geometry of 3D spatial objects and present 3dSAGER (3D Spatial-Aware Geospatial Entity Resolution), an end-to-end pipeline for geospatial entity resolution over 3D objects. 3dSAGER introduces a novel, spatial-reference-independent featurization mechanism that captures intricate geometric characteristics of matching pairs, enabling robust comparison even across datasets with incompatible coordinate systems where traditional spatial methods fail. As a key component of 3dSAGER, we also propose a new lightweight and interpretable blocking method, BKAFI, that leverages a trained model to efficiently generate high-recall candidate sets. We validate 3dSAGER through extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, demonstrating significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency over strong baselines.

Nevertheless, advances are dominated by mathematics (e.g., AIME), with competitive-programming code generation underexplored and data curation receiving less attention than RL algorithm design. We investigate how to construct RLVR datasets (i.e., RL prompts) and present practical training techniques that yield strong performance on competitive-programming code generation. Our pipeline begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) distilled from strong open-source models, augmented with general-purpose and reasoning-intensive data. RL then follows a two-stage process with executable, testcase-driven rewards: first, training on a large, uniformly distributed set of competitive-programming problems using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with 8 rollouts per prompt and a relatively short response-generation window (e.g., 32k during SFT and 24k in this stage) to expand entropy and mitigate repetition and truncation; second, we perform \\textbf{Pre-GRPO}: updating on a small, high-quality set of challenging problems with a large rollout budget (64 rollouts per prompt) under a hard-focus curriculum that continuously retains the most difficult instances throughout training. We implement our method on Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate on LeetCode and Codeforces weekly contests to avoid data leakage. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and is comparable to leading systems such as DeepSeek v3.1 and Doubao-1.5-Thinking.

These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features.

TTRL leverages an elegant two-phase sampling strategy: first, multi-sampling derives a pseudo-label via majority voting, while subsequent downsampling and reward-based fine-tuning encourages the model to explore and learn diverse valid solutions, with the pseudo-label modulating the reward signal. Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates. However, TTRL's two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which can potentially improve pseudo-label accuracy in the initial exploitation phase while regulating exploration in the second. To address this, we propose context-guided TTRL (CG-TTRL), integrating context dynamically into both sampling phases and propose a method for efficient context selection for on-device applications. Our evaluations on mathematical and scientific QA benchmarks show CG-TTRL outperforms TTRL (e.g. additional 7% relative accuracy improvement over TTRL), while boosting efficiency by obtaining strong performance after only a few steps of test-time training (e.g. 8% relative improvement rather than 1% over TTRL after 3 steps).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(CG-TTRL)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5230\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfTTRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTTRL\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5df2\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u521d\u59cb\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u8c03\u8282\u540e\u7eed\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "CG-TTRL\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\uff1a\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5229\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8c03\u8282\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCG-TTRL\u6bd4TTRL\u83b7\u5f97\u989d\u59167%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4ec53\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5c31\u80fd\u83b7\u5f978%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\uff08TTRL\u4ec5\u4e3a1%\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684TTRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that increasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the role of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance between information compression and representation complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faC3E\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u64ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff08\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff09", "method": "\u5c06\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5c06\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u57289\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cC3E\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u6e90\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u538b\u7f29", "conclusion": "\u589e\u52a0\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u66f4\u5fae\u5999\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5e73\u8861"}}

Specifically, FLEX cultivates scalable and inheritable evolution by constructing a structured experience library through continual reflection on successes and failures during interaction with the environment. FLEX delivers substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning, chemical retrosynthesis, and protein fitness prediction (up to 23% on AIME25, 10% on USPTO50k, and 14% on ProteinGym). We further identify a clear scaling law of experiential growth and the phenomenon of experience inheritance across agents, marking a step toward scalable and inheritable continuous agent evolution.

Current fusion methods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a limited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue presents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of specific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical applications. On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains. To complement this, we have also developed an open-source, unified, and automated evaluation pipeline that includes standardized implementations of state-of-the-art models and diverse fusion paradigms. Leveraging this platform, we have conducted large-scale experiments, successfully establishing new performance baselines across multiple tasks.

Conference version: NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight). Extended appendix included", "summary": "Consider the task of locating an unknown target point using approximate distance queries: in each round, a reconstructor selects a query point and receives a noisy version of its distance to the target. This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay.

Effectively modeling and analyzing such dynamic graph data is critical for tasks like predicting graph evolution and reconstructing missing graph data. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Koopman autoencoder (KAE) to handle time-varying graph data.

To capture the evolving graph structures, the graph data is first converted into a vector time series through graph embedding, representing the structural information in a finite-dimensional latent space.

We propose Sequence-level TopK (SeqTopK), a minimal modification that shifts the expert budget from the token level to the sequence level. By selecting the top $T \\cdot K$ experts across all $T$ tokens, SeqTopK enables end-to-end learned dynamic allocation -- assigning more experts to difficult tokens and fewer to easy ones -- while preserving the same overall budget. SeqTopK requires only a few lines of code, adds less than 1% overhead, and remains fully compatible with pretrained MoE models. Experiments across math, coding, law, and writing show consistent improvements over TopK and prior parameter-free adaptive methods, with gains that become substantially larger under higher sparsity (up to 16.9%).

However, generating these explanations for multivariate time series presents challenges due to their complex, multi-dimensional nature. Traditional Nearest Unlike Neighbor-based methods typically substitute subsequences in a queried time series with influential subsequences from an NUN, which is not always realistic in real-world scenarios due to the rigid direct substitution. Counterfactual with Residual Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods aim to address this by learning from the distribution of observed data to generate synthetic counterfactual explanations. However, these methods primarily focus on minimizing the cost from the queried time series to the counterfactual explanations and often neglect the importance of distancing the counterfactual explanation from the decision boundary. This oversight can result in explanations that no longer qualify as counterfactual if minor changes occur within the model. To generate a more robust counterfactual explanation, we introduce TriShGAN, under the CounteRGAN framework enhanced by the incorporation of triplet loss. This unsupervised learning approach uses distance metric learning to encourage the counterfactual explanations not only to remain close to the queried time series but also to capture the feature distribution of the instance with the desired outcome, thereby achieving a better balance between minimal cost and robustness.

Using vehicle-kinematic time series (e.g., speed, motor RPM), our model attains strong accuracy: RMSE 3.36 +/- 1.10, MAE 2.21 +/- 0.89, R-squared = 0.93 +/- 0.02, explained variance 0.93 +/- 0.02, and delivers well-calibrated uncertainty bands with near-nominal coverage. Against competitive baselines (Student-t MC dropout; quantile regression with/without anchoring), our method matches or improves log-scores while producing sharper intervals at the same coverage. Crucially for real-time deployment, inference is a single deterministic pass per ensemble member (or a weight-averaged collapse), eliminating Monte Carlo latency. The result is a compact, theoretically grounded estimator that couples accuracy, calibration, and systems efficiency, enabling reliable range estimation and decision-making for production EV energy management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u5b9a\u96c6\u6210LSTM\u548cStudent-t\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u529f\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u529f\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u65e2\u51c6\u786e\u53c8\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7eed\u822a\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u951a\u5b9a\u96c6\u6210LSTM\u7ed3\u5408Student-t\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u6743\u91cd\u5148\u9a8c\uff08MAP\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u83b7\u5f97\u540e\u9a8c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\uff0cStudent-t\u5934\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u5c3e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1aRMSE 3.36\u00b11.10\uff0cMAE 2.21\u00b10.89\uff0cR\u00b2=0.93\u00b10.02\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u5dee0.93\u00b10.02\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e26\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6807\u79f0\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u5355\u6b21\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u80fd\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \\textit{\\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \\emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \\textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers. In our models, retaining only 21\\% of the parameters achieves up to a 12\\% accuracy improvement and a 2.7$\\times$ inference speedup.

A critical yet often overlooked barrier lies in the computational and memory limitations of RAN baseband hardware, particularly in legacy 4th Generation (4G) systems, which typically lack on-chip neural accelerators. As a result, only lightweight AI models (under 1 Mb and sub-100~\u03bcs inference time) can be effectively deployed, limiting both their performance and applicability. However, achieving strong generalization across diverse network conditions often requires large-scale models with substantial resource demands. To address this trade-off, this paper investigates policy distillation in the context of a reinforcement learning-based link adaptation task. We explore two strategies: single-policy distillation, where a scenario-agnostic teacher model is compressed into one generalized student model; and multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student.

Prior work explores confidence estimation for self-evaluating LLM-scorer systems, with confidence scorers estimating the likelihood of errors in LLM responses.

In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Our findings demonstrate that self-evaluating LLM systems provide meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning, improving their trustworthiness and providing a practical framework for failure detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u8bc4\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9010\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6b65\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u6280\u672f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u76f4\u89c2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u6b65\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u9010\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\uff0cAUC-ROC\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe15%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5931\u8d25\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, in deep architectures, this process often leads to diminished expressiveness. A popular solution is to use residual connections, where the input from the current (or initial) layer is added to aggregated neighbor information to preserve embeddings across layers. Following a recent line of research, we investigate an adaptive residual scheme in which different nodes have varying residual strengths. We prove that this approach prevents oversmoothing; particularly, we show that the Dirichlet energy of the embeddings remains bounded away from zero. This is the first theoretical guarantee not only for the adaptive setting, but also for static residual connections (where residual strengths are shared across nodes) with activation functions. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that this adaptive approach outperforms standard and state-of-the-art message passing mechanisms, especially on heterophilic graphs. To improve the time complexity of our approach, we introduce a variant in which residual strengths are not learned but instead set heuristically, a choice that performs as well as the learnable version.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u6027\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8ba9\u4e0d\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d8\u4f53\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7248\u672c\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d8\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics.

A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f31\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u5f3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f31\u60e9\u7f5a\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08WP-NODE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u77ed\u671f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c0f\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u8fc5\u901f\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u77ed\u671f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u957f\u671f\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f31\u60e9\u7f5a\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08WP-NODE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5f31\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u5f3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u5f31\u5f62\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5b50\u57df\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210\u6b8b\u5dee\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5219\u57fa\u4e8eNODE\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6f14\u793a\u8868\u660e\uff0cWP-NODE\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5f31\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing data synthesis methods often exacerbate this problem by creating data with symmetric utility, allowing any party to extract its value. This paper introduces the Encapsulation-Forging (EnFo) framework, a novel approach to generate rival synthetic data with asymmetric utility. EnFo operates in two stages: it first encapsulates predictive knowledge from the original data into a designated ``key'' model, and then forges a synthetic dataset by optimizing the data to intentionally overfit this key model. This process transforms non-rival data into a rival product, ensuring its value is accessible only to the intended model, thereby preventing unauthorized use and preserving the data owner's competitive edge. Our framework demonstrates remarkable sample efficiency, matching the original data's performance with a fraction of its size, while providing robust privacy protection and resistance to misuse.

Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm.

To address these issues, we propose a $\\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\\textbf{S}$patial-$\\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST.

Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods verify the superiority of our proposed framework.

Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9\\% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark.

Although churn prediction and demand forecasting have been widely studied in B2B contexts, the use of machine learning to guide asset allocation remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a framework focused on predicting which beverage clients are most likely to deliver strong returns in volume after receiving a cooler. Using a private dataset from a well-known Central American brewing and beverage company of 3,119 B2B traditional trade channel clients that received a cooler from 2022-01 to 2024-07, and tracking 12 months of sales transactions before and after cooler installation, three growth thresholds were defined: 10%, 30% and 50% growth in sales volume year over year. The analysis compares results of machine learning models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost combined with SHAP for interpretable feature analysis in order to have insights into improving business operations related to cooler allocation; the results show that the best model has AUC scores of 0.857, 0.877, and 0.898 across the thresholds on the validation set. Simulations suggest that this approach can improve ROI because it better selects potential clients to grow at the expected level and increases cost savings by not assigning clients that will not grow, compared to traditional volume-based approaches with substantial business management recommendations", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u54ea\u4e9b\u996e\u6599\u5ba2\u6237\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u51b7\u85cf\u5c55\u793a\u67dc\u540e\u6700\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9500\u91cf\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u4ea7\u5206\u914d\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u884c\u4e1a\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u8d44\u4ea7\uff08\u5982\u5546\u7528\u996e\u6599\u51b7\u85cf\u67dc\uff09\u7684\u653e\u7f6e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1B2B\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6d41\u5931\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6307\u5bfc\u8d44\u4ea7\u5206\u914d\u4ecd\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u4e2d\u7f8e\u6d32\u77e5\u540d\u917f\u9152\u548c\u996e\u6599\u516c\u53f8\u76843,119\u4e2aB2B\u4f20\u7edf\u8d38\u6613\u6e20\u9053\u5ba2\u6237\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u51b7\u85cf\u67dc\u5b89\u88c5\u524d\u540e12\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u9500\u552e\u4ea4\u6613\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e8610%\u300130%\u548c50%\u4e09\u4e2a\u9500\u91cf\u540c\u6bd4\u589e\u957f\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86XGBoost\u3001LightGBM\u548cCatBoost\u7b49\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684AUC\u5f97\u5206\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.857\u30010.877\u548c0.898\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u9500\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u589e\u957f\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u5e76\u8282\u7701\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4ece\u51b7\u85cf\u67dc\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fd0\u8425\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u8d44\u4ea7\u5206\u914d\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion \"Teacher\" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled \"Student\" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods.

While cognitive tests and clinical data are routinely collected, they lack the predictive power of PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis, which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for every patient. To address this cost-accuracy dilemma, we design a two-stage machine learning framework that selectively obtains advanced, costly features based on their predicted \"value of information\". We apply our framework to predict AD progression for MCI patients using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework reduces the need for advanced testing by 20% while achieving a test AUROC of 0.929, comparable to the model that uses both basic and advanced features (AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010).

However, recent studies have shown that MML can underperform, even compared to single-modality approaches, due to imbalanced learning across modalities. Methods have been proposed to alleviate this imbalance issue using different heuristics, which often lead to computationally intensive subroutines. In this paper, we reformulate the MML problem as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem that overcomes the imbalanced learning issue among modalities and propose a gradient-based algorithm to solve the modified MML problem. We provide convergence guarantees for the proposed method, and empirical evaluations on popular MML benchmarks showcasing the improved performance of the proposed method over existing balanced MML and MOO baselines, with up to ~20x reduction in subroutine computation time.

We introduce CLaP (Causal Layerwise Peeling), a framework that separates causal signal from context in a layerwise manner and integrates diverse graph representations of molecules. At each layer, a causal block performs a soft split into causal and non-causal branches, fuses causal evidence across modalities, and progressively removes batch-coupled context to focus on label-relevant structure, thereby limiting shortcut signals and stabilizing layerwise refinement. Across four molecular benchmarks, CLaP consistently improves MAE, MSE, and $R^2$ over competitive baselines. The model also produces atom-level causal saliency maps that highlight substructures responsible for predictions, providing actionable guidance for targeted molecular edits.

Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMEA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6807\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u8c03\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982ELoRA\u867d\u7136\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5f20\u91cf\u9636\u5185\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u9ad8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e45\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u7b49\u53d8\u9002\u914d\u5668(MMEA)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6807\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u5728\u6bcf\u9636\u548c\u6bcf\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8c03\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMMEA\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5c06\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8c03\u5236\u901a\u9053\u5e45\u5ea6\u8db3\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7b49\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u5316\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7b49\u53d8PEFT\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this work, we show that the majority of new capabilities in reasoning models can be elicited by small, single-rank changes to base model parameters, with many of these changes being interpretable. Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors.

Moreover, these methods do not take global information into account, which is also crucial for mitigating the over-smoothing problem. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), which is a novel framework that integrates Mamba into GNNs to address over-smoothing from both local and global perspectives. DMbaGCN consists of two modules: the Local State-Evolution Mamba (LSEMba) for local neighborhood aggregation and utilizing Mamba's selective state space modeling to capture node-specific representation dynamics across layers, and the Global Context-Aware Mamba (GCAMba) that leverages Mamba's global attention capabilities to incorporate global context for each node.

Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning.

We propose Data Trajectory Alignment (DTA), a two-phase, model-agnostic data curation framework that treats solution processes - not only final answers - as first-class supervision. Phase I (Initializing) synthesizes diverse, high-coverage candidates using an ensemble of strong teachers. Phase II (DTA) rewrites teacher solutions to align intermediate steps and presentation style with the target student's inductive biases and then performs signal-aware exemplar selection via agreement checks and reflection-based judging. Instantiated on telecommunications mathematics (e.g., link budgets, SNR/AMC selection, and power-control feasibility), DTA yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on TELEMATH without enabling explicit \"thinking\" modes: 72.45% pass@1, surpassing distilled-only training by +17.65 points and outperforming a strong baseline (Qwen3-32B with thinking enabled) by +2.94 points. Token-shift analyses indicate that DTA concentrates gains on logical-structural discourse markers rather than merely amplifying domain nouns, indicating improved reasoning scaffolding. Under edge-like inference settings, DTA improves efficiency by reducing reliance on multi-sample voting and disabling expensive reasoning heuristics, cutting energy per output token by ~42% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode enabled) and end-to-end latency by ~60% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode disabled). These results demonstrate that aligning how solutions are produced enables compact, high-yield supervision that is effective for both accuracy and efficiency, offering a practical recipe for domain adaptation in low-resource verticals beyond telecom.", "AI": {"tldr": "DTA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89e3\u9898\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u7535\u4fe1\u6570\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u4fe1\u7b49\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u79fb\u52a8/\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5019\u9009\u89e3\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u5199\u6559\u5e08\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u5448\u73b0\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u53f7\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728TELEMATH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523072.45%\u7684pass@1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u4ec5\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u534717.65\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u6bd4\u542f\u7528\u4e86\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684Qwen3-32B\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53472.94\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bcf\u8f93\u51fatoken\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea642%\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea660%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \\emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \\emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $\u03b2$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items.

Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling.

Parameter sharing, a form of structured compression, effectively reduces redundancy, but existing approaches remain heuristic-restricted to adjacent layers and lacking a systematic analysis for cross-layer sharing. However, extending sharing across multiple layers leads to an exponentially expanding configuration space, making exhaustive search computationally infeasible and forming a critical bottleneck for parameter sharing. We recast parameter sharing from a group-theoretic perspective as introducing structural symmetries in the model's parameter space. A sharing configuration can be described by a coloring function $\u03b1:L\\rightarrow C$ (L: layer indices and C: sharing classes), which determines inter-layer sharing groups while preserving structural symmetry. To determine the coloring function, we propose a second-order geometric criterion based on Taylor expansion and the Hessian spectrum. By projecting perturbations onto the Hessian's low-curvature eigensubspace, the criterion provides an analytic rule for selecting sharing groups that minimize performance impact, yielding a principled and scalable configuration procedure.

Neglecting these trade-offs can lead to unintended consequences across sectors. However, existing assessments often evaluate emerging energy pathways and their impacts in silos, overlooking critical interactions such as regional resource competition and cumulative impacts. We present an integrated modeling framework that couples agent-based modeling and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to simulate how energy transition pathways interact with regional resource competition, ecological constraints, and community-level burdens. We apply the model to a case study in Southern California. The results demonstrate how integrated and multiscale decision making can shape energy pathway deployment and reveal spatially explicit trade-offs under scenario-driven constraints.

However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. On textual tasks, MIP-Editor achieves up to 80.65% forgetting and preserves 77.9% of general performance.

FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \\approx 0.45\\text{--}0.55$). We further validate the efficacy of the FedNET framework in predicting network utilization on a realistic network topology and demonstrate that it consistently identifies high-risk links well in advance (i.e., three days ahead) of the critical stress states emerging, making it a practical tool for anticipatory traffic engineering and capacity planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedNET\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u6b65\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u66b4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u6d41\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5df2\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\u6e90-\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u5bf9\u6d41\u91cf\u8d21\u732e\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u6765\u94fe\u8def\u7ea7\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u94fe\u8def\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u77ed\u9884\u6d4b\u5468\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff08R\u00b2>0.92\uff09\uff0c\u957f\u5468\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4ecd\u6709\u610f\u4e49\uff08R\u00b2\u22480.45-0.55\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u524d\u4e09\u5929\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u94fe\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "FedNET\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6d41\u91cf\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5173\u952e\u538b\u529b\u72b6\u6001\u51fa\u73b0\u524d\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002"}}

Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $\u03b3$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$\u03b3$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $\u03b3\\approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "FH-RL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u7a33\u6001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6307\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u90e8\u9012\u5f52\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ec5\u4ee5\u7eaf\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u90e8\u9012\u5f52\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u65b0\u8fdb\u5165\u5148\u524d\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u5230\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u601d\u8003\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH-RL)\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u7a33\u6001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u518d\u8fdb\u5165\u589e\u76ca\u03b3\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528IRR\u3001ESRI\u548cRDP\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u03b3\u22480.10-0.20\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u5e26\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff1aIRR\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e0a\u5347\uff0cESRI\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0cRDP\u5448\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u5468\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u9988\u653e\u5927\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u601d\u8003\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u6027\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u4ee3\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u76ae\u5c42\u518d\u8fdb\u5165\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002"}}

First, a physics informed conditional neural field is trained to approximate the nonlinear parametric solutionof the governing equations. This establishes a continuous mapping between the parameter and solution spaces, which can then be evaluated for a given parameter at any spatial resolution. Second, since the neural approximation may not be exact, it is subsequently refined using a Newton-based correction initialized by the neural output. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach, we compare three solution strategies: (i) the standard Newton-Raphson solver used in NFEM, which is robust and accurate but computationally demanding; (ii) physics-informed neural operators, which provide rapid inference but may lose accuracy outside the training distribution and resolution; and (iii) the neural-initialized Newton (NiN) strategy, which combines the efficiency of neural operators with the robustness of NFEM.

To address this, we propose CtrlFlow, a trajectory-level synthetic method using conditional flow matching (CFM), which directly modeling the distribution of trajectories from initial states to high-return terminal states without explicitly modeling the environment transition function. Our method ensures optimal trajectory sampling by minimizing the control energy governed by the non-linear Controllability Gramian Matrix, while the generated diverse trajectory data significantly enhances the robustness and cross-task generalization of policy learning. In online settings, CtrlFlow demonstrates the better performance on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks than dynamics models and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard MBRL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "CtrlFlow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u4ece\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u5230\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u7ec8\u7aef\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u79fb\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u5c55\u5f00\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5efa\u6a21\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u79fb\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCtrlFlow\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u4ece\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u5230\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u7ec8\u7aef\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7531\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u683c\u62c9\u59c6\u77e9\u9635\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u91cf\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cCtrlFlow\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u7684MuJoCo\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CtrlFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u975e\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, modern semiconductor technologies with densely packed structures present significant challenges in unbiasedly sampling transition domains in walk steps with multiple high-contrast dielectric materials. We present DeepRWCap, a machine learning-guided random walk solver that predicts the transition quantities required to guide each step of the walk. These include Poisson kernels, gradient kernels, signs and magnitudes of weights. DeepRWCap employs a two-stage neural architecture that decomposes structured outputs into face-wise distributions and spatial kernels on cube faces. It uses 3D convolutional networks to capture volumetric dielectric interactions and 2D depthwise separable convolutions to model localized kernel behavior. The design incorporates grid-based positional encodings and structural design choices informed by cube symmetries to reduce learning redundancy and improve generalization. Trained on 100,000 procedurally generated dielectric configurations, DeepRWCap achieves a mean relative error of $1.24\\pm0.53$\\% when benchmarked against the commercial Raphael solver on the self-capacitance estimation of 10 industrial designs spanning 12 to 55 nm nodes.

First, M2M-DC ranks residual (or inverted-residual) blocks by a label-aware mutual information (MI) signal and removes the least informative units (structured prune-after-training). It then alternates short KD phases with stage-coherent, residual-safe channel slicing: (i) stage \"planes\" (co-slicing conv2 out-channels with the downsample path and next-stage inputs), and (ii) an optional mid-channel trim (conv1 out / bn1 / conv2 in). This targets complementary redundancy, whole computational motifs and within-stage width while preserving residual shape invariants. On CIFAR-100, M2M-DC yields a clean accuracy-compute frontier. For ResNet-18, we obtain 85.46% Top-1 with 3.09M parameters and 0.0139 GMacs (72% params, 63% GMacs vs. teacher; mean final 85.29% over three seeds). For ResNet-34, we reach 85.02% Top-1 with 5.46M params and 0.0195 GMacs (74% / 74% vs. teacher; mean final 84.62%). Extending to inverted-residuals, MobileNetV2 achieves a mean final 68.54% Top-1 at 1.71M params (27%) and 0.0186 conv GMacs (24%), improving over the teacher's 66.03% by +2.5 points across three seeds. Because M2M-DC exposes only a thin, architecture-aware interface (blocks, stages, and down sample/skip wiring), it generalizes across residual CNNs and extends to inverted-residual families with minor legalization rules.

To overcome this, we introduce the non-conservative generalized Schr\u00f6dinger bridge (NCGSB), a novel, energy-varying reformulation based on contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity. Furthermore, CWG supports guided generation by modulating a task-specific distance metric.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) presents a promising solution, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning by updating only a small number of adaptation weights per layer. Traditional PEFT methods typically rely on a single expert, where the adaptation weight is a low-rank matrix. However, for complex tasks, the data's inherent diversity poses a significant challenge for such models, as a single adaptation weight cannot adequately capture the features of all samples. To address this limitation, we explore how to integrate multiple small adaptation experts into a compact structure to defeat a large adapter. Specifically, we propose Tucker Adaptation (TuckA), a method with four key properties: (i) We use Tucker decomposition to create a compact 3D tensor where each slice naturally serves as an expert. The low-rank nature of this decomposition ensures that the number of parameters scales efficiently as more experts are added. (ii) We introduce a hierarchical strategy that organizes these experts into groups at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both local and global data patterns. (iii) We develop an efficient batch-level routing mechanism, which reduces the router's parameter size by a factor of $L$ compared to routing at every adapted layer (where $L$ is the number of adapted layers) (iv) We propose data-aware initialization to achieve loss-free expert load balancing based on theoretical analysis.

Consequently, most forecasting methods display compromised robustness to concept drift, despite the prevalent application of instance normalization. We tackle this challenge by first analysing concept drift through a bias-variance lens and proving that weighted ensemble reduces variance without increasing bias. These insights motivate DeepBooTS, a novel end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method that progressively reconstructs the intrinsic signal. In our design, each block of a deep model becomes an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction.

This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: a Kalman Smoothing Post-processor that provably operates as a statistically optimal estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. The synergy between these two components allows COGNOS to robustly separate the true anomaly signal from random fluctuations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGNOS is highly effective, delivering an average F-score uplift of 57.9% when applied to 12 diverse backbone models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets.

Recent works improve this by introducing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, with the pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) used as teachers and the target SNNs as students. This is commonly accomplished through a straightforward element-wise alignment of intermediate features and prediction logits from ANNs and SNNs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences between their architectures. Specifically, ANN's outputs exhibit a continuous distribution, whereas SNN's outputs are characterized by sparsity and discreteness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two innovative KD strategies. Firstly, we propose the Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD), which aligns the spike activation map of the student SNN with the class-aware activation map of the teacher ANN. Rather than performing KD directly on the raw %and distinct features of ANN and SNN, our SAMD directs the student to learn from saliency activation maps that exhibit greater semantic and distribution consistency. Additionally, we propose a Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD), which utilizes Gaussian noise to smooth the sparse logits of student SNN, facilitating the alignment with continuous logits from teacher ANN.

In addition, we present methods for analyzing the influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting CEs. We validate the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, showcasing its accuracy and practical applicability. These contributions are expected to support real-world decision-making based on time series data analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u4f46\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6790\u5404\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u4ec5\u6539\u53d8\u7279\u5b9a\u53d8\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u8425\u9500\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To meet this need, data is collected from multiple domains, such as Wikipedia and GitHub. These domains are heterogeneous in both data quality and the diversity of information they provide. This raises the question of how much we should rely on each domain. Several methods have attempted to address this issue by assigning sampling weights to each data domain using heuristics or approximations. As a first step toward a deeper understanding of the role of data mixing, this work revisits the problem by studying two kinds of weights: sampling weights, which control how much each domain contributes in a batch, and loss weights, which scale the loss from each domain during training. Through a rigorous study of linear regression, we show that these two weights play complementary roles. First, they can reduce the variance of gradient estimates in iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Second, they can improve generalization performance by reducing the generalization gap. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for these claims. We further study the joint dynamics of sampling weights and loss weights, examining how they can be combined to capture both contributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u8d28\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982Wikipedia\u548cGitHub\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u5728\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5408\u7406\u5206\u914d\u5404\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u6743\u91cd\uff1a\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\uff08\u63a7\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5728\u6279\u6b21\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff09\u548c\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\uff08\u7f29\u653e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u9ad8\u65af\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u957f\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u6807\u8bb0\u5747\u5300\u5206\u914d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u800cRL\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5c11\u6570\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5934\u90e8\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a(i) \u6bcf\u5934\u8bb0\u5fc6\u957f\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9650\u5236\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7a97\u53e3\uff1b(ii) \u5206\u5e03\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8fc7\u53bb\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u9ad8\u65af\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5728Atari 100k\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8677%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6765\u81ea\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u914d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5230\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4bRL\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u5e03\u5148\u9a8c\u6bd4\u79bb\u6563\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7a97\u53e3\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u91ce\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers promise in such settings, it remains challenging in tabular domains due to the lack of effective data augmentations. We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases.

This paper introduces a novel, unifying framework for fast Bayesian updates by leveraging harmonic analysis. We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution. This formulation allows us to exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity -- a substantial improvement over the O(N^2) cost of naive methods.

However, existing SC methods, which are largely based on linear models or shallow neural networks, face significant limitations in terms of scalability and capacity when applied to real-world datasets with significantly increasing scale, especially in financial services and the internet sector. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage large language models to design a more scalable and efficient SC framework, especially in the case of growing individuals engaged with decision-making processes. Specifically, we introduce GLIM, a gradient-free SC method grounded in in-context learning. During the feed-forward process of self-attention, GLIM implicitly simulates the typical bi-level optimization process of SC, including both the feature manipulation and decision rule optimization.

In the second stage, we fine-tune on PDBBind by fusing sequence and structure information through a residue-level gating module, while introducing an auxiliary binding site prediction task. This auxiliary task guides the model to accurately localize binding residues within the protein sequence and capture their 3D spatial arrangement, thereby refining protein-ligand matching.

However, existing GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions, which is rarely valid in practice. In real-world scenarios, unseen but normal samples may emerge during deployment, leading to a normality shift that degrades the performance of GAD models trained on the original data. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that the degradation arises from (1) semantic confusion, where unseen normal samples are misinterpreted as anomalies due to their novel patterns, and (2) aggregation contamination, where the representations of seen normal nodes are distorted by unseen normals through message aggregation. While retraining or fine-tuning GAD models could be a potential solution to the above challenges, the high cost of model retraining and the difficulty of obtaining labeled data often render this approach impractical in real-world applications. To bridge the gap, we proposed a lightweight and plug-and-play Test-time adaptation framework for correcting Unseen Normal pattErns (TUNE) in GAD. To address semantic confusion, a graph aligner is employed to align the shifted data to the original one at the graph attribute level. Moreover, we utilize the minimization of representation-level shift as a supervision signal to train the aligner, which leverages the estimated aggregation contamination as a key indicator of normality shift. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that TUNE significantly enhances the generalizability of pre-trained GAD models to both synthetic and real unseen normal patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TUNE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\u548c\u8868\u793a\u7ea7\u504f\u79fb\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u90e8\u7f72\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u672a\u89c1\u4f46\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u6837\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f88\u5c11\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTUNE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u504f\u79fb\u6570\u636e\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u8868\u793a\u7ea7\u504f\u79fb\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\uff1b3) \u5c06\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u805a\u5408\u6c61\u67d3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u6001\u6027\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTUNE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u672a\u89c1\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TUNE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u6001\u6027\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u83b7\u53d6\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

We study quantization-aware training (QAT) of policies for integer inference and we present a learning-to-hardware pipeline that automatically selects low-bit policies and synthesizes them to an Artix-7 FPGA. Across five MuJoCo tasks, we obtain policy networks that are competitive with full precision (FP32) policies but require as few as 3 or even only 2 bits per weight, and per internal activation value, as long as input precision is chosen carefully. On the target hardware, the selected policies achieve inference latencies on the order of microseconds and consume microjoules per action, favorably comparing to a quantized reference.

Building on this insight, we propose Trajectory-Aware Reconstruction (TAR), an attack that combines temporal assignment information with algebraic analysis to recover exact original inputs. Our findings provide the first rigorous evidence, supported by a practical attack, that centroid disclosure in federated clustering significantly compromises privacy, exposing a fundamental tension between privacy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5TAR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528k-means\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u91cd\u5efa\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u534f\u8bae\u4e3a\u4e86\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u516c\u5f00\u4e2d\u95f4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u6cc4\u9732\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u7684HSSP\u653b\u51fb\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8fd9\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\u6cc4\u9732\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5371\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u5efa(TAR)\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4ee3\u6570\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5229\u7528k-means\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "TAR\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u653b\u51fb\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\u6cc4\u9732\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5bb3\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\u7684\u62ab\u9732\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior. We explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with explicit control over continuous musical attributes.

However, their synergy remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of systematic benchmarks evaluating their integration in clinical risk prediction. In real-world healthcare, identifying features with causal influence on outcomes is crucial for actionable and trustworthy predictions. While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike existing LLM-clinical benchmarks that often focus on a limited set of outcomes, REACT-LLM evaluates 7 clinical outcomes across 2 real-world datasets, comparing 15 prominent LLMs, 6 traditional ML models, and 3 causal discovery (CD) algorithms. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed traditional ML models. Integrating causal features derived from CD algorithms into LLMs offers limited performance gains, primarily due to the strict assumptions of many CD methods, which are often violated in complex clinical data.

In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity.

Traditional methods typically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., \"yes/no\") that specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in practical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty due to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities, and the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using simplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the expressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to better capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient fuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original data, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced representations. Based on this foundation, we present fuzzy-label-enhanced algorithms for both single-label and multi-label learning, using the classical K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and multi-label KNN algorithms as illustrative examples. Experimental results indicate that fuzzy labels can more effectively characterize the real-world labeling information and significantly enhance the performance of label learning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u793a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u903b\u8f91\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u6807\u6ce8\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5KNN\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7eKNN\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8868\u5f81\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u548c\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Corresponding author: Xuan Zhang (xuanzhang2199@gmail.com)", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive generalization abilities, yet adapting them effectively across multiple heterogeneous domains remains challenging due to inter-domain interference. To overcome this challenge, we propose a partition-based multi-stage fine-tuning framework designed to exploit inter-domain synergies while minimizing negative transfer. Our approach strategically partitions domains into subsets (stages) by balancing domain discrepancy, synergy, and model capacity constraints.

Current multi-modal solutions suffer from static semantic rigidity: predefined candidate words fail to adapt to dataset-specific concepts, and fixed fusion strategies ignore evolving feature interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-DProxy, a novel multi-modal dynamic proxy learning framework that leverages cross-modal alignment through learnable textual proxies. Multi-DProxy introduces 1) gated cross-modal fusion that synthesizes discriminative joint representations by adaptively modeling feature interactions. 2) dual-constraint proxy optimization where user interest constraints enforce semantic consistency with domain concepts while concept constraints employ hard example mining to enhance cluster discrimination. 3) dynamic candidate management that refines textual proxies through iterative clustering feedback. Therefore, Multi-DProxy not only effectively captures a user's interest through proxies but also enables the identification of relevant clusterings with greater precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over existing methods across a broad set of multi-clustering benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Multi-DProxy\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u7528\u6237\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u591a\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u591a\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u521a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5019\u9009\u8bcd\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5ffd\u7565\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u95e8\u63a7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b2) \u53cc\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee3\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea6\u675f\u901a\u8fc7\u96be\u4f8b\u6316\u6398\u589e\u5f3a\u805a\u7c7b\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u52a8\u6001\u5019\u9009\u7ba1\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u805a\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u6587\u672c\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u805a\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Multi-DProxy\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u6355\u83b7\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u521a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-graph heterogeneous GNN framework (MG-HGNN) to enhance spatial awareness and improve positioning performance. In this framework, two graph construction branches perform node and edge embedding, respectively, to generate informative graphs. Subsequently, a heterogeneous graph neural network is employed for graph representation learning, enabling accurate positioning. The MG-HGNN framework introduces the following key innovations: 1) multi-type task-directed graph construction that combines label estimation and feature encoding for richer graph information; 2) a heterogeneous GNN structure that enhances the performance of conventional GNN models. Evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc public datasets demonstrate that MG-HGNN not only achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, but also provides a novel perspective for enhancing GNN-based localization methods.

While these expressive models do not yet match the peak performance of state-of-the-art Transformers, their potential has been largely untapped due to prohibitively slow training and low hardware utilization. Existing parallelization methods force a fundamental conflict governed by the chunksize hyperparameter: large chunks boost speed but degrade performance, necessitating a fixed, suboptimal compromise. To solve this challenge, we introduce TNT, a novel training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance through a two-stage process. Stage one is an efficiency-focused pre-training phase utilizing a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details. Crucially, by periodically resetting local memory states, we break sequential dependencies to enable massive context parallelization. Stage two is a brief fine-tuning phase where only the local memory modules are adapted to a smaller, high-resolution chunksize, maximizing accuracy with minimal overhead. Evaluated on Titans and TTT models, TNT achieves a substantial acceleration in training speed-up to 17 times faster than the most accurate baseline configuration - while simultaneously improving model accuracy.

Building on this perspective, we develop a thermodynamic framework to describe the stationary distributions of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with weight decay for scale-invariant neural networks, a setting that both reflects practical architectures with normalization layers and permits theoretical analysis. We establish analogies between training hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, weight decay) and thermodynamic variables such as temperature, pressure, and volume. Starting with a simplified isotropic noise model, we uncover a close correspondence between SGD dynamics and ideal gas behavior, validated through theory and simulation. Extending to training of neural networks, we show that key predictions of the framework, including the behavior of stationary entropy, align closely with experimental observations.

While recent work highlights the role of exploration and entropy stability in improving pass@K, empirical evidence points to a paradox: RLVR and ORM/PRM typically reinforce existing tree-like reasoning paths rather than expanding the reasoning scope, raising the question of why exploration helps at all if no new patterns emerge.\n  To reconcile this paradox, we adopt the perspective of Kim et al. (2025), viewing easy (e.g., simplifying a fraction) versus hard (e.g., discovering a symmetry) reasoning steps as low- versus high-probability Markov transitions, and formalize post-training dynamics through Multi-task Tree-structured Markov Chains (TMC). In this tractable model, pretraining corresponds to tree expansion, while post-training corresponds to chain-of-thought reweighting. We show that several phenomena recently observed in empirical studies arise naturally in this setting: (1) RLVR induces a squeezing effect, reducing reasoning entropy and forgetting some correct paths; (2) population rewards of ORM/PRM encourage consistency rather than accuracy, thereby favoring common patterns; and (3) certain rare, high-uncertainty reasoning paths by the base model are responsible for solving hard problem instances.\n  Together, these explain why exploration -- even when confined to the base model's reasoning scope -- remains essential: it preserves access to rare but crucial reasoning traces needed for difficult cases, which are squeezed out by RLVR or unfavored by inference scaling. Building on this, we further show that exploration strategies such as rejecting easy instances and KL regularization help preserve rare reasoning traces. Empirical simulations corroborate our theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u72b6\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u867d\u7136RLVR\u548cORM/PRM\u4e3b\u8981\u5f3a\u5316\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u63a2\u7d22\u4ecd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u63a2\u7d22\u5728RLVR\u548cORM/PRM\u4e3b\u8981\u5f3a\u5316\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6811\u72b6\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u4e3a\u6811\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u4e3a\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0RLVR\u4ea7\u751f\u6324\u538b\u6548\u5e94\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u71b5\uff0cORM/PRM\u5956\u52b1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u800c\u975e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5373\u4f7f\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u56f4\u4e5f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u56f0\u96be\u6848\u4f8b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f1a\u88abRLVR\u6324\u538b\u6216\u88ab\u63a8\u7406\u7f29\u653e\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002"}}

Fractal templates allow for structural recursion and multi-column pathways, thus, models become deeper and wider in a balanced way.

Under mild complexity conditions linking consecutive curriculum stages, we show that curriculum post-training avoids the exponential complexity bottleneck.\n  To substantiate this result, drawing insights from the Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) solving mathematical problems such as Countdown and parity, we model CoT generation as a states-conditioned autoregressive reasoning tree, define a uniform-branching base model to capture pretrained behavior, and formalize curriculum stages as either depth-increasing (longer reasoning chains) or hint-decreasing (shorter prefixes) subtasks. Our analysis shows that, under outcome-only reward signals, reinforcement learning finetuning achieves high accuracy with polynomial sample complexity, whereas direct learning suffers from an exponential bottleneck.

Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym.

By focusing on minimizing regret with respect to the most powerful model (MPM), C3PO avoids the need for labeled data by constructing a cascade using only unlabeled model outputs. It leverages conformal prediction to bound the probability that inference cost exceeds a user-specified budget. We provide theoretical guarantees on both cost control and generalization error, and show that our optimization procedure is effective even with small calibration sets. Empirically, C3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, BigBench-Hard and AIME, outperforming strong LLM cascading baselines in both accuracy and cost-efficiency. Our results demonstrate that principled, label-free cascade optimization can enable scalable LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "C3PO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684LLM\u7ea7\u8054\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u7ea7\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7ea7\u8054\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC3PO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5f3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9057\u61be\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u7ea7\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u3001MATH-500\u3001BigBench-Hard\u548cAIME\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7ea7\u8054\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5219\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u7ea7\u8054\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, evaluations on broad downstream tasks reveal a consistent suboptimality of the routers in existing MoE LLMs, which results in a severe performance gap (e.g., 10-20% in accuracy) to the optimal routing. In this paper, we show that aligning the manifold of routing weights with that of task embedding can effectively reduce the gap and improve MoE LLMs' generalization performance. Our method, \"Routing Manifold Alignment (RoMA)\", introduces an additional manifold regularization term in the post-training objective and only requires lightweight finetuning of routers (with other parameters frozen). Specifically, the regularization encourages the routing weights of each sample to be close to those of its successful neighbors (whose routing weights lead to correct answers) in a task embedding space. Consequently, samples targeting similar tasks will share similar expert choices across layers. Building such bindings between tasks and experts over different samples is essential to achieve better generalization. Moreover, RoMA demonstrates the advantage of unifying the task understanding (by embedding models) with solution generation (by MoE LLMs). In experiments, we finetune routers in OLMoE, DeepSeekMoE, and Qwen3-MoE using RoMA.

Many different internal validity indexes exist for the purpose of determining the best clustering solution(s) from a given collection of candidates, e.g., as produced by different algorithms or different algorithm hyper-parameters. In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark study of 26 internal validity indexes, which includes highly popular classic indexes as well as more recently developed ones. We adopted an enhanced revision of the methodology presented in Vendramin et al. (2010), developed here to address several shortcomings of this previous work. This overall new approach consists of three complementary custom-tailored evaluation sub-methodologies, each of which has been designed to assess specific aspects of an index's behaviour while preventing potential biases of the other sub-methodologies. Each sub-methodology features two complementary measures of performance, alongside mechanisms that allow for an in-depth investigation of more complex behaviours of the internal validity indexes under study. Additionally, a new collection of 16177 datasets has been produced, paired with eight widely-used clustering algorithms, for a wider applicability scope and representation of more diverse clustering scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf926\u79cd\u5185\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ecf\u5178\u6307\u6807\u548c\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e09\u91cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e16177\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c8\u79cd\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e09\u91cd\u5b9a\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bcf\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f7f\u752816177\u4e2a\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c8\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u5185\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}
