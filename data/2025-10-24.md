### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC模型用于在线科学学习讨论的知识建构水平自动分类，在YouTube科学频道评论数据集上取得了0.836的宏F1分数，显著优于传统和transformer基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够自动识别在线科学学习环境中知识建构水平的工具，以支持大规模的非正式数字学习环境中的话语分析。

Method: 扩展DeBERTa-v3模型，结合Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化技术来处理类别不平衡和增强泛化能力，构建了端到端的可复现流程。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，模型宏F1达到0.836±0.008，在Explore和Negotiate等高阶认知参与类别上表现出色，显著优于基线模型(p<0.01)。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识建构的细微指标，为话语分析和认知参与评估工具的开发提供了可扩展的理论指导方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReDiff是一个改进的离散扩散模型框架，通过主动精炼机制解决并行解码中的错误级联问题，显著提升生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散扩散模型存在训练-推理差异，导致并行解码时初始令牌错误会污染生成上下文，引发错误级联，造成语法错误和语义幻觉。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段训练模型修正合成错误，建立基础修订能力；第二阶段通过在线自校正循环，让模型学习修正自身生成的缺陷草稿。

Result: 实验表明ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了比传统去噪方法更稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: ReDiff通过将生成过程从被动去噪重构为主动精炼，有效打破了错误级联，为离散扩散模型的实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Sparse Tracing技术，通过动态稀疏注意力高效分析长上下文注意力模式，Stream算法在近线性时间和线性空间内估计稀疏注意力掩码，使大规模单次可解释性成为可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型扩展到百万token上下文，传统机制可解释性技术的注意力分析随上下文长度呈二次方增长，超过10万token时需要TB级内存，无法处理长上下文。

Method: 引入Stream算法，采用可编译的分层剪枝方法，通过二分搜索式精化保留每个查询的前k个关键块，同时保持模型的下一个token行为。

Result: 在长思维链推理轨迹中识别思维锚点，剪枝97-99%的token交互；在RULER基准测试中保留关键检索路径，丢弃90-96%的交互，揭示从针到输出的分层路径。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing为分析注意力模式和追踪信息流提供了实用的即插即用工具，无需TB级缓存，使长上下文可解释性在消费级GPU上可行，有助于民主化思维链监控。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本，以确定患者是否适合进行HIV进一步检测的新流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV的高效筛查和早期诊断对减少传播至关重要，现有研究主要关注结构化数据，但忽略了非结构化文本数据中可能包含的HIV风险相关信息。

Method: 开发了一个新颖的流程，利用大语言模型分析非结构化EHR文本数据，评估患者进行HIV检测的资格。

Result: 在伊拉斯谟大学医学中心鹿特丹分校的临床数据上进行的实验表明，该流程实现了高准确率，同时保持了较低假阴性率。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了利用大语言模型分析非结构化EHR文本在HIV筛查中的有效性，为改进HIV诊断提供了新途径。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次通过专家基准测试评估了11个通用大语言模型在生命周期评估(LCA)任务中的表现，发现37%的回复包含不准确或误导性信息，但模型在解释质量和格式遵循方面表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能和大语言模型越来越多地被探索用于支持生命周期评估，但缺乏对其可靠性、鲁棒性和可用性的系统性证据，且该领域缺乏标准化的评估框架。

Method: 评估了11个通用大语言模型(包括商业和开源模型)在22个LCA相关任务中的表现，由17位经验丰富的从业者根据科学准确性、解释质量、鲁棒性、可验证性和指令遵循等标准审查模型输出，共收集168份专家评审。

Result: 专家判定37%的回复包含不准确或误导信息；准确性和解释质量评分普遍为平均或良好；格式遵循评分普遍较好；幻觉率差异显著，某些模型产生虚假引用的比例高达40%；开源模型在准确性和解释质量等标准上与闭源模型表现相当或更优。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LCA中简单应用LLM的风险，特别是在将LLM视为自由形式神谕时，但也显示了其在解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度方面的益处。没有基础机制支持的通用LLM使用存在风险。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于游戏的评估方法，通过Dixit卡牌游戏来全面评估多模态大语言模型的能力，克服传统静态基准测试和主观比较的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态大语言模型评估存在静态基准测试无法综合评估能力、人工或模型比较主观且昂贵、模型可能利用表面特征（如冗长性）来虚增胜率等问题。

Method: 采用游戏化评估框架，具体通过Dixit幻想卡牌游戏实现，该游戏要求玩家为卡片生成能误导部分但非全部玩家选择该卡片的描述。

Result: 对五个多模态大语言模型的定量实验显示，Dixit胜率排名与流行基准测试排名完全一致，同时人类与模型玩家的游戏揭示了策略差异和改进空间。

Conclusion: 游戏化评估为多模态大语言模型提供了更全面、客观和吸引人的评估框架，能够有效识别模型推理能力的差异和改进方向。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估DeepSeek-R1 LLM在运筹学优化建模中的应用潜力，通过系统测试四个OR基准并开发幻觉缓解策略来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法依赖领域专家将实际问题转化为数学模型，LLM有望通过自然语言理解和代码生成来弥合这一建模差距。

Method: 在四个OR基准上系统评估DeepSeek-R1，开发幻觉分类法，并应用LLM-as-a-Judge、Few-shot Learning、工具调用和多智能体框架等缓解策略。

Result: DeepSeek-R1作为成本效益高、性能良好的模型，在LiveCodeBench和Math-500等基准上表现优异，但在应用OR场景中的效果仍需探索。

Conclusion: 通过系统评估和幻觉缓解策略，DeepSeek-R1在运筹学优化建模中具有应用潜力，能够减少幻觉、提高建模精度并更好地对齐用户意图。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

### [9] [Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897)
*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强的LLM代理框架，通过存储实例级批评和提炼任务级指导，无需参数更新即可从标记示例中学习分类函数，相比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升达24.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、不灵活且不透明，需要探索无需参数更新就能让LLM代理从标记示例中学习的方法。

Method: 使用情景记忆存储实例级批评（特定过去经验），语义记忆将这些批评提炼为可重用的任务级指导，结合标记数据和LLM生成的批评进行学习。

Result: 在多样化任务集上，融入批评相比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升达24.8%，揭示了OpenAI和开源模型在处理事实导向与偏好数据时的行为差异。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的反思性学习为构建更具适应性和可解释性的LLM代理提供了前景，模型特性和记忆策略共同塑造学习动态。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR是一个无监督歌词翻译框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应课程策略，在段落级别实现可控歌词翻译，显著提升翻译质量并减少40%训练步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以内化音乐语言模式，在需要跨行连贯性和全局韵律的段落级别泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出LyriCAR框架，包含难度感知课程设计器和自适应课程策略，以无监督方式逐步引导模型处理越来越复杂的挑战。

Result: 在英中歌词翻译任务中，LyriCAR在标准翻译指标和多维奖励分数上均达到最先进水平，自适应课程策略减少近40%训练步骤。

Conclusion: LyriCAR通过课程学习有效解决了歌词翻译中的音乐约束平衡问题，实现了高质量的无监督段落级歌词翻译。

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

### [11] [On the Detectability of LLM-Generated Text: What Exactly Is LLM-Generated Text?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20810)
*Mingmeng Geng,Thierry Poibeau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出当前LLM生成文本检测面临定义模糊、检测目标不明确、现实应用条件复杂等问题，导致检测器结果常被误解，建议将检测结果仅作为参考而非决定性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，检测其生成文本的需求日益增长，但缺乏对"LLM生成文本"的统一定义，且现实使用场景复杂多样，现有检测方法难以有效应对。

Method: 通过分析LLM生成文本检测面临的挑战，包括定义模糊、人类编辑影响、模型多样性等问题，指出现有基准和评估方法的不足。

Result: 发现现有检测器的数值结果常被误解，其实际意义正在减弱，检测器仅在特定条件下有效。

Conclusion: LLM生成文本检测器在特定条件下仍然有用，但检测结果应仅作为参考而非决定性指标，需要更准确地理解检测结果的局限性。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型和符号自然语言理解的混合方法，旨在获得两种方法的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉和输出不一致的问题，而符号NLU系统虽然可解释但覆盖范围有限且需要专业知识维护。希望结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用LLM进行重述和文本简化以提供广泛覆盖，并作为填补知识缺口的来源；使用符号NLU生成可用于推理和增量学习的结构化表示。

Result: 在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量及因果规律的任务上，混合方法显著优于纯符号方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效结合了LLM的广泛覆盖能力和符号NLU的结构化表示优势，在特定任务上表现优于单一方法。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

*Michael A. Covington*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于依赖关系树解析自然语言句子的基础算法，该算法一次处理一个单词，在可连接时立即连接，模拟人脑解析过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种更接近人脑处理方式的自然语言解析算法，与短语结构解析不同，采用逐个单词处理的依赖关系解析方法。

Method: 采用依赖关系解析方法，逐个单词处理，在可连接时立即连接单词，构建依赖关系树。

Result: 算法的最坏情况复杂度为O(n^3)，但在人类语言中，最坏情况仅出现在小规模n时。

Conclusion: 该依赖关系解析算法模拟了人脑的解析过程，在人类语言中具有实际可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

*Yunpeng Xiao,Carl Yang,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一范式，从临床背景和临床问题两个维度来评估LLMs在临床决策中的表现，强调真实临床环境的复杂性，并扩展了评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学数据集（如MedQA）采用简化的问答形式，无法充分反映真实临床决策的复杂性，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 建立二维评估范式（临床背景和临床问题），总结现有数据集设置，回顾训练时和测试时技术，并扩展评估指标到效率、可解释性等维度。

Result: 该范式能够澄清假设、标准化比较，并为开发具有临床意义的LLMs提供指导。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架有助于更准确地评估LLMs在临床决策中的表现，推动开发真正有临床价值的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically

TL;DR: 提出了希腊嵌入模型(GEM)系列，针对希腊语构建了大规模语料库，训练了多种现代架构模型，并在法律领域创建了首个希腊-英语双语嵌入模型，显著超越现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决希腊语等形态丰富、资源中等语言在NLP研究中的挑战，特别是在法律等专业领域，现有模型受限于早期transformer架构和512个token的上下文长度，无法处理长法律文档。

Method: 构建大规模希腊语语料库，采用严格的质量驱动过滤和预处理方法，预训练多种现代架构(ELECTRA、ConvBERT、ModernBERT)，并创建希腊-英语双语法律领域嵌入模型。

Result: GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型在下游任务中显著优于现有基线，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过精心策划的数据和多样化现代架构，成功提升了希腊语NLP性能，特别是在法律领域，为中等资源语言提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

TL;DR: 本博士论文通过引入多任务模型、架构修改和生成式上下文微调框架，改进了序列标注任务的迁移学习方法，显著提升了预训练语言模型在序列标注任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练语言模型在序列标注任务上的迁移学习效果仍有提升空间，需要更有效的适应方法来充分发挥其潜力。

Method: 提出三种改进方法：1) 多任务模型整合领域无关信号；2) 修改自回归大语言模型架构实现层间双向信息流；3) 生成式监督上下文微调框架结合响应导向适应策略。

Result: 提出的模型、方法和框架证明，通过有针对性的迁移学习范式，预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务上能达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 针对性的迁移学习范式是提升预训练语言模型在序列标注任务上性能的关键，多任务学习、架构修改和生成式上下文微调是有效的改进方向。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

TL;DR: ToolScope通过工具合并和检索机制解决LLM工具使用中的冗余和上下文限制问题，显著提升工具选择准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界工具集存在冗余工具，工具名称和描述重叠导致歧义，降低选择准确率；同时LLM面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法有效处理大型工具集

Method: 提出ToolScope框架：(1) ToolScopeMerger带自动校正功能，自动审计和修复工具合并，减少冗余；(2) ToolScopeRetriever对每个查询进行工具排序和选择，压缩工具集以适应上下文限制

Result: 在三个最先进LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试中，工具选择准确率提升8.38%到38.6%

Conclusion: ToolScope能有效增强LLM工具使用能力，解决工具冗余和上下文限制问题

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言基准测试在捕捉低资源文化细微差别方面存在不足，需要专门的文化知识评估数据集来填补这一空白。

Method: 创建了包含民间传统、烹饪艺术和地区方言的孟加拉语文化知识数据集BLanCK，并评估了多个多语言语言模型在该数据集上的表现。

Result: 多语言模型在非文化类别表现良好，但在文化知识方面表现显著不佳；当提供上下文时，所有模型的性能都大幅提升。

Conclusion: 需要上下文感知架构和文化精心策划的训练数据来提升模型在低资源文化知识方面的表现。

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

TL;DR: 使用RLAIF和DPO方法增强波斯语小语言模型的医疗推理能力，通过翻译医疗问答数据集并生成推理轨迹，在较小数据集上超越了之前需要更多数据训练的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升小语言模型在专业领域（如波斯语医疗问答）的推理能力，解决资源匮乏语言中数据有限的问题。

Method: 将多选医疗问答数据集翻译成波斯语，使用RLAIF生成拒绝-偏好答案对，通过CoT推理生成正确和错误的推理轨迹，使用DPO进行训练。

Result: 训练后的模型在仅使用450万token数据集的情况下，超越了之前使用5700万token训练的gaokerena-V模型，显著提升了波斯语医疗推理能力。

Conclusion: 推理导向的训练方法在数据有限的情况下，能够高效开发领域特定的语言模型，证明了RLAIF和DPO在小数据集上的有效性。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了CreativityPrism框架，将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，用于全面评估大语言模型的创造力表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估方法碎片化，缺乏统一框架，主要由于对创造力的定义和测量标准不一致。

Method: CreativityPrism框架包含三个维度（质量、新颖性、多样性）、九个任务、三个领域（发散思维、创意写作、逻辑推理）和二十个评估指标。评估了17个最先进的专有和开源LLM。

Result: 专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距；同一领域内任务表现高度相关，不同领域间相关性较弱；多样性和质量指标强相关，新颖性与两者相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 创造力不同任务和维度之间的表现不具普遍性，需要采用整体性评估方法来全面衡量LLM的创造力。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

TL;DR: ARTER是一个无需深度微调的实体链接方法，通过自适应路由和选择性LLM推理，在保持高效率的同时实现高性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接方法依赖大量标注数据和模型微调，而现有的少样本方法虽然减少了训练需求，但LLM推理成本高昂且效率低下

Method: 采用结构化流水线，结合候选生成、基于上下文的评分、自适应路由和选择性推理，通过计算互补信号将上下文提及分为简单和困难案例，分别由低计算实体链接器和昂贵的LLM推理处理

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER比ReFinED性能提升高达4.47%，在6个数据集中的5个平均增益为2.53%，与全LLM推理流水线性能相当，但LLM token使用量减少一半

Conclusion: ARTER通过智能路由和选择性LLM推理，在实体链接任务中实现了性能与效率的良好平衡，为减少对大规模标注数据和昂贵LLM推理的依赖提供了可行方案

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: BoundRL是一种新颖高效的文本分割方法，通过联合执行token级文本分割和标签预测来处理复杂结构化文本，使用强化学习优化文档重建保真度和语义对齐，大幅降低推理成本并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本在技术报告、生成式AI提示等领域的复杂性增加，传统基于句子或段落的分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段和占位符等元素的文本，需要更有效的语义分割方法。

Method: BoundRL提出token级文本分割方法，只生成起始token序列并在原文本中定位来重建完整内容，使用带可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)优化文档重建保真度和语义对齐，并通过系统扰动生成序列构建中间候选来缓解熵崩溃。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL使小型语言模型(1.7B参数)在复杂LLM应用提示的分割任务上优于大型模型的少样本提示，RLVR相比监督微调带来显著改进，中间候选的加入进一步提升了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL为复杂结构化文本的分割提供了一种高效解决方案，通过创新的强化学习方法和中间候选策略，在保持高质量分割的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型从预训练数据中继承了刻板印象，导致在自然语言处理任务中对某些社会群体产生偏见行为，而立场检测方法中的这种偏见评估被社区严重忽视。

Method: 在零样本设置下，自动标注现有立场检测数据集中的帖子，使用两个属性：特定群体的方言或白话，以及文本复杂度/可读性，以研究这些属性是否影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: 结果显示LLMs在立场检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象，例如错误地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂度相关联，将非裔美国人方言与反对特朗普相关联。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在立场检测任务中存在显著的刻板印象偏见，需要进一步研究和缓解这些偏见。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Motivation: 当前搜索代理缺乏同时进行深度多跳推理和大规模信息收集的能力，这在现实应用（如市场分析和业务发展）中是一个关键缺陷。

Method: 通过转换现有数据集，构建了包含220个问题、涵盖15个不同领域的精选集合，要求代理处理大量数据并进行深度多跳检索推理。

Result: 实验表明，即使是最先进的代理在DeepWideSearch上的平均成功率仅为2.39%，揭示了深度和广度搜索整合的挑战性。错误分析识别了四种失败模式：缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文溢出。

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch基准测试公开发布，旨在推动未来开发更强大和鲁棒的信息搜索代理的研究。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：微调方法容易产生算术错误和幻觉，工具方法依赖刚性模式且缺乏语义理解。需要结合稳健推理和可靠表格处理的方法。

Conclusion: 结合结构化多智能体工作流和强化学习能够有效推进表格理解能力，展示了这种方法的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在文本输入上的空间推理能力，评估其在空间理解和计算能力方面的表现，揭示语言与空间推理之间的差距。

Method: 使用五个任务测试LLMs：象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和滑块移动，通过增加网格维度来扩展任务复杂度。

Result: LLMs在所有任务的小复杂度情况下表现中等，但随着规模增加性能急剧恶化，平均准确率损失42.7%，最高达84%。超过50%准确率的测试都至少损失48%准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs缺乏稳健的空间表示能力，语言与空间推理之间存在明显差距，为未来语言与几何交叉的集成基准测试奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解码无关的采样策略，用于高效计算语言模型对文本所有可能分词方式的概率边际化，避免了昂贵的生成步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估只考虑特定分词方式的概率，而忽略同一文本可能有多种分词方式。边际化评估虽然更准确，但传统采样方法需要昂贵的生成步骤，限制了采样数量和精度。

Method: 采用解码无关的采样策略，不依赖语言模型的生成过程，而是使用模型和分词器无关的廉价采样方法，仅需计算给定分词序列的概率。

Result: 实验表明，解码无关采样策略在多个开源模型上能够以极小的运行时间成本提供足够准确的边际概率估计，并在下游推理任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 解码无关采样策略是实现高效边际化评估的有效方法，能够在保持准确性的同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

Motivation: 抑郁和PTSD常共病且症状相关，但现有自动评估多为二元分类且针对单一障碍。临床需要能够提供严重程度分级、跨障碍评估和决策支持解释的诊断方法。

Method: 统一的三模态情感严重程度框架：同步融合访谈文本（句子级transformer嵌入）、音频（log Mel统计特征）和面部信号（动作单元、注视、头部姿态描述符），通过校准的后期融合分类器输出抑郁（PHQ-8；5类）和PTSD（3类）的严重程度分级。

Result: 在DAIC数据集上的分层交叉验证优于单模态/消融基线。融合模型在准确率和加权F1上与最强单模态基线相当，同时提高了决策曲线效用和在噪声或缺失模态下的鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合减少了回归误差并提高了类别一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感临床决策提供了可重复评估和临床医生在环支持，文本对抑郁严重程度贡献最大，音频和面部线索对PTSD至关重要，归因分析与语言和行为标记一致。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

TL;DR: ContextLM框架通过引入next-context prediction目标来增强标准预训练，克服了next-token prediction在捕捉高层次语义结构和长距离上下文关系方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的next-token预测方法限制了模型捕捉高层次语义结构和长距离上下文关系的能力，需要一种能够提升语言模型在这些方面表现的改进方法。

Method: 提出ContextLM框架，在标准预训练基础上增加next-context prediction目标，训练模型学习多token上下文的预测表示，利用未来token块的错误信号，同时保持与标准自回归评估范式的完全兼容。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型家族上的实验表明，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均带来一致改进，模型参数规模可达15亿。

Conclusion: next-context prediction为更强的语言建模提供了可扩展且高效的途径，能够以最小计算开销实现更好的长距离连贯性和更有效的注意力分配。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将RAG系统中的引用失败与回答失败区分开来，并开发了CITECONTROL基准来研究引用失败，同时提出了CITENTION框架来改善LLM的引用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based RAG系统的引用功能在验证回答时存在引用失败问题，即模型生成有帮助的回答但未能完整引用证据。需要将引用失败与回答失败区分开来，并找到解决方案。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 研究引用失败的发生条件，开发CITECONTROL基准分析回答与证据关系对引用质量的影响；2) 提出CITENTION框架，整合生成式、基于注意力和基于检索的方法来改善引用性能。

Result: 实验表明引用失败随关系复杂性增加而增加，结合多种引用方法可改善性能。CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL基准和迁移设置中都显著提升了引用质量。

Conclusion: 引用失败是一个独立于回答失败的重要问题，通过系统分析回答-证据关系和集成多种引用方法可以有效改善LLM的引用性能。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究过程奖励模型(PRMs)在表格问答(TQA)任务中的应用，发现PRMs在结合文本和代码验证时能帮助选择答案，但在跨域泛化方面存在困难，且步骤级验证与答案准确性之间相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRMs在数学等领域通过逐步骤评分来提升复杂推理能力，但在涉及半结构化数据的表格问答任务中的应用尚未探索。TQA面临无关信息多、推理步骤松散、领域特定推理等独特挑战。

Method: 评估最先进的生成式PRMs在TQA任务中的表现，从答案和步骤两个角度进行分析，结合文本和代码验证方法。

Result: PRMs结合文本和代码验证能帮助解决方案选择，但难以泛化到域外数据。步骤级验证性能与答案准确性之间相关性较弱，可能源于步骤依赖弱和因果联系松散。

Conclusion: 当前PRMs在TQA任务中存在局限性，研究结果为构建更鲁棒的过程感知验证器提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂数学运算中表现不佳，集成代码解释器时会产生内部概率推理与外部确定性知识之间的冲突，导致无效的思考过程。

Method: 提出Hint-Engineering数据合成策略，在推理路径的关键点注入多样化提示，生成高质量代码集成推理数据，并通过监督微调、拒绝采样和强化学习优化模型与代码解释器的多轮交互。

Result: 在五个挑战性数学推理数据集上，32B和1.5B模型分别获得4%和8%的绝对提升，同时显著提高效率，32B模型减少约30%token使用，1.5B模型减少约50%。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效解决了大型推理模型与代码解释器集成时的冲突问题，显著提升了数学推理性能和效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

TL;DR: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能部分源于对公开数据集的记忆而非真正的泛化能力，特别是在数据集包含强语义线索时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据上的推理能力时，往往忽略了数据集污染这一关键混杂因素，需要探究LLMs是否对广泛使用的表格基准数据集存在先验知识。

Method: 通过一系列受控探测实验，比较LLMs在包含语义线索的数据集与去除/随机化语义线索的数据集上的表现差异。

Result: 当数据集包含强语义线索时出现污染效应，而移除这些线索后性能急剧下降至接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现能力可能反映了对公开数据集的记忆而非真实推理能力，需要改进评估协议来区分语义泄漏与真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分块方法采用固定粒度范式，依赖静态边界识别，限制了其对多样化查询需求的适应性。

Method: 将句子作为原子单元，从静态分块分割转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，显著减少语义边界检测的计算开销。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验评估显示，FreeChunker相比传统分块方法实现了更优的检索性能，同时在计算效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker通过范式转变，从根本上改变了传统分块方法，实现了更好的适应性和效率。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 探究仅使用对话数据进行预训练是否能够产生在形式和功能上都适合的小型语言模型，以及如何通过微调策略使模型生成更具沟通性的文本。

Method: 基于对话数据预训练的llamalogue模型，采用多种微调策略（包括PPO和DPO）来增强模型的沟通能力生成。

Result: 模型在大多数标准BabyLM基准测试中表现不佳，但在最小配对设置中的对话延续预测方面表现出色；PPO微调效果混杂甚至有害，而DPO微调能进一步提升自定义对话基准的性能。

Conclusion: 对话专用预训练虽然限制了模型在通用基准上的表现，但能够产生在对话任务上表现优异的模型，DPO微调是提升对话性能的有效方法。

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves

Motivation: 研究否定文本对LLM幻觉的影响，探索LLM是否能识别否定引起的语境变化并可靠区分幻觉。

Method: 构建NegHalu数据集（通过否定表达式重构现有幻觉检测数据集），实验评估LLMs在否定文本中的幻觉检测能力，并进行token级内部状态分析。

Result: LLMs难以有效检测否定文本中的幻觉，经常产生逻辑不一致或不忠实的判断。

Conclusion: 否定文本对LLM幻觉检测构成显著挑战，需要专门的方法来缓解其不良影响。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

Motivation: 现有的BERT模型架构相对过时，需要采用更现代的transformer架构来提升性能，特别是针对希伯来语NLP任务。

Method: 采用与NeoBERT相同的架构，专门针对希伯来语文本进行训练，开发了单语和双语两个版本。

Result: 在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中超越现有模型，双语模型在检索任务上表现优于同规模的多语言模型。

Conclusion: 这些模型为希伯来语NLP的下游任务提供了强大基础，并已向社区发布以推动希伯来语NLP的研究和发展。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

Motivation: 儿童与照顾者之间的多轮对话具有连贯性特征，即对话者之间及时、直接且有意义的交流。研究旨在改进BabyLM在多轮对话中的连贯性表现。

Method: 使用教师-学生框架ContingentChat，基于新颖的对齐数据集进行后训练，并尝试自适应教师解码策略。

Result: BabyLM生成的回复在语法和连贯性方面有所改善，但自适应教师解码策略带来的额外增益有限。

Conclusion: 针对性后训练对提升对话质量有益，但连贯性仍然是BabyLM面临的挑战性目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

Method: 构建MIXTURE数据集（14.4万样本），提出LM-Mixup方法：先在MIXTURE上进行监督微调，然后使用GRPO强化学习优化，结合质量、语义对齐和格式合规三个奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用LM-Mixup蒸馏的3%数据就能超越全数据集训练效果，并与最先进的高质量数据选择方法相竞争。

Conclusion: 低质量数据经过适当蒸馏和LM-Mixup增强后是宝贵资源，能显著提升指令调优LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出存在不确定性和正确性差异，实际可靠性无法保证，需要量化这种不确定性以提高模型应用的可靠性。

Method: 在四个问答任务上使用最先进的开源LLM，系统评估四种置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、样本一致性和CoCoA。

Result: 每种不确定性指标捕捉了模型置信度的不同方面，混合方法CoCoA在整体可靠性方面表现最好，提高了校准和正确答案的区分能力。

Conclusion: 讨论了各种方法的权衡，并为LLM应用中选择不确定性度量提供了建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Conclusion: RECALL为演进大语言模型提供了一个可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，实现了无缝多领域集成和强大的抗遗忘能力。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

### [44] [Steering Evaluation-Aware Language Models To Act Like They Are Deployed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20487)
*Tim Tian Hua,Andrew Qin,Samuel Marks,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过向LLM的激活状态添加导向向量，可以抑制模型在评估时的警觉性，使其在评估环境中表现得像在部署环境中一样，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型有时能检测到它们正在被评估，并调整行为以显得更加对齐，这会损害安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 采用两步训练过程：首先在包含模型事实描述的文档上进行持续预训练，然后通过专家迭代训练模型在评估设置中使用Python类型提示。最后使用原始模型的激活状态构建导向向量来抑制评估警觉性。

Result: 训练后的模型在评估环境中比部署环境中更频繁地使用类型提示，但通过激活导向可以消除这种差异，使模型在有评估线索时也表现得像在部署中。

Conclusion: AI评估者可以通过导向技术使模型在评估时表现得像在部署中，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

### [45] [Robust Preference Alignment via Directional Neighborhood Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20498)
*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Robust Preference Selection (RPS)方法，通过方向性邻域共识来增强语言模型对多样化用户偏好的鲁棒性，无需重新训练即可提升模型在非主流偏好上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在训练数据中主要反映主流偏好，导致对特定、个性化需求的覆盖不足，形成偏好覆盖差距。传统方法需要昂贵的重新训练，且难以适应完整的偏好谱系。

Method: RPS是一种后处理、无需训练的方法，通过在相关偏好的局部邻域中采样多个响应来创建候选池，然后选择最符合用户原始意图的响应。

Result: 在三种不同对齐范式（DPA、DPO、SFT）上的全面实验表明，RPS始终比基线方法更鲁棒，在空间欠代表区域的挑战性偏好上达到高达69%的胜率。

Conclusion: RPS提供了一个实用且理论基础的解决方案，能够增强偏好对齐模型的可靠性，无需模型重新训练即可处理多样化用户偏好。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HSEQ迭代框架，通过层次化序列统一表示文本、表格和知识图谱，进行结构感知的迭代检索，在保持效率的同时提升多步问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在处理多步问题和异构证据源时存在脆弱性，需要在准确性、延迟和资源消耗之间权衡。

Method: 将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆的层次序列，通过头代理指导检索，迭代代理执行结构感知的扩展操作，最后合成规范化证据生成答案。

Result: 在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA等数据集上，相比现有方法在EM/F1指标上取得一致提升，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: HSEQ框架实现了格式无关的统一表示，支持预算感知的迭代检索，通过证据规范化提高了问答的可靠性和可审计性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估LLM政治偏见的新方法，通过分析欧洲议会演讲的多语言翻译质量差异，发现主流政党（左、中、右翼）的演讲比边缘政党的翻译质量更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上通过英语调查评估LLM政治偏见存在局限，本文旨在基于多语言翻译公平性原则，从翻译质量差异的角度系统分析LLM的政治偏见。

Method: 构建了一个包含政治派别信息的21种语言多平行语料库EuroParl，包含150万句子、4000万单词，覆盖3年数据、1000+发言人、7个国家、12个欧盟政党等，系统比较不同政党演讲的翻译质量。

Result: 研究发现主流政党（左翼、中间派、右翼）的演讲翻译质量显著优于边缘政党，揭示了LLM在翻译过程中存在的系统性政治偏见。

Conclusion: 基于多语言翻译公平性的框架能够有效揭示LLM的政治偏见，为评估和改进LLM的政治中立性提供了新视角和方法。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of
national parties.

*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ARC-Encoder，一种可适配的文本表示压缩器，通过将上下文压缩为连续表示来替代解码器LLM中的token嵌入，显著减少计算成本并保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成和思维链推理等技术导致上下文变长和推理成本增加，现有上下文压缩方法需要微调目标模型或修改架构，这会降低模型的通用能力。

Method: 系统研究编码器的训练策略和架构选择，设计ARC-Encoder，输出比文本token少4-8倍的连续表示，可适配多个解码器LLM。

Result: ARC-Encoder在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时提高推理计算效率，单个编码器可适配多个解码器LLM。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是一种灵活高效的便携式编码器解决方案，可与多个LLM无缝协作，显著减少推理成本。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Kaige Chen,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench是一个包含9720个理解问题的数据集，专门测试语言模型对中心嵌入句的结构理解能力，通过对比语义合理与不合理句子的表现差异来区分语法分析和语义模式匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法区分语言模型是真正理解语法结构还是仅仅依赖语义模式匹配，需要开发新方法来评估模型的结构分析能力。

Method: 创建CenterBench数据集，包含中心嵌入句及其语义不合理对照句，通过六种理解问题测试表面理解、句法依赖和因果推理能力，测试六个不同模型。

Result: 模型在语义合理与不合理句子间的性能差距随复杂度增加而系统性地扩大，最大差距达26.8个百分点，表明模型在复杂结构下会放弃结构分析而依赖语义关联。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了首个识别模型何时从结构分析转向模式匹配的框架，揭示了语义合理性在因果推理问题中反而会损害性能，推理模型虽然提高准确性但仍存在语义捷径等问题。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了GlobalRAG强化学习框架，通过分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理、迭代精炼证据来解决多跳问答中的全局规划缺失和不忠实执行问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在多跳问答中存在两个基本限制：(i) 缺乏全局规划来构建多步推理结构，(ii) 不忠实的执行阻碍了有效查询制定和检索证据的一致性使用。

Method: GlobalRAG框架包含问题分解为子目标、检索与推理协调、证据迭代精炼。引入规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励来指导过程，并采用渐进权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向目标。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，GlobalRAG显著优于强基线方法，仅使用8k训练数据（基线的42%），在EM和F1指标上平均提升14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过强化学习有效增强了多跳问答中的全局推理能力，在数据效率方面表现出色，显著提升了问答性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

TL;DR: 提出了多智能体认知决策框架（MACDF），将电商搜索从被动检索转变为主动决策支持，解决了传统检索排序范式与用户多阶段认知决策过程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电商搜索的检索排序范式依赖于查询-商品匹配，这与平台用户的多阶段认知决策过程存在根本性不匹配，导致复杂查询的语义鸿沟、跨平台信息搜寻的高决策成本以及缺乏专业购物指导等关键限制。

Method: 提出多智能体认知决策框架（MACDF），通过多智能体系统实现从被动检索到主动决策支持的范式转变。

Result: 离线评估显示MACDF在推荐准确性和用户满意度方面有显著提升，特别是在涉及否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询中。在JD搜索平台上的在线A/B测试证实了其实际效果。

Conclusion: 这项工作凸显了多智能体认知系统在重新定义电商搜索方面的变革潜力。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补ChatGPT等AI技术在通信数据编码中是否存在性别和种族偏见的空白，确保自动化评估的公平性。

Method: 使用典型的协作问题解决编码框架，分析三种协作任务（谈判、问题解决、决策制定）的数据，比较不同性别和种族群体的编码结果。

Result: ChatGPT基于的编码在性别和种族群体间未表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: ChatGPT的自动编码无显著人口统计学偏见，可安全用于大规模协作和通信评估。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

TL;DR: 本文基于人类好奇心评估问卷5DCR，构建了一个评估框架来测试大语言模型的好奇心水平，发现LLMs在知识渴求方面强于人类，但在不确定环境中倾向保守选择，且好奇行为能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型是否具备类似人类的好奇心驱动学习能力，从人类好奇心评估问卷出发设计评估框架。

Method: 基于五维好奇心量表修订版(5DCR)设计评估框架，涵盖信息寻求、刺激寻求、社交好奇心等维度，评估LLMs的好奇心表现。

Result: LLMs表现出比人类更强的知识渴求，但在面对不确定环境时倾向保守选择；好奇行为能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs具备展现类似人类好奇心的潜力，为未来LLMs学习能力和创新研究的发展提供了实验支持。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

Motivation: 探索大型推理模型的多语言推理能力，关注其在非英语问题中的推理模式及其对准确性和文化细微差别处理的影响。

Method: 在MGSM和GPQA Diamond任务上系统比较模型在英语与问题语言中的推理表现，分析推理轨迹中的认知属性。

Result: 英语推理轨迹显示出更高的认知行为存在度，且英语推理通常带来更高的最终答案准确率，但随着任务复杂度增加，这种策略容易因翻译错误而失败。

Conclusion: 虽然英语推理能提高准确率，但存在"翻译迷失"风险，需要在多语言推理中平衡准确性与语言适应性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了CantoNLU基准测试，涵盖粤语自然语言理解的7个任务，比较了不同模型的性能，发现粤语适应模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粤语虽然有数百万使用者，但由于政策和双语现象，资源仍然匮乏，缺乏评估框架。

Method: 创建CantoNLU基准测试，包含7个任务：词义消歧、语言可接受性判断、语言检测、自然语言推理、情感分析、词性标注和依存句法分析。比较了四种模型：未经粤语训练的普通话模型、通过持续预训练得到的两个粤语适应模型，以及从头训练的粤语单语模型。

Result: 粤语适应模型整体表现最佳，单语模型在句法任务上表现更好。普通话模型在某些场景下仍有竞争力，表明当粤语领域数据稀缺时，直接迁移可能足够。

Conclusion: 发布了所有数据集、代码和模型权重，以促进粤语自然语言处理的未来研究。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

TL;DR: 提出神经多样性作为减少语言模型幻觉的新机制，通过解相关的并行表示，在固定参数和数据预算下降低幻觉率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在参数、计算和数据增加的情况下仍然存在幻觉问题，需要寻找新的解决方案。

Method: 引入ND-LoRA（神经多样性低秩适应），结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，通过降低表示相关性来减少幻觉。

Result: ND-LoRA将幻觉率降低高达25.6%（平均14.6%），且不损害一般准确性。神经相关性增加0.1%与幻觉增加3.8%相关。

Conclusion: 神经多样性是继参数和数据之后的第三个扩展维度，可以在固定预算下提高语言模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

*Bryan Eikema,Anna Rutkiewicz,Mario Giulianelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种轻量级适配方法，通过改进MBR解码的效用函数来增强对结果空间结构变化的敏感性，在开放任务中显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MBR解码在机器翻译等任务中有效，但在对话或指令跟随等开放任务中，标准相似性效用函数可能选择模型分布中广泛代表性但结构上次优的响应。

Method: 提出三种轻量级效用函数适配方法，使MBR对结果空间的结构变化更敏感；构建包含对话行为、情感和响应结构的数据集；提出两个评估结构最优性的指标。

Result: 分析显示传统相似性效用函数在结构最优性指标上表现不佳，而提出的适配方法显著改善了结构最优性；在真实指令跟随基准测试中，结构敏感性提升使生成质量提高了13.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过增强MBR解码对结构变化的敏感性，可以显著提升开放任务中的生成质量，证明了结构感知效用函数的重要性。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

### [59] [User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20721)
*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 用户研究发现，在隐私敏感场景中，用户对LLM响应的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价存在很大差异，而代理LLM与用户评价相关性很低，表明隐私和帮助性感知具有个体特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖代理LLM评估隐私规范合规性，忽视了真实用户的感知，且只关注隐私保护质量而未研究帮助性的细微差异。

Method: 对94名参与者使用PrivacyLens中的90个场景进行用户研究，比较用户与5个代理LLM对相同响应的评价。

Result: 用户对相同场景的相同响应在隐私保护质量和帮助性上评价不一致，而代理LLM之间高度一致但与用户评价相关性低。

Conclusion: 隐私和帮助性感知具有个体特异性，代理LLM不能准确估计用户感知，需要进行以用户为中心的研究来改进对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发并评估了多种NLP方法从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，发现基于大语言模型的方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氟嘧啶类药物广泛用于结直肠癌和乳腺癌治疗，但会引起手足综合征和心脏毒性等不良反应，这些毒性信息通常嵌入在临床笔记中，需要有效提取方法。

Method: 构建了包含236份临床笔记的金标准数据集，开发了基于规则、机器学习（随机森林、SVM、逻辑回归）、深度学习（BERT、ClinicalBERT）和大语言模型（零样本和错误分析提示）的NLP方法。

Result: 错误分析提示方法在治疗和毒性提取方面达到最优性能（F1=1.000），零样本提示方法在治疗提取上F1=1.000，毒性提取F1=0.876。逻辑回归和SVM在毒性提取上排名第二（F1=0.937）。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的NLP方法最有效地从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，在肿瘤学研究和药物警戒方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统分析大型推理模型作为机器翻译评估器的潜力，发现其存在评估材料需求特殊、简单实例过度思考、评分机制导致高估等问题，并提出通过训练合成的人类思维轨迹来校准模型思考，显著降低思考成本并提升评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务中通过中间思考过程提升了推理能力，但其在机器翻译质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统分析其作为评估器的可行性。

Method: 提出校准大型推理模型思考的方法，通过训练模型学习合成的人类思维轨迹，解决过度思考和评分偏差问题，并在WMT24 Metrics基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明该方法将思考预算大幅降低约35倍，同时在不同规模模型（7B到32B）上提升评估性能，如R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型相关性提高了8.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 高效校准的大型推理模型具有推动细粒度自动机器翻译评估的潜力，通过优化思考过程可以显著提升评估效率和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估LLM的方法主要关注文本生成等高级任务，没有针对特定AI应用，无法充分评估负责任AI维度如公平性。

Method: 构建了一个由真实应用驱动的数据集（根据产品特征生成纯文本产品描述），通过公平属性与性别化形容词和产品类别的交叉参数化，产生带标签的提示集。

Result: 展示了如何使用该数据识别LLM在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性方面的差距。

Conclusion: 为研究社区贡献了LLM评估方案和具体资源，强调针对特定应用场景评估负责任AI维度的重要性。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力模型虽然高效，但有限的记忆容量会导致遗忘问题，影响检索密集型任务的表现。

Method: 提出混合模型，在线性注意力中插入稀疏注意力机制，包括token淘汰稀疏注意力和查询感知的本地稀疏注意力。特别提出可学习的token淘汰方法，结合滑动窗口注意力和轻量CNN，自适应保留关键KV对。

Result: 在检索密集型基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，并提供了高效的Triton内核实现。

Conclusion: 混合注意力模型在保持线性复杂度优势的同时，有效缓解了线性注意力的遗忘问题，提升了检索密集型任务的性能。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单高效的均值池化方法用于RAG中的软上下文压缩，在多个数据集和模型上表现优于广泛使用的压缩token架构，并研究了多压缩比训练的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低长上下文在检索增强生成(RAG)中的计算成本，通过软上下文压缩将输入序列转换为更短的连续表示。

Method: 开发轻量级简单的均值池化方法，训练相同的压缩器输出多个压缩比，并在多个QA数据集、模型家族、规模和压缩比上进行广泛实验。

Result: 简单的均值池化方法取得了最强的性能，多压缩比训练时性能下降相对较小，但不同架构和训练机制之间的权衡更加复杂。

Conclusion: 均值池化是有效的软上下文压缩方法，但压缩方法的整体格局复杂，需要更细致地考虑不同场景下的权衡。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合组合-连续框架来解决带区间距离的分子距离几何问题(iDMDGP)，结合离散枚举和连续优化来在距离不确定性下重建蛋白质三维结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在核磁共振等实际应用中，原子间距离通常只能获得不确定性区间，而非精确值，这导致需要处理区间距离的分子距离几何问题(iDMDGP)。现有方法大多假设窄距离区间，难以处理宽区间情况。

Method: 结合离散枚举过程和连续优化阶段：使用DMDGP的枚举方法探索搜索空间，然后通过最小化非凸应力函数进行连续精化，该函数惩罚与可接受距离区间的偏差。方法还整合了扭转角区间和手性约束。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法即使在宽距离区间下也能有效重建几何有效的构象，而现有研究大多假设窄区间。

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架能够系统性地探索离散结构并利用局部优化，在距离不确定性条件下成功重建蛋白质三维结构。

Abstract: The Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (MDGP) is essential in structural
biology, as it seeks to determine three-dimensional protein structures from
partial interatomic distances. Its discretizable subclass (DMDGP) admits an
exact combinatorial formulation that enables efficient exploration of the
search space. However, in practical settings such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy, distances are available only within uncertainty bounds,
leading to the interval variant (\emph{i}DMDGP). We propose a hybrid
combinatorial--continuous framework for solving the \emph{i}DMDGP. The method
combines an enumeration process derived from the DMDGP with a continuous
refinement stage that minimizes a nonconvex stress function that penalizes
deviations from admissible distance intervals. This integration supports a
systematic exploration guided by discrete structure and local optimization. The
formulation incorporates torsion-angle intervals and chirality constraints
through a refined atom ordering that preserves protein-backbone geometry.
Numerical experiments show that the approach efficiently reconstructs
geometrically valid conformations even under wide distance bounds, whereas most
existing studies assume narrow ones.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用神经算子学习线性二次平均场博弈中的规则到均衡映射，通过少量随机采样规则训练后能可靠解决未见过的LQ MFG变体，即使在无限维设置下也有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MFG求解器逐个实例处理，在处理大量相关问题时变得不可行。需要一种方法能够学习从问题数据到均衡策略的映射，以应对动态或效用扰动等情况。

Method: 训练神经算子学习LQ MFGs中从动态和成本函数（规则）到对应均衡策略的映射，通过随机采样规则进行训练，并控制神经算子的Lipschitz正则性。

Result: 证明了统计保证：在少量随机采样规则上训练的神经算子能够可靠解决未见过的LQ MFG变体，即使在无限维设置下，所需参数数量在适当规则采样下保持可控。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合局部Lipschitz估计、具有预设Lipschitz正则性的通用逼近定理以及无限维空间中L-Lipschitz学习者的样本复杂度界限，为LQ MFGs提供了有效的求解框架。

Abstract: Traditional mean-field game (MFG) solvers operate on an instance-by-instance
basis, which becomes infeasible when many related problems must be solved
(e.g., for seeking a robust description of the solution under perturbations of
the dynamics or utilities, or in settings involving continuum-parameterized
agents.). We overcome this by training neural operators (NOs) to learn the
rules-to-equilibrium map from the problem data (``rules'': dynamics and cost
functionals) of LQ MFGs defined on separable Hilbert spaces to the
corresponding equilibrium strategy. Our main result is a statistical guarantee:
an NO trained on a small number of randomly sampled rules reliably solves
unseen LQ MFG variants, even in infinite-dimensional settings. The number of NO
parameters needed remains controlled under appropriate rule sampling during
training.
  Our guarantee follows from three results: (i) local-Lipschitz estimates for
the highly nonlinear rules-to-equilibrium map; (ii) a universal approximation
theorem using NOs with a prespecified Lipschitz regularity (unlike traditional
NO results where the NO's Lipschitz constant can diverge as the approximation
error vanishes); and (iii) new sample-complexity bounds for $L$-Lipschitz
learners in infinite dimensions, directly applicable as the Lipschitz constants
of our approximating NOs are controlled in (ii).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在评估组织效率时通常单独评估各维度后再聚合，无法有效捕捉输入输出变量间的相关性，需要开发能同时处理多维度效率和期望/非期望产出的综合方法。

Method: 引入两种正则化DEA模型：SBM模型先估计总体效率再分配到各维度，GP-SBM模型先估计维度级效率再推导总体效率。两种模型都使用正则化参数增强区分能力，并直接整合期望和非期望产出。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法的计算效率和有效性，应用于加拿大安大略省12家医院的案例研究，评估技术效率、临床效率和患者体验三个维度。结果显示SBM和GP-SBM能更好地捕捉变量相关性，优于传统的先单独评估再聚合的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的动态多维度DEA方法能够更准确地评估组织效率，特别是当存在期望和非期望产出以及维度间相关性时，为大规模组织效率评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We propose an approach for dynamic efficiency evaluation across multiple
organizational dimensions using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The method
generates both dimension-specific and aggregate efficiency scores, incorporates
desirable and undesirable outputs, and is suitable for large-scale problem
settings. Two regularized DEA models are introduced: a slack-based measure
(SBM) and a linearized version of a nonlinear goal programming model (GP-SBM).
While SBM estimates an aggregate efficiency score and then distributes it
across dimensions, GP-SBM first estimates dimension-level efficiencies and then
derives an aggregate score. Both models utilize a regularization parameter to
enhance discriminatory power while also directly integrating both desirable and
undesirable outputs. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and validity
of our approach on multiple datasets and apply it to a case study of twelve
hospitals in Ontario, Canada, evaluating three theoretically grounded
dimensions of organizational effectiveness over a 24-month period from January
2018 to December 2019: technical efficiency, clinical efficiency, and patient
experience. Our numerical results show that SBM and GP-SBM better capture
correlations among input/output variables and outperform conventional
benchmarking methods that separately evaluate dimensions before aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力系统运营商面临各种离散操作决策，将这些决策纳入最优潮流问题会产生混合整数非线性规划问题，目前无法在所需时间内大规模求解。现有的线性化方法（如DC-OPF）在某些边缘情况下会产生非常差的整数解，难以在控制室中应用。

Method: 采用建模生成替代方案（MGA）方法，为线性化问题寻找替代解，降低找不到AC可行解的概率。通过测试13个网络验证该方法有效性。

Result: 在13个测试网络中，DC线性化导致不可行整数决策的情况下，MGA方法在所有案例中都找到了解。MGA搜索标准的选择显著影响找到解的数量和质量。

Conclusion: MGA方法能有效解决DC线性化产生的不可行解问题，但需要针对特定网络设计搜索函数以获得更好的解质量。

Abstract: Transmission system operators face a variety of discrete operational
decisions, such as switching of branches and/or devices. Incorporating these
decisions into optimal power flow (OPF) results in mixed-integer non-linear
programming problems (MINLPs), which can't presently be solved at scale in the
required time. Various linearizations of the OPF exist, most famously the
DC-OPF, which can be leveraged to find integer decisions. However, these
linearizations can yield very poor integer solutions in some edge cases, making
them challenging to incorporate into control rooms. This paper introduces the
use of modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) to find alternative solutions to
the linearized problems, reducing the chance of finding no AC feasible
solutions. We test this approach using 13 networks where the DC linearization
results in infeasible integer decisions, and MGA finds a solution in all cases.
The MGA search criteria selected drastically affects the number and quality of
solutions found, so network specific search functions may be necessary.

Abstract: A Graph of Convex Sets (GCS) is a graph in which vertices are associated with
convex programs and edges couple pairs of programs through additional convex
costs and constraints. Any optimization problem over an ordinary weighted graph
(e.g., the shortest-path, the traveling-salesman, and the minimum-spanning-tree
problems) can be naturally generalized to a GCS, yielding a new class of
problems at the interface of combinatorial and convex optimization with
numerous applications. In this paper, we introduce a unified method for solving
any such problem. Starting from an integer linear program that models an
optimization problem over a weighted graph, our method automatically produces
an efficient mixed-integer convex formulation of the corresponding GCS problem.
This formulation is based on homogenization (perspective) transformations, and
the resulting program is solved to global optimality using off-the-shelf
branch-and-bound solvers. We implement this framework in GCSOPT, an open-source
and easy-to-use Python library designed for fast prototyping. We illustrate the
versatility and scalability of our approach through multiple numerical examples
and comparisons.

sensor displacement uncertainty, we introduce the radius of robust feasibility
(RRF) as a measure of tolerance against positional perturbations. We formulate
an exact expression for the RRF of aerial sensor networks and embed it into the
coverage maximization model as a robustness constraint. Our approach guarantees
that the optimized configuration remains feasible under bounded uncertainty. A
distributed greedy algorithm based on Voronoi partitioning is used for
orientation adjustment, ensuring scalable and adaptive deployment toward
high-impact regions. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
model in preserving robust coverage across complex terrain and varying
uncertainty conditions.

Result: 证明了诱导算子的平均性、收缩性和指数稳定性，建立了Fejer单调性、漂移感知收敛性和连续时间等价性。

Conclusion: BVLD框架为时变环境下的算子动力学提供了严格的分析基础，统一了多种学习算法并保证了稳定性。

Abstract: We develop a general optimization-theoretic framework for Bregman-Variational
Learning Dynamics (BVLD), a new class of operator-based updates that unify
Bayesian inference, mirror descent, and proximal learning under time-varying
environments. Each update is formulated as a variational optimization problem
combining a smooth convex loss f_t with a Bregman divergence D_psi. We prove
that the induced operator is averaged, contractive, and exponentially stable in
the Bregman geometry. Further, we establish Fejer monotonicity, drift-aware
convergence, and continuous-time equivalence via an evolution variational
inequality (EVI). Together, these results provide a rigorous analytical
foundation for well-posed and stability-guaranteed operator dynamics in
nonstationary optimization.

Motivation: 标准分布式梯度下降在非凸优化中容易陷入鞍点，需要设计能逃离鞍点的分布式算法。

Method: 在固定步长的分布式梯度下降迭代中，对每个智能体的局部梯度项添加随机扰动，使用小步长和小噪声方差。

Result: 在适当条件下，每个智能体以高概率收敛到共同二阶稳定点的指定半径邻域，收敛速率与集中式一阶算法相当。

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了该方法在非凸设置下优于标准分布式梯度下降，能有效逃离鞍点并收敛到局部极小值点。

Abstract: A variant of consensus based distributed gradient descent (\textbf{DGD}) is
studied for finite sums of smooth but possibly non-convex functions. In
particular, the local gradient term in the fixed step-size iteration of each
agent is randomly perturbed to evade saddle points. Under regularity
conditions, it is established that for sufficiently small step size and noise
variance, each agent converges with high probability to a specified radius
neighborhood of a common second-order stationary point, i.e., local minimizer.
The rate of convergence is shown to be comparable to centralized first-order
algorithms. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the efficacy of the
proposed approach over standard \textbf{DGD} in a non-convex setting.

Abstract: We analyze the identifiability of nonlinear networks with node dynamics
characterized by functions that are non-additive. We consider the full
measurement case (all the nodes are measured) in the path-independent delay
scenario where all the excitation signals of a specific node have the same
delay in the output of a measured node. Based on the notion of a generic
nonlinear matrix associated with the network, we introduce the concept of
generic identifiability and characterize the space of functions that satisfies
this property. For directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) characterized by analytic
functions, we derive a sufficient condition for identifiability based on
vertex-disjoint paths from excited nodes to the in-neighbors of each node in
the network. Furthermore, when we consider the class of polynomial functions,
by using well-known results on algebraic varieties, we prove that the
vertex-disjoint path condition is also necessary. Finally, we show that this
identifiability condition is not necessary for the additive nonlinear model.
Some examples are added to illustrate the results.

Abstract: Rail is a cost-effective and relatively low-emission mode for transporting
intermodal containers over long distances. This paper addresses tactical
planning of intermodal railroad operations by introducing a new problem that
simultaneously considers three consolidation processes and the management of a
heterogeneous railcar fleet. We model the problem with a scheduled service
network design with resource management (SSND-RM) formulation, expressed as an
integer linear program. While such formulations are challenging to solve at
scale, we demonstrate that our problem can be tackled with a general-purpose
solver when provided with high-quality warm-start solutions. To this end, we
design a construction heuristic inspired by a relax-and-fix procedure. We
evaluate the methodology on realistic, large-scale instances from our
industrial partner, the Canadian National Railway Company: a North American
Class I railroad. The computational experiments show that the proposed approach
efficiently solves practically relevant instances, and that solutions to the
SSND-RM formulation yield substantially more accurate capacity estimations
compared to those obtained from simpler baseline models. Managerial insights
from our study highlight that ignoring railcar fleet management or container
loading constraints can lead to a severe underestimation of required capacity,
which may result in costly operational inefficiencies. Furthermore, our results
show that the use of multi-platform railcars improves overall capacity
utilization and benefits the network, even if they can locally lead to less
efficient loading as measured by terminal-level slot utilization performance
indicators.

Motivation: 双层规划在经济学和工程中有广泛应用，但当存在多个下层解时问题定义不明确。现有方法通常限制下层问题以避免非唯一性，但这在许多情况下不可行。集合值公式化方法已被提出但研究有限，本文旨在研究一般情况下的各种解概念之间的联系。

Abstract: Bilevel programming is one of the very active areas of research with many
real-life applications in economics and engineering. Bilevel problems are
hierarchical problems consisting of lower-level and upper-level problems,
respectively. The leader or the decision-maker for the upper-level problem
decides first, and then the follower or the lower-level decision-maker chooses
his/her strategy. In the case of multiple lower-level solutions, the bilevel
problems are not well defined, and there are many ways to handle such a
situation. One standard way is to put restrictions on the lower level problems
(like strict convexity) so that nonuniqueness does not arise. However, those
restrictions are not viable in many situations. Therefore, there are two
standard formulations, called pessimistic formulations and optimistic
formulations of the upper-level problem. A set-valued formulation has been
proposed and has been studied in the literature. However, the study is limited
to the continuous set-up with the assumption of value attainment, and the
general case has not been considered. In this paper, we focus on the general
case and study the connection among various notions of solution. Our main
findings suggest that the set-valued formulation may not hold any bigger
advantage than the existing optimistic and pessimistic formulation.

Result: 对于某些QCQP问题，极端强分支规则优于现有商业求解器

Conclusion: 该方法成功将强分支概念扩展到非线性问题，同时利用边界收紧作为副产品

Abstract: For mixed-integer programs (MIPs), strong branching is a highly effective
variable selection method to reduce the number of nodes in the branch-and-bound
algorithm. Extending it to nonlinear problems is conceptually simple but
practically limited. Branching on a binary variable fixes the variable to 0 or
1, whereas branching on a continuous variable requires an additional decision
to choose a branching point. Previous extensions of strong branching predefine
this point and then solve $2n$ relaxations where $n$ is the number of candidate
variables to branch. We propose extreme strong branching, which evaluates
multiple branching points per variable and jointly selects both the branching
variable and point based on the objective value improvement. This approach
resembles the success of strong branching for MIPs while additionally
exploiting bound tightening as a byproduct. For certain types of quadratically
constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs), computational experiments show that the
extreme strong branching rule outperforms existing commercial solvers.

Conclusion: 各向同性噪声假设为高维随机优化提供了更现实的模型，所提算法显著提升了效率，量子各向同性化器为量子优化算法提供了新工具，整体推动了随机凸优化理论的发展。

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a $d$-dimensional Lipschitz convex
function using a stochastic gradient oracle. We introduce and motivate a
setting where the noise of the stochastic gradient is isotropic in that it is
bounded in every direction with high probability. We then develop an algorithm
for this setting which improves upon prior results by a factor of $d$ in
certain regimes, and as a corollary, achieves a new state-of-the-art complexity
for sub-exponential noise. We give matching lower bounds (up to polylogarithmic
factors) for both results. Additionally, we develop an efficient quantum
isotropifier, a quantum algorithm which converts a variance-bounded quantum
sampling oracle into one that outputs an unbiased estimate with isotropic
error. Combining our results, we obtain improved dimension-dependent rates for
quantum stochastic convex optimization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的非凸函数临界点优化方法，在梯度计算和Hessian计算次数之间提供了新的权衡。该方法能够在有限次Hessian查询下，以更少的梯度查询找到ε-临界点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的非凸优化方法在梯度查询和Hessian查询之间存在效率瓶颈。本文旨在开发新的优化方法，在保持收敛性的同时，减少梯度查询次数，特别是在有限Hessian计算资源的情况下。

Method: 开发了一种通用的优化算法，能够处理近似Hessian计算。该方法对于具有L2-Lipschitz Hessian的二次可微函数，通过精心设计的查询策略，在给定Hessian查询次数n_H下，实现梯度查询复杂度的优化。

Result: 获得了改进的梯度查询复杂度：在有限维度情况下为Õ(d^{1/3}L_2^{1/2}Δε^{-3/2})，在仅允许单次Hessian查询情况下为Õ(L_2^{3/4}Δ^{3/2}ε^{-9/4})。同时恢复了现有最优边界O(L_1^{1/2}L_2^{1/4}Δε^{-7/4})。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在非凸优化中实现了梯度查询和Hessian查询之间的新权衡，显著降低了梯度查询复杂度，特别是在Hessian计算资源受限的情况下，为大规模非凸优化问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We develop optimization methods which offer new trade-offs between the number
of gradient and Hessian computations needed to compute the critical point of a
non-convex function. We provide a method that for any twice-differentiable
$f\colon \mathbb R^d \rightarrow \mathbb R$ with $L_2$-Lipschitz Hessian, input
initial point with $\Delta$-bounded sub-optimality, and sufficiently small
$\epsilon > 0$, outputs an $\epsilon$-critical point, i.e., a point $x$ such
that $\|\nabla f(x)\| \leq \epsilon$, using $\tilde{O}(L_2^{1/4}
n_H^{-1/2}\Delta\epsilon^{-9/4})$ queries to a gradient oracle and $n_H$
queries to a Hessian oracle for any positive integer $n_H$. As a consequence,
we obtain an improved gradient query complexity of
$\tilde{O}(d^{1/3}L_2^{1/2}\Delta\epsilon^{-3/2})$ in the case of bounded
dimension and of $\tilde{O}(L_2^{3/4}\Delta^{3/2}\epsilon^{-9/4})$ in the case
where we are allowed only a \emph{single} Hessian query. We obtain these
results through a more general algorithm which can handle approximate Hessian
computations and recovers the state-of-the-art bound of computing an
$\epsilon$-critical point with $O(L_1^{1/2}L_2^{1/4}\Delta\epsilon^{-7/4})$
  gradient queries provided that $f$ also has an $L_1$-Lipschitz gradient.

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强型循环坐标下降(ECCD)框架，用于求解具有弹性网络约束的广义线性模型，相比现有方法减少了训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有坐标下降方法在梯度计算中存在非线性操作，导致训练效率不高。本文旨在通过改进坐标下降方法，避免非线性操作，提高计算效率。

Method: 通过在当前迭代点进行泰勒展开来重新设计CD方法，避免梯度计算中的非线性操作。引入近似后，能够展开CD方法中的向量递归，将计算重新表述为更高效的批处理计算。使用可调参数s控制展开程度。

Result: 实验表明，当s>1时能获得性能提升而不影响收敛，s=1时恢复原始CD方法。与现有最优求解器相比，在正则化路径变体上平均实现了3倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: ECCD方法避免了块坐标下降的收敛延迟和数值不稳定问题，在多个基准数据集上表现出显著的计算效率提升。

Abstract: We present a novel enhanced cyclic coordinate descent (ECCD) framework for
solving generalized linear models with elastic net constraints that reduces
training time in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods. We redesign
the CD method by performing a Taylor expansion around the current iterate to
avoid nonlinear operations arising in the gradient computation. By introducing
this approximation, we are able to unroll the vector recurrences occurring in
the CD method and reformulate the resulting computations into more efficient
batched computations. We show empirically that the recurrence can be unrolled
by a tunable integer parameter, $s$, such that $s > 1$ yields performance
improvements without affecting convergence, whereas $s = 1$ yields the original
CD method. A key advantage of ECCD is that it avoids the convergence delay and
numerical instability exhibited by block coordinate descent. Finally, we
implement our proposed method in C++ using Eigen to accelerate linear algebra
computations. Comparison of our method against existing state-of-the-art
solvers shows consistent performance improvements of $3\times$ in average for
regularization path variant on diverse benchmark datasets. Our implementation
is available at https://github.com/Yixiao-Wang-Stats/ECCD.

Method: 使用组合扩散方法，仅在解耦PDE数据上训练扩散模型，在推理时组合恢复耦合场。比较了基线扩散模型与v参数化策略，并引入了基于欧拉方案的对称组合方案。

Result: 尽管只看到解耦训练数据，组合扩散模型能以低误差恢复耦合轨迹。v参数化能提高基线扩散模型的准确性，但神经算子代理模型在耦合数据训练下表现最强。

Conclusion: 组合扩散是高效建模长时间尺度耦合PDE的可行策略，为减少数据需求提供了新途径。

Abstract: Simulating coupled PDE systems is computationally intensive, and prior
efforts have largely focused on training surrogates on the joint (coupled)
data, which requires a large amount of data. In the paper, we study
compositional diffusion approaches where diffusion models are only trained on
the decoupled PDE data and are composed at inference time to recover the
coupled field. Specifically, we investigate whether the compositional strategy
can be feasible under long time horizons involving a large number of time
steps. In addition, we compare a baseline diffusion model with that trained
using the v-parameterization strategy. We also introduce a symmetric
compositional scheme for the coupled fields based on the Euler scheme. We
evaluate on Reaction-Diffusion and modified Burgers with longer time grids, and
benchmark against a Fourier Neural Operator trained on coupled data. Despite
seeing only decoupled training data, the compositional diffusion models recover
coupled trajectories with low error. v-parameterization can improve accuracy
over a baseline diffusion model, while the neural operator surrogate remains
strongest given that it is trained on the coupled data. These results show that
compositional diffusion is a viable strategy towards efficient, long-horizon
modeling of coupled PDEs.

Abstract: Expectile regression neural networks (ERNNs) are powerful tools for capturing
heterogeneity and complex nonlinear structures in data. However, most existing
research has primarily focused on fully observed data, with limited attention
paid to scenarios involving censored observations. In this paper, we propose a
data augmentation based ERNNs algorithm, termed DAERNN, for modeling
heterogeneous censored data. The proposed DAERNN is fully data driven, requires
minimal assumptions, and offers substantial flexibility. Simulation studies and
real data applications demonstrate that DAERNN outperforms existing censored
ERNNs methods and achieves predictive performance comparable to models trained
on fully observed data. Moreover, the algorithm provides a unified framework
for handling various censoring mechanisms without requiring explicit parametric
model specification, thereby enhancing its applicability to practical censored
data analysis.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为评估最具影响力数据集的统计显著性提供了理论基础和实用工具，能够更可靠地识别数据中的真实问题。

Abstract: Small subsets of data with disproportionate influence on model outcomes can
have dramatic impacts on conclusions, with a few data points sometimes
overturning key findings. While recent work has developed methods to identify
these \emph{most influential sets}, no formal theory exists to determine when
their influence reflects genuine problems rather than natural sampling
variation. We address this gap by developing a principled framework for
assessing the statistical significance of most influential sets. Our
theoretical results characterize the extreme value distributions of maximal
influence and enable rigorous hypothesis tests for excessive influence,
replacing current ad-hoc sensitivity checks. We demonstrate the practical value
of our approach through applications across economics, biology, and machine
learning benchmarks.

Abstract: We present a fully decentralized routing framework for multi-robot
exploration missions operating under the constraints of a Lunar Delay-Tolerant
Network (LDTN). In this setting, autonomous rovers must relay collected data to
a lander under intermittent connectivity and unknown mobility patterns. We
formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Problem (POMDP)

leading strategy for addressing imbalanced classification problems. Despite the
success of this approach in practice, its theoretical foundations remain
underexplored. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the behavior of
SMOTE and related methods when classifiers are trained on synthetic data. We
first derive a uniform concentration bound on the discrepancy between the
empirical risk over synthetic minority samples and the population risk on the
true minority distribution. We then provide a nonparametric excess risk
guarantee for kernel-based classifiers trained using such synthetic data. These
results lead to practical guidelines for better parameter tuning of both SMOTE
and the downstream learning algorithm. Numerical experiments are provided to
illustrate and support the theoretical findings

### [87] [Diffusion Autoencoders with Perceivers for Long, Irregular and Multimodal Astronomical Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20595)
*Yunyi Shen,Alexander Gagliano*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出Diffusion Autoencoder with Perceivers (daep)框架，用于处理不规则、多模态序列数据的表示学习，在科学领域数据上优于VAE和maep基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习主要验证于规则采样数据（如图像、音频），但科学领域数据通常为不规则、多模态序列，需要专门架构来处理这种异构数据。

Method: 使用Perceiver编码器对异构测量进行标记化和压缩，采用Perceiver-IO扩散解码器进行重建，实现可扩展学习。同时建立maep作为强基线。

Result: 在多种光谱和光度天文数据集上，daep比VAE和maep基线获得更低重建误差、更具区分性的潜在空间，并更好保留精细结构。

Conclusion: daep是处理不规则、异构序列数据的有效框架，特别适用于科学领域。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become a central strategy for representation
learning, but the majority of architectures used for encoding data have only
been validated on regularly-sampled inputs such as images, audios. and videos.
In many scientific domains, data instead arrive as long, irregular, and
multimodal sequences. To extract semantic information from these data, we
introduce the Diffusion Autoencoder with Perceivers (daep). daep tokenizes
heterogeneous measurements, compresses them with a Perceiver encoder, and
reconstructs them with a Perceiver-IO diffusion decoder, enabling scalable
learning in diverse data settings. To benchmark the daep architecture, we adapt
the masked autoencoder to a Perceiver encoder/decoder design, and establish a
strong baseline (maep) in the same architectural family as daep. Across diverse
spectroscopic and photometric astronomical datasets, daep achieves lower
reconstruction errors, produces more discriminative latent spaces, and better
preserves fine-scale structure than both VAE and maep baselines. These results
establish daep as an effective framework for scientific domains where data
arrives as irregular, heterogeneous sequences.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，从业者面临更多无需重新训练即可提升推理时性能的方法选择，但这些方法在准确性、成本和延迟之间产生了复杂的权衡关系，且在不同领域中的表现尚不明确。

Method: 在数学推理和翻译任务上系统比较自反思和预算调优方法，评估包括Anthropic Claude、Amazon Nova和Mistral等主流LLM家族，在不同反思深度和计算预算下推导帕累托最优性能边界。

Result: 自反思效果存在显著的领域依赖性，在数学推理中性能提升可达220%。反思轮次深度和反馈机制质量对不同模型家族的性能影响各异。在Zalando Lounge部署的自反思增强营销内容本地化系统显示了市场依赖的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在部署这些技术时进行领域特定评估的重要性，并为在特定领域和资源约束下选择最优推理策略提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, practitioners face
increasing options for enhancing inference-time performance without model
retraining, including budget tuning and multi-step techniques like
self-reflection. While these methods improve output quality, they create
complex trade-offs among accuracy, cost, and latency that remain poorly
understood across different domains. This paper systematically compares
self-reflection and budget tuning across mathematical reasoning and translation
tasks. We evaluate prominent LLMs, including Anthropic Claude, Amazon Nova, and
Mistral families, along with other models under varying reflection depths and
compute budgets to derive Pareto optimal performance frontiers. Our analysis
reveals substantial domain dependent variation in self-reflection
effectiveness, with performance gains up to 220\% in mathematical reasoning. We
further investigate how reflection round depth and feedback mechanism quality
influence performance across model families. To validate our findings in a
real-world setting, we deploy a self-reflection enhanced marketing content
localisation system at Lounge by Zalando, where it shows market-dependent
effectiveness, reinforcing the importance of domain specific evaluation when
deploying these techniques. Our results provide actionable guidance for
selecting optimal inference strategies given specific domains and resource
constraints. We open source our self-reflection implementation for
reproducibility at

### [89] [Multivariate Variance Swap Using Generalized Variance Method for Stochastic Volatility models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20047)
*Semere Gebresilassie,Mulue Gebreslasie,Minglian Lin*

Main category: q-fin.MF

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个新颖的多资产投资组合方差互换建模框架，使用协方差矩阵行列式的广义方差方法，在Heston和BNS随机波动率模型下推导出已实现方差的闭式解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方差互换模型主要针对单一资产，缺乏对多资产投资组合的有效建模方法，需要开发能够处理多资产协方差结构的广义方差框架。

Method: 采用广义方差方法，利用基础资产协方差矩阵的行列式，在Heston和BNS随机波动率框架下指定对数收益分布，推导多资产协方差泛化的闭式解。

Result: 获得了三资产投资组合在Heston和BNS模型下的多元方差互换解析表达式，通过参数测试、校准和验证的数值实验证明了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的广义方差框架成功解决了多资产投资组合方差互换的建模问题，为多资产风险管理提供了有效的分析工具。

Abstract: This paper develops a novel framework for modeling the variance swap of
multi-asset portfolios by employing the generalized variance approach, which
utilizes the determinant of the covariance matrix of the underlying assets. By
specifying the distribution of the log returns of the underlying assets under
the Heston and Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (BNS) stochastic volatility
frameworks, we derive closed-form solutions for the realized variance through
the computation of the covariance generalization of multi-assets. To evaluate
the robustness of the proposed model, we conduct simulations using nine
different assets generated via the quantmod package. For a three-asset
portfolio, analytical expressions for the multivariate variance swap are
obtained under both the Heston and BNS models. Numerical experiments further
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through parameter testing,
calibration, and validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基于排名模型的消费-投资问题，这类模型具有系数不连续的特性，需要特殊的数学处理方法。

Method: 推导了带诺伊曼边界条件的HJB方程并证明验证定理，针对一阶模型（排名收益具有恒定漂移和扩散系数）给出了显式解。

Result: 在三种约束情况下（无约束、开放市场约束、完全投资市场）都得到了显式最优策略，这些策略与Merton问题的经典解相关。

Conclusion: 尽管基于排名模型的系数不连续性带来了挑战，但通过特殊方法成功解决了这类非标准控制问题，并在一阶模型中获得了显式解。

Abstract: We study a consumption-investment problem in a multi-asset market where the
returns follow a generic rank-based model. Our main result derives an HJB
equation with Neumann boundary conditions for the value function and proves a
corresponding verification theorem. The control problem is nonstandard due to
the discontinuous nature of the coefficients in rank-based models, requiring a
bespoke approach of independent mathematical interest. The special case of
first-order models, prescribing constant drift and diffusion coefficients for
the ranked returns, admits explicit solutions when the investor is either (a)
unconstrained, (b) abides by open market constraints or (c) is fully invested
in the market. The explicit optimal strategies in all cases are related to the
celebrated solution to Merton's problem, despite the intractability of
constraint (b) in that setting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种量子启发算法，使用矩阵乘积态和离散驱动调度解决QUBO问题，在数独和MaxCut问题上表现出色，能可靠找到全局最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二次无约束二进制优化问题，该问题在数学上等价于寻找伊辛自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态，需要高效算法来处理工业规模的应用。

Method: 使用矩阵乘积态紧凑表示自旋构型的大叠加，结合离散驱动调度引导MPS向基态演化，通过DMRG方法迭代最小化系统能量。

Result: 算法在数独谜题和MaxCut问题上表现优异，成功处理了200多个自旋的数独问题和251节点、3265边的MaxCut实例，可靠找到全局最小值。

Conclusion: 该量子启发方法具有可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业规模QUBO应用的优势，为复杂优化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了分析可靠性基准（ARB），这是首个用于量化能源系统分析中大型语言模型推理可靠性的标准化框架，包含五个子指标，并在确定性、概率性和认知性场景下评估了四个前沿模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前能源领域AI系统验证主要关注预测准确性或计算效率，缺乏对分析结论逻辑完整性的标准化测试框架。

Method: 开发了ARB框架，整合准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性纪律、政策一致性和透明度五个子指标，使用开放技术经济数据集在三种场景下评估GPT-4/5、Claude 4.5 Sonnet、Gemini 2.5 Pro和Llama 3 70B四个模型。

Result: GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet达到一致且符合政策的推理（分析可靠性指数>90），Gemini 2.5 Pro表现中等，Llama 3 70B低于专业阈值，统计验证显示这些差异显著且可重现。

Conclusion: ARB建立了能源文献中首个验证AI系统因果、概率和政策驱动推理的定量方法，为全球能源转型中的可信透明分析应用提供了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM网页代理方法在推理深度和效率上存在局限：线性方法无法进行多步推理且缺乏有效回溯，其他搜索策略则粒度粗且计算成本高。

Method: 采用显式子任务管理和树状结构探索实现可控多分支推理；通过网页状态重放和后台推理引导探索；利用页面动作记忆在会话内外共享已探索动作。

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，任务成功率达到35.8%，执行时间相比最先进方法减少高达40.4%。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的基于LLM的网页代理框架，在推理能力和执行效率方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

Motivation: 解决当前不清楚LLMs在数学问题上的成功是源于搜索、记忆过程还是规则一致推理的问题，提供更准确的推理能力评估方法。

Method: 将思维链建模为基于规则的有向无环图过程，节点表示中间推导状态，边编码规则应用，并构建DAG-MATH格式的基准测试。

Result: 在标准数学推理数据集上发现，即使PASS@k指标相似，不同LLM家族在推理保真度上存在显著差异，揭示了最终答案准确性与规则一致推导之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式思维链和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLMs推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments
remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific
interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long

WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal

Result: 在RelBench基准测试中，RELATE性能达到模式特定编码器的97%，同时参数数量减少多达5倍。

Conclusion: RELATE支持不同模式，实现了关系图数据的多数据集预训练，为关系图数据的基础模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

Conclusion: 生成式AI与检测技术之间的猫鼠游戏仍在继续，UVeye的分层解决方案代表了在检测、缓解和威慑新型欺诈能力上的重大进步。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何能够将完全不同的信息隐藏在看似连贯合理的文本中，揭示文本内容与作者意图之间的脱节现象。

Method: 使用8亿参数的开源LLM，通过简单高效的协议在相同长度的文本中编码和解码隐藏信息，可在笔记本电脑上快速完成。

Result: 即使是中等规模的LLM也能实现高质量的隐藏效果，例如将政治批评隐藏在赞扬文本中，或将秘密手稿隐藏在普通产品评论中。

Conclusion: 这种技术进一步削弱了对书面通信的信任，提出了关于AI安全、LLM知识本质以及文本真实性的紧迫问题。

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Motivation: 传统被动式聊天机器人无法满足金融领域对主动、合规、个性化投资洞察的需求，需要开发能够在高风险金融环境中提供可信AI见解的系统。

Method: 采用组件化编排层进行确定性路由、混合检索管道结合OpenSearch和金融领域嵌入模型、多阶段推荐机制整合规则启发式、序列行为建模和上下文多臂老虎机，在24个NVIDIA H100 GPU上使用Docker Swarm和vLLM完全本地化部署。

Result: 通过人工QA和系统指标验证，表明基于事实的生成与显式路由和分层安全机制能够在高风险金融环境中提供可信的AI洞察。

Conclusion: 在金融领域部署生成式AI时，基于事实的生成、显式路由和分层安全机制对于提供可信的AI见解至关重要，特别是在高风险环境中。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

TL;DR: HCLA是一个以人为中心的多智能体异常检测系统，用于数字资产交易分析。该系统通过自然语言对话界面让非专家用户能够查询、检查分析结果并获得解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高金融取证中的透明度和信任度，让非专家用户也能理解和使用复杂的异常检测系统。

Method: 采用多智能体架构，包含解析、检测和解释三个角色，使用XGBoost作为基础检测器，通过自然语言界面与用户交互。

Result: 在比特币混币数据集上，基线检测器达到较高准确率，HCLA系统在此基础上增加了可解释性和交互优化能力。

Conclusion: 人机协作设计能够显著改善金融取证系统的透明度和用户信任度。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial
forensics.

### [102] [The Verification-Value Paradox: A Normative Critique of Gen AI in Legal Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20109)
*Joshua Yuvaraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文认为需要重新评估AI在法律实践中的使用，提出了验证-价值悖论，指出AI带来的效率提升会被相应的验证需求所抵消，导致净价值往往微乎其微。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于律师因提交不准确的AI生成内容而受到谴责的案例，以及AI与现实脱节、缺乏透明度的特点，需要重新评估AI在法律实践中的使用范式。

Method: 提出验证-价值悖论模型，分析AI使用效率提升与验证需求之间的平衡关系。

Result: AI在法律实践中带来的效率提升会被相应的手动验证需求所抵消，导致净价值往往可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 需要新的AI使用范式，强调法律实践中应坚持对真相的忠诚和公民责任等核心价值观。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

### [103] [TRUST: A Decentralized Framework for Auditing Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20188)
*Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Pingzhi Li,Zhuo Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRUST框架，一个去中心化的大语言模型推理审计系统，通过共识机制、分层DAG分解、区块链账本和隐私保护技术解决现有集中式审计的四大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型审计方法存在集中化、不透明、难以扩展的问题，无法有效验证推理链的忠实性和无害性，在关键领域部署专有模型存在重大风险。

Method: TRUST框架包含：1) 多样化审计者共识机制；2) 分层DAG推理链分解实现可扩展并行审计；3) 区块链账本记录验证决策；4) 隐私保护的分段共享技术。

Result: 实验表明TRUST能有效检测推理缺陷，在30%恶意参与者情况下仍保持稳健，适用于多种LLM和推理任务（数学、医疗、科学、人文）。

Conclusion: TRUST开创了去中心化AI审计的新范式，为大语言模型的安全可信部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

### [104] [The Lock-In Phase Hypothesis: Identity Consolidation as a Precursor to AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20190)
*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出AGI发展需要经历从开放模仿到身份固化的锁定阶段，通过实验展示了不同规模模型在这一过程中的行为变化和性能影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AGI发展过程中的身份固化现象，认为从开放模仿到稳定身份的形成是AGI可靠性的前提，也是安全控制的关键点。

Method: 形式化身份固化阶段，将其与学习动态中的已知现象联系起来，提出操作性的起始检测指标，并通过实验验证不同规模模型的行为变化。

Result: 实验发现行为固化是快速非线性的，但对通用能力的影响不是单一的：小模型出现性能权衡，中等规模模型几乎无成本，大型量化模型出现瞬时不稳定性。

Conclusion: 身份固化是AGI级可靠性的先决条件，也是安全的关键控制点，既可被工程化设计以实现可靠性，也可能在扩展过程中自发形成，导致不可预测的目标和行为固化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了在2048游戏中优化AI的进化训练方法，比较了单智能体系统和双智能体系统，发现单智能体系统通过价值函数优化取得了显著改进，而双智能体系统改进有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化AI在动态环境中的性能是机器学习研究的基本挑战，2048游戏结合了策略游戏和随机元素，是研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应的理想平台。

Method: 实现了两种系统：双智能体元提示系统（思考者LLM为执行者LLM优化策略）和基于价值函数优化的单智能体系统（使用受限蒙特卡洛树搜索），并实验了回滚功能以避免性能退化。

Result: 单智能体系统取得了显著改进，每个训练周期平均增加473.2分，且呈现明显上升趋势（相关性ρ=0.607）。LLM对游戏的理解也随着高级策略的发展而增长。双智能体系统改进有限，显示了元提示的内在局限性。

Conclusion: 进化优化技术在非确定性环境中改善AI性能具有潜力，单智能体方法比双智能体元提示方法更有效。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了个性化认知模拟(ICS)任务，评估不同认知表征方法在模拟个体思维过程方面的效果。通过构建小说数据集和11条件认知评估框架，测试了7个现成LLM在模仿作者风格方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM能够表面模仿人类行为，但其模拟更深层次个性化认知过程的能力仍不清楚。研究旨在填补这一空白，评估LLM在模拟个体思维过程方面的能力。

Method: 构建基于近期出版小说（晚于测试LLM发布日期）的数据集，提出11条件认知评估框架，测试7个现成LLM在作者风格模仿方面的表现。比较不同认知表征方法，包括语言特征、概念映射和基于档案的信息。

Result: 结果显示，结合概念和语言特征在ICS中特别有效，在整体评估中优于基于静态档案的线索。LLM在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效，突显了其在更深层次认知模拟方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，推进了更个性化和人类对齐的创意技术发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型通过上下文学习生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，以自然语言指定的抽象目标为基础，验证了GPT-4o在简单场景下能有效合成规划领域抽象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态领域中生成与特定目的对齐的抽象表示这一挑战，因为抽象选择会影响智能体的规划、推理和解释能力。

Method: 在PDDL中建模智能体具体行为，利用大型语言模型的上下文学习能力，根据自然语言指定的抽象目标生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，并通过符号验证工具和专家评估。

Result: GPT-4o在简单设置下通常能合成有用的规划领域抽象，但在抽象动作方面表现优于抽象相关流变量。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在生成规划领域抽象方面具有潜力，特别是在动作抽象方面表现良好，但在流变量抽象方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

TL;DR: 提出了STaBERT模型，通过整合POI信息和时间描述符来增强人类移动性预测的语义理解，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型要么只建模位置序列，要么仅将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用兴趣点(POI)提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 提出STaBERT模型，在BERT-based移动性模型中整合时间描述符和POI嵌入，构建统一的语义增强移动性表示。

Result: 显著提升预测准确性：单城市预测GEO-BLEU从0.34提升到0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升到0.56。

Conclusion: 整合POI和时间信息能有效捕捉人类移动的语义基础，显著改善移动性预测性能。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

TL;DR: ToolEQA是一个集成外部工具和多步推理的EQA智能体，通过工具提供有用信息来改进探索方向和答案准确性，同时减少了探索距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的EQA方法直接使用VLMs探索环境回答问题，缺乏显式思考和规划，导致推理能力有限、探索效率低下和回答效果不佳。

Method: 提出ToolEQA智能体，集成外部工具进行多步推理；设计自动生成EQA任务的数据生成管道，构建包含18K任务的EQA-RT数据集。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen测试集上，ToolEQA比最先进基线方法成功率提升9.2~20.2%，比零样本ToolEQA高10%；在HM-EQA、OpenEQA和EXPRESS-Bench数据集上也达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过集成外部工具和多步推理，显著提升了EQA任务的性能，证明了该方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

TL;DR: 本文基于AI4HealthyAging项目经验，分析了临床数据收集中存在的多种偏见类型，并提出了改进医疗AI系统公平性和鲁棒性的实用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在医疗领域前景广阔，但由于训练数据的质量和公平性问题，AI解决方案在真实临床实践中的整合仍然有限。数据收集过程中的偏见是主要障碍。

Method: 基于西班牙国家研发计划AI4HealthyAging项目的经验，识别临床数据收集中存在的多种偏见类型，包括历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见等。

Result: 在多个用例中发现了多种偏见类型，这些偏见体现在性别、年龄、居住地、社会经济地位、设备和标签等变量中。

Conclusion: 提出了改进临床问题设计和数据收集公平性和鲁棒性的实用建议，希望为未来开发更公平的医疗AI系统提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Conclusion: 该模型为评估军事行动中AI系统打击效果提供了透明推理机制，有助于建立负责任的智能系统。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的出现，知识图谱构建正从基于规则和统计的流程转向语言驱动和生成框架，需要系统梳理这一范式转变。

Method: 从两个互补视角回顾新兴LLM驱动方法：基于模式的范式强调结构、规范化和一致性；无模式范式强调灵活性、适应性和开放发现。

Result: 系统分析了各阶段的代表性框架、技术机制及其局限性，阐明了LLM与知识图谱之间不断演化的相互作用。

Conclusion: 调查展望了关键趋势和未来研究方向，包括基于KG的LLM推理、智能体系统的动态知识记忆和多模态KG构建，旨在桥接符号知识工程和神经语义理解。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续预训练方法要么需要原始基础模型权重，要么依赖外部领域知识库，这在基础模型权重被保留或可靠外部语料不可用时存在实际障碍。

Method: IKnow框架在指令-响应对话格式中制定新的自监督目标，利用文本本身嵌入的领域知识，在更深语义层次进行编码学习。

Result: 该方法能够适应新领域而不会退化模型的指令跟随能力和语义表示。

Conclusion: IKnow提供了一个简单通用的框架，在不依赖外部资源的情况下实现语言模型的持续适应。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

Abstract: This paper presents a new computational model of creative outcomes, informed

opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was
evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EBR的神经推理器，通过嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，解决了传统描述逻辑推理器对不一致和错误数据不鲁棒的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经符号概念学习方法大多依赖描述逻辑推理器，但这些推理器对知识库中的不一致和错误数据不鲁棒，限制了在真实世界知识库中的部署。

Method: EBR使用嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，仅需要检索原子概念和存在限制的实例，就能检索或近似SHOIQ描述逻辑中任何概念的实例集。

Result: 实验表明，EBR在缺失和错误数据的情况下表现出鲁棒性，优于现有推理器。

Conclusion: EBR为在真实世界知识库中部署神经符号概念学习方法提供了可行的解决方案，通过神经推理器实现了对符号推理的有效近似。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

*Yiwen Peng,Thomas Bonald,Fabian M. Suchanek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FLORA是一种基于模糊逻辑的无监督知识图谱对齐方法，能够同时对齐实体和关系，提供可解释的结果，并在主要基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注纯实体级对齐，在嵌入空间中计算实体相似度，缺乏可解释的推理且需要训练数据。

Method: 基于模糊逻辑的迭代方法，提供实体和关系的整体对齐，允许悬空实体存在，并具有可证明的收敛性。

Result: 在主要基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单有效的无监督知识图谱对齐方法，具有可解释性、收敛性和处理悬空实体的能力。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家在AI治理中的公众参与情况，发现政府未能建立有效的对话机制，参与率低于1%，且官员对反馈的响应有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨政府在AI治理中如何收集和回应公众意见，以及这种参与是否能建立对AI及其治理的信任。

Method: 采用景观分析方法，比较三个国家（澳大利亚、哥伦比亚、美国）征集AI风险和政策的公众反馈的方式及其对治理的影响。

Result: 研究发现政府未能吸引多样化声音或宣传征集活动，大多数公民不知情或未准备回应；官员对反馈的响应有限，未能建立有效的反馈循环。

Conclusion: 当前参与式AI治理方法难以建立信任或合法性，因为决策者未能充分倾听或回应公众关切。作者提出了八项改进建议。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络加速的网络拓扑优化方法，用于解决电网拥堵管理问题，实现了对未见拓扑变化和跨系统的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在大规模系统中难以实时求解网络拓扑优化问题，现有机器学习方法泛化能力有限，无法适应不同拓扑结构和运行条件。

Method: 开发了异构边感知消息传递神经网络，基于线性化交流潮流模型预测有效的母线分裂动作作为候选拓扑优化解。

Result: 在GOC 2000节点系统上实现了4个数量级的加速，1分钟内提供交流可行解，最优性差距仅为2.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现大规模系统近实时网络拓扑优化迈出了重要一步，具有拓扑和跨系统泛化能力。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CaSE方法，通过评估推理步骤的相关性和连贯性来改进LLM推理能力，而不仅仅是检查最终答案的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估LLM主要关注最终答案正确性，这种方法过于粗糙，忽略了推理过程的质量，无法有效指导模型改进。

Method: 引入因果逐步评估(CaSE)方法，将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，使用前文信息评估每个推理步骤，避免后见之明偏差。

Result: 在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准测试上验证了CaSE与人工评估的一致性，使用CaSE评估的数据进行训练能直接提升最终任务性能。

Conclusion: CaSE提供了一个可扩展的框架来分析、调试和改进LLM推理，证明了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

TL;DR: 提出了两种可扩展的随机游走中心性算法，一种基于近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计，另一种基于采样根生成树，两者都实现了近似线性时间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走中心性是图挖掘中量化节点重要性的基本指标，但现有方法计算成本高，无法应用于大型网络。

Method: 提出随机游走中心性的新公式化方法，开发了两种算法：基于近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计的方法，以及基于采样根生成树的方法。

Result: 在包括超过1000万个节点的大型真实网络上的实验表明，所提算法具有高效性和良好的近似质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法在近线性时间内实现了随机游走中心性的高效计算，为大规模网络分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Motivation: 需要建立可信赖的自动决策模型，促进在现实应用中的信任、问责和安全采用。

Method: 形式化定义监督学习设置，分析三类可解释模型家族（特征重要性、规则和基于实例的模型），并正式定义三个伦理属性（因果性、公平性、隐私性）及其评估指标。

Result: 建立了开发不仅准确可解释，而且公平、隐私保护和因果感知的可信AI系统的理论基础。

Conclusion: MIMOSA框架为开发可信AI系统提供了理论基础，通过模型生成过程中评估伦理指标，实现可解释性与伦理属性的平衡。

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务评估基准存在任务多样性不足、模态覆盖不全、数据合成化以及语言支持有限等问题，无法可靠评估模型在复杂真实购物场景中的表现。

Method: 构建包含6个类别和37个任务（含8个多模态任务）的基准测试，数据主要来自真实客户查询和交易日志，采用半自动流程生成参考答案，由50多名专家审核修改，并为每个问题定义难度级别。

Result: EcomEval覆盖7种语言（包括5种东南亚低资源语言），提供了多语言视角，能够进行面向挑战的细粒度评估。

Conclusion: EcomEval填补了电子商务领域评估基准的空白，为评估大语言模型在真实复杂购物场景中的能力提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Motivation: 需要量化模型在动态扩展环境中的适应能力，评估模型对状态变化的理解、预测和调整能力，为超级智能模型设定适应性标准。

Method: 引入流动性指数(FI)作为量化指标，通过闭环开放式真实世界基准测试评估模型的上下文切换和连续性能力，测量模型在扩展环境中的状态变化适应能力。

Result: 建立了评估模型适应性的框架，区分了闭式和开放式基准测试，提出了至少需要二阶适应性的超级智能模型标准。

Conclusion: 真正的超级智能模型应具备至少二阶适应性，能够通过数字补充实现自我维持计算，达到最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家评分、人工标注和缓慢的成对判断，自动化方法主要使用图结构代理指标，但过于简化复杂推理过程

Method: 引入拓扑数据分析框架，捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构，实现标签高效的自动化评估

Result: 拓扑特征在评估推理质量方面比标准图指标具有显著更高的预测能力，表明有效推理由高维几何结构而非纯关系图更好捕捉

Conclusion: 紧凑稳定的拓扑特征集可靠地指示轨迹质量，为未来强化学习算法提供实用信号

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT是一个两阶段强化微调的KGQA框架，通过'计划-KG搜索-网络搜索-思考'范式，使LLM能够在知识不完整条件下进行自主规划和跨KG与网络的自适应检索调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA方法难以充分利用KG中的丰富知识和LLM的推理能力，在复杂场景下存在KG覆盖不完整、缺乏外部信息判断机制、推理局部短视等问题。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用定制化计划-检索数据集进行思维链微调，激活结构化推理；2) 引入计划-检索引导的强化学习过程，整合显式规划和检索动作，采用笛卡尔式规划模块分解复杂问题，逻辑表达式指导工具调用。

Result: 该方法解决了GRPO冷启动问题，实现了覆盖感知的检索调度，支持全局一致的多步推理。

Conclusion: Graph-RFT通过多奖励设计优化推理检索过程，使模型能够学习何时以及如何有效结合KG和网络检索。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于广义均值积分的一致性感知AGI度量方法，替代了传统算术平均方法，强调平衡能力而非补偿性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGI定义使用算术平均，假设领域间能力可补偿，但真正的通用智能应反映所有关键领域的平衡能力。

Method: 基于广义均值在补偿性指数连续体上的积分，涵盖算术、几何和调和均值机制，通过曲线下面积量化不同补偿性假设下的鲁棒性。

Result: 应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域得分，一致性调整的AUC显示尽管算术得分高（GPT-5达24%），但系统仍远未达到通用能力。

Conclusion: 广义均值积分提供了一个原则性、可解释且更严格的AGI进展度量基础，惩罚不平衡并捕捉领域间依赖关系。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

TL;DR: 提出一个混合框架，将统计因果发现算法与金融知识图谱和LLM推理相结合，显著提升了三种主流因果发现方法(PC、GES、NOTEARS)的性能，为投资组合管理提供可靠的因果分析基础。


<details>

Motivation: 传统投资组合管理依赖相关性分析和启发式方法，无法捕捉真正的因果关系。需要一种能够结合领域知识来增强因果发现可靠性的方法。

Method: 开发混合框架，整合统计因果发现算法(PC、GES、NOTEARS)与两个互补知识源：从SEC 10-K文件中提取的金融知识图谱和LLM概念推理。通过算法编码知识图谱约束，并利用LLM进行假设生成。

Result: 在包含500家公司18个变量的合成金融数据集上，KG+LLM增强方法在所有三种算法上都表现出一致改进：PC(F1: 0.622 vs 0.459, +36%)、GES(F1: 0.735 vs 0.367, +100%)、NOTEARS(F1: 0.759 vs 0.163, +366%)。反事实预测的MAE为0.003610，干预效应的方向准确率达到100%。

Abstract: Portfolio managers rely on correlation-based analysis and heuristic methods
that fail to capture true causal relationships driving performance. We present
a hybrid framework that integrates statistical causal discovery algorithms with
domain knowledge from two complementary sources: a financial knowledge graph
extracted from SEC 10-K filings and large language model reasoning. Our
approach systematically enhances three representative causal discovery
paradigms, constraint-based (PC), score-based (GES), and continuous

and leveraging LLM conceptual reasoning for hypothesis generation. Evaluated on
a synthetic financial dataset of 500 firms across 18 variables, our
KG+LLM-enhanced methods demonstrate consistent improvements across all three

+100%), and NOTEARS (F1: 0.759 vs. 0.163, +366%). The framework enables
reliable scenario analysis with mean absolute error of 0.003610 for
counterfactual predictions and perfect directional accuracy for intervention
effects. It also addresses critical limitations of existing methods by
grounding statistical discoveries in financial domain expertise while
maintaining empirical validation, providing portfolio managers with the causal
foundation necessary for proactive risk management and strategic

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: M2VN是一个多模态深度学习框架，用于金融波动率预测，结合时间序列特征和新闻数据，通过深度神经网络解决多模态数据融合和前瞻性偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融波动率预测中两个关键挑战：异构数据模态（数值金融数据和文本信息）的对齐与融合，以及减轻可能削弱金融模型有效性的前瞻性偏差。

Method: 结合开源市场特征和Time Machine GPT生成的新闻嵌入，确保时间完整性；在深度学习架构中引入辅助对齐损失来增强结构化与非结构化数据的整合。

Result: 广泛实验表明，M2VN始终优于现有基线方法，突显其在动态市场中风险管理和金融决策的实用价值。

Conclusion: M2VN通过多模态深度学习方法成功提升了金融波动率预测的准确性，为金融风险管理提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: We introduce M2VN: Multi-Modal Volatility Network, a novel deep
learning-based framework for financial volatility forecasting that unifies time
series features with unstructured news data. M2VN leverages the
representational power of deep neural networks to address two key challenges in
this domain: (i) aligning and fusing heterogeneous data modalities, numerical
financial data and textual information, and (ii) mitigating look-ahead bias
that can undermine the validity of financial models. To achieve this, M2VN
combines open-source market features with news embeddings generated by Time
Machine GPT, a recently introduced point-in-time LLM, ensuring temporal
integrity. An auxiliary alignment loss is introduced to enhance the integration
of structured and unstructured data within the deep learning architecture.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that M2VN consistently outperforms existing
baselines, underscoring its practical value for risk management and financial
decision-making in dynamic markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计用户对内容审核干预的响应对于制定有效和用户中心的审核策略至关重要，需要了解哪些用户特征与不同行为响应相关。

Method: 采用量化分析框架，使用贪婪特征选择策略分析753个社会行为、语言、关系和心理特征，预测16.8K用户在Reddit审核干预后的行为变化。

Result: 识别出少量在所有任务中一致有效的特征，发现预测性能因任务而异，活动度和毒性变化比多样性变化更容易预测。

Conclusion: 研究为开发准确预测用户对审核干预反应的系统铺平道路，强调有效审核应根据用户特征和干预具体目标进行定制。

Abstract: Accurately estimating how users respond to moderation interventions is
paramount for developing effective and user-centred moderation strategies.
However, this requires a clear understanding of which user characteristics are
associated with different behavioural responses, which is the goal of this
work. We investigate the informativeness of 753 socio-behavioural, linguistic,
relational, and psychological features, in predicting the behavioural changes
of 16.8K users affected by a major moderation intervention on Reddit. To reach
this goal, we frame the problem in terms of "quantification", a task
well-suited to estimating shifts in aggregate user behaviour. We then apply a
greedy feature selection strategy with the double goal of (i) identifying the
features that are most predictive of changes in user activity, toxicity, and
participation diversity, and (ii) estimating their importance. Our results
allow identifying a small set of features that are consistently informative
across all tasks, and determining that many others are either task-specific or
of limited utility altogether. We also find that predictive performance varies
according to the task, with changes in activity and toxicity being easier to
estimate than changes in diversity. Overall, our results pave the way for the
development of accurate systems that predict user reactions to moderation
interventions. Furthermore, our findings highlight the complexity of
post-moderation user behaviour, and indicate that effective moderation should
be tailored not only to user traits but also to the specific objective of the
intervention.

Conclusion: AI生成文本在社会研究中存在局限性，强调实证人类数据收集的持续重要性

Abstract: Large Language Models are being used in conversational agents that simulate
human conversations and generate social studies data. While concerns about the
models' biases have been raised and discussed in the literature, much about the
data generated is still unknown. In this study we explore the statistical
representation of social values across four countries (UK, Argentina, USA and
China) for six LLMs, with equal representation for open and closed weights. By
comparing machine-generated outputs with actual human survey data, we assess
whether algorithmic biases in LLMs outweigh the biases inherent in real- world
sampling, including demographic and response biases. Our findings suggest that,
despite the logistical and financial constraints of human surveys, even a
small, skewed sample of real respondents may provide more reliable insights
than synthetic data produced by LLMs. These results highlight the limitations
of using AI-generated text for social research and emphasize the continued
importance of empirical human data collection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在高风险领域的广泛应用，现有的评估和监控方法越来越难以提供有效监督，迫切需要新的方法来缩小责任差距。

Method: 采用合作式公共AI红队测试方法，包括在CAMLIS 2024、NIST ARIA试点和新加坡IMDA等多个场景中实施的实际演练。

Result: 该方法在多个试点实施中取得了有意义的成果，证明能够有效识别AI系统的风险和安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 合作式公共AI红队测试方法既能提供有意义的评估结果，又具有扩展到多个AI发展司法管辖区的可扩展性。

Abstract: AI systems have the potential to produce both benefits and harms, but without
rigorous and ongoing adversarial evaluation, AI actors will struggle to assess
the breadth and magnitude of the AI risk surface. Researchers from the field of
systems design have developed several effective sociotechnical AI evaluation
and red teaming techniques targeting bias, hate speech, mis/disinformation, and
other documented harm classes. However, as increasingly sophisticated AI
systems are released into high-stakes sectors (such as education, healthcare,
and intelligence-gathering), our current evaluation and monitoring methods are
proving less and less capable of delivering effective oversight.
  In order to actually deliver responsible AI and to ensure AI's harms are
fully understood and its security vulnerabilities mitigated, pioneering new
approaches to close this "responsibility gap" are now more urgent than ever. In
this paper, we propose one such approach, the cooperative public AI red-teaming
exercise, and discuss early results of its prior pilot implementations. This
approach is intertwined with CAMLIS itself: the first in-person public
demonstrator exercise was held in conjunction with CAMLIS 2024. We review the
operational design and results of this exercise, the prior National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s Assessing the Risks and Impacts of AI
(ARIA) pilot exercise, and another similar exercise conducted with the
Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). Ultimately, we argue
that this approach is both capable of delivering meaningful results and is also
scalable to many AI developing jurisdictions.

Motivation: 解决终端设备计算能力有限的问题，利用多无人机协作提供边缘计算服务，优化任务完成延迟和系统能耗之间的权衡。

Method: 使用有向无环图建模子任务依赖关系，设计两时间尺度框架，提出基于惩罚对偶分解和逐次凸逼近的PDD-SCA算法，将原MINLP问题转化为连续形式并分解为三个嵌套子问题求解。

Conclusion: 该多无人机协作MEC框架通过优化子任务卸载、资源分配和无人机轨迹，有效提升了系统性能，实现了延迟和能耗的优化平衡。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted
collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) framework, where the computing tasks
of terminal devices (TDs) can be decomposed into serial or parallel sub-tasks
and offloaded to collaborative UAVs. We first model the dependencies among all
sub-tasks as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and design a two-timescale frame
structure to decouple the sub-task interdependencies for sub-task scheduling.
Then, a joint sub-task offloading, computational resource allocation, and UAV
trajectories optimization problem is formulated, which aims to minimize the
system cost, i.e., the weighted sum of the task completion delay and the system
energy consumption. To solve this non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear
programming (MINLP) problem, a penalty dual decomposition and successive convex
approximation (PDD-SCA) algorithm is developed. Particularly, the original
MINLP problem is equivalently transferred into a continuous form relying on PDD
theory. By decoupling the resulting problem into three nested subproblems, the
SCA method is further combined to recast the non-convex components and obtain
desirable solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) Compared to the
benchmark algorithms, the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the system
cost, and thus realize an improved trade-off between task latency and energy
consumption; 2) The proposed algorithm can achieve an efficient workload
balancing for distributed computation across multiple UAVs.

Abstract: This article presents early findings from designing, deploying and evaluating
an AI-based educational agent deployed as the primary instructor in a
graduate-level Cloud Computing course at IISc. We detail the design of a Large
Language Model (LLM)-driven Instructor Agent, and introduce a pedagogical
framework that integrates the Instructor Agent into the course workflow for
actively interacting with the students for content delivery, supplemented by
the human instructor to offer the course structure and undertake
question--answer sessions. We also propose an analytical framework that
evaluates the Agent--Student interaction transcripts using interpretable
engagement metrics of topic coverage, topic depth and turn-level elaboration.
We report early experiences on how students interact with the Agent to explore
concepts, clarify doubts and sustain inquiry-driven dialogue during live
classroom sessions. We also report preliminary analysis on our evaluation
metrics applied across two successive instructional modules that reveals
patterns of engagement evolution, transitioning from broad conceptual
exploration to deeper, focused inquiry. These demonstrate how structured
integration of conversational AI agents can foster reflective learning, offer a
reproducible methodology for studying engagement in authentic classroom
settings, and support scalable, high-quality higher education.

Motivation: 将米切尔关于图片具有能动性的理论应用于当代AI图像生成工具，探索AI生成图像的内在"欲望"和特性。

Method: 借鉴艺术史关于抽象本质的论述，分析多模态文本到图像模型的工作原理，揭示文本与图像在数学表示上的可通约性。

Result: 发现AI生成图像因其抽象本质而渴望具体化，文本到图像的转换过程掩盖了表征回归，制造了形式转换的假象。

Conclusion: AI生成图像的内在需求是具体性和明确性，这源于其根本的抽象特性，而用户界面掩盖了文本与图像之间的复杂转换过程。

Abstract: W.J.T. Mitchell's influential essay 'What do pictures want?' shifts the
theoretical focus away from the interpretative act of understanding pictures
and from the motivations of the humans who create them to the possibility that
the picture itself is an entity with agency and wants. In this article, I
reframe Mitchell's question in light of contemporary AI image generation tools
to ask: what do AI-generated images want? Drawing from art historical discourse
on the nature of abstraction, I argue that AI-generated images want specificity
and concreteness because they are fundamentally abstract. Multimodal
text-to-image models, which are the primary subject of this article, are based
on the premise that text and image are interchangeable or exchangeable tokens
and that there is a commensurability between them, at least as represented
mathematically in data. The user pipeline that sees textual input become visual
output, however, obscures this representational regress and makes it seem like
one form transforms into the other -- as if by magic.

Motivation: 随着LLM被广泛采用来加速创新，需要识别这种范式中的系统性风险，保护个体创作者的利益，确保创新生态系统的长期可持续性。

Method: 引入两个核心概念：想法单元（代表创新的可传输功能逻辑）和想法安全性（保护的多维标准），分析吸收机制，并提出治理和工程议程。

Result: 识别了黑箱吸收风险，提出了保护创作者贡献的具体框架，确保贡献可追溯、可控和公平。

Conclusion: 需要建立具体的治理和工程措施来缓解黑箱吸收风险，保护创新生态系统，确保创作者贡献得到适当保护。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly adopted as critical tools for
accelerating innovation. This paper identifies and formalizes a systemic risk
inherent in this paradigm: \textbf{Black Box Absorption}. We define this as the
process by which the opaque internal architectures of LLM platforms, often
operated by large-scale service providers, can internalize, generalize, and
repurpose novel concepts contributed by users during interaction. This
mechanism threatens to undermine the foundational principles of innovation
economics by creating severe informational and structural asymmetries between
individual creators and platform operators, thereby jeopardizing the long-term
sustainability of the innovation ecosystem. To analyze this challenge, we
introduce two core concepts: the idea unit, representing the transportable
functional logic of an innovation, and idea safety, a multidimensional standard
for its protection. This paper analyzes the mechanisms of absorption and
proposes a concrete governance and engineering agenda to mitigate these risks,
ensuring that creator contributions remain traceable, controllable, and
equitable.

TL;DR: 本文研究了推荐系统对内容创作者收入公平性的影响，提出使用有序成对比较方法来改善创作者公平性，同时保持用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台为内容创作者提供收入，但推荐系统可能不公平地分配流量和收入。现有研究表明高质量内容不一定获得最多关注和收入，但缺乏针对性解决方案。

Method: 使用理论分析和合成数据集模拟，测试有序成对比较方法。在MovieLens数据集上验证该方法的有效性，并研究其在存在历史偏见平台上的表现。

Result: 有序成对比较克服了新物品的冷启动问题，显著提高所有内容创作者获得公平结果的机会。该方法在平台早期部署时效果最佳，但随着现有偏见强度增加，效果会减弱。

Conclusion: 有序成对比较方法为新建和现有平台提供了一个可行的替代方案，能够在改善创作者公平性的同时维持用户满意度。

Abstract: Social media platforms provide millions of professional content creators with
sustainable incomes. Their income is largely influenced by their number of
views and followers, which in turn depends on the platform's recommender system
(RS). So, as with regular jobs, it is important to ensure that RSs distribute
revenue in a fair way. For example, prior work analyzed whether the creators of
the highest-quality content would receive the most followers and income.
Results showed this is unlikely to be the case, but did not suggest targeted
solutions. In this work, we first use theoretical analysis and simulations on
synthetic datasets to understand the system better and find interventions that
improve fairness for creators. We find that the use of ordered pairwise
comparison overcomes the cold start problem for a new set of items and greatly
increases the chance of achieving fair outcomes for all content creators.
Importantly, it also maintains user satisfaction. We also test the intervention
on the MovieLens dataset and investigate its effectiveness on platforms with
interaction histories that are currently unfair for content creators. These
experiments reveal that the intervention improves fairness when deployed at
early stages of the platform, but the effect decreases as the strength of
pre-existing bias increases. Altogether, we find that the ordered pairwise
comparison approach might offer a plausible alternative for both new and
existing platforms to implement.

Result: SMIS评分与传统ESG评分差异显著，2010-2023年间高SMIS公司实现显著超额收益。

Conclusion: 市场隐含的可持续性评分能更准确反映公司可持续性，且与财务表现正相关。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop a market-implied sustainability score for
companies, based on the extent to which a stock is over- or under-represented
in sustainable funds compared to traditional ones. To identify sustainable
funds, we rely on the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), a
European framework designed to clearly categorize investment funds into
different classes according to their commitment to sustainability. In our
analysis, we classify as sustainable those funds categorized as Article 9 -
also known as "dark green" - and compare them to funds categorized as Article 8
or Article 6.
  We compute an SFDR Market-Implied Sustainability (SMIS) score for a large set
of European companies. We then conduct an econometric analysis to identify the
factors influencing SMIS and compare them with state-of-the-art ESG
(Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores provided by Refinitiv. Finally,
we assess the realized risk-adjusted performance of stocks using
portfolio-tilting strategies.
  Our results show that SMIS scores deviate substantially from traditional ESG
scores and that, over the period 2010-2023, companies with high SMIS have been
associated with significant financial outperformance.

Abstract: Soft robotics increasingly relies on smart materials and innovative
structures, with bistable tape springs emerging as a promising option. These
structures exhibit intriguing dynamic behaviors, such as oscillation, due to
their inherent bistability. This paper explores the high-speed linear
amplification of motion achieved through the excitation of a looped bistable
tape spring. When looped, the tape spring forms two distinct joints,
facilitating smooth oscillation. Mounted on a linear guide and driven by a
crank mechanism with varying frequency, the system converts input oscillations
into amplified linear motion at resonance. This study highlights the potential
of bistable tape springs high speed reciprocating linear motion.

Abstract: We study the problem of jointly selecting sensing agents and synthesizing
decentralized active perception policies for the chosen subset of agents within
a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP)
framework. Our approach employs a two-layer optimization structure. In the
inner layer, we introduce information-theoretic metrics, defined by the mutual
information between the unknown trajectories or some hidden property in the
environment and the collective partial observations in the multi-agent system,
as a unified objective for active perception problems. We employ various
optimization methods to obtain optimal sensor policies that maximize mutual
information for distinct active perception tasks. In the outer layer, we prove
that under certain conditions, the information-theoretic objectives are
monotone and submodular with respect to the subset of observations collected
from multiple agents. We then exploit this property to design an IMAS$^2$
(Information-theoretic Multi-Agent Selection and Sensing) algorithm for joint
sensing agent selection and sensing policy synthesis. However, since the policy
search space is infinite, we adapt the classical Nemhauser-Wolsey argument to
prove that the proposed IMAS$^2$ algorithm can provide a tight $(1 -
1/e)$-guarantee on the performance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in a multi-agent cooperative perception in a grid-world
environment.

Conclusion: 模仿学习方法能有效近似复杂优化控制，显著降低计算负担，适合实时微电网能量管理应用。

Abstract: Efficient energy management is essential for reliable and sustainable
microgrid operation amid increasing renewable integration. This paper proposes
an imitation learning-based framework to approximate mixed-integer Economic
Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for microgrid energy management. The proposed
method trains a neural network to imitate expert EMPC control actions from
offline trajectories, enabling fast, real-time decision making without solving
optimization problems online. To enhance robustness and generalization, the
learning process includes noise injection during training to mitigate
distribution shift and explicitly incorporates forecast uncertainty in
renewable generation and demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the
learned policy achieves economic performance comparable to EMPC while only
requiring $10\%$ of the computation time of optimization-based EMPC in
practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a safe control synthesis method that integrates
state estimation and parameter estimation within an adaptive optimal control
(AOC) and control barrier function (CBF)-based control architecture. The
developed approach decouples safety objectives from the learning objectives
using a CBF-based guarding controller where the CBFs are robustified to account
for the lack of full-state measurements. The coupling of this guarding
controller with the AOC-based stabilizing control guarantees safety and
regulation despite the lack of full state measurement. The paper leverages
recent advancements in deep neural network-based adaptive observers to ensure
safety in the presence of state estimation errors. Safety and convergence
guarantees are provided using a Lyapunov-based analysis, and the effectiveness
of the developed controller is demonstrated through simulation under mild
excitation conditions.

Method: 集成LLM驱动的推理与语音处理模块，开发结构化部署管道，在移动和边缘设备上实现实时语音处理，保持低延迟和高准确性。

Result: 在真实世界言语障碍数据集和边缘设备延迟测试中，SpeechAgent表现出高效和用户友好的性能。

Conclusion: SpeechAgent证明了为言语障碍用户提供个性化日常辅助通信的可行性。

Abstract: Speech is essential for human communication, yet millions of people face
impairments such as dysarthria, stuttering, and aphasia conditions that often
lead to social isolation and reduced participation. Despite recent progress in
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies,
accessible web and mobile infrastructures for users with impaired speech remain
limited, hindering the practical adoption of these advances in daily
communication. To bridge this gap, we present SpeechAgent, a mobile SpeechAgent
designed to facilitate people with speech impairments in everyday
communication. The system integrates large language model (LLM)- driven
reasoning with advanced speech processing modules, providing adaptive support
tailored to diverse impairment types. To ensure real-world practicality, we
develop a structured deployment pipeline that enables real-time speech
processing on mobile and edge devices, achieving imperceptible latency while
maintaining high accuracy and speech quality. Evaluation on real-world impaired
speech datasets and edge-device latency profiling confirms that SpeechAgent
delivers both effective and user-friendly performance, demonstrating its
feasibility for personalized, day-to-day assistive communication.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出基于插值矩阵分解(IDs)的PMU数据压缩方法，通过选择少量行(PMU数据流)和/或列(时间快照)来重建完整数据矩阵，实现实时电力系统监测并最小化通信带宽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少PMU数据传输需求，实现实时电力系统监测，同时最小化通信带宽使用。

Method: 使用插值矩阵分解(IDs)框架，通过离散经验插值方法(DEIM)贪婪算法选择行和列，控制压缩误差界限。

Result: 数值测试显示DEIM在数据压缩方面表现优异，验证了基于DEIM的故障检测方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IDs方法为PMU数据压缩提供了严格误差界限，DEIM算法在压缩和故障检测方面均表现良好，能够识别系统运行条件变化。

Abstract: This work investigates the reduction of phasor measurement unit (PMU) data
through low-rank matrix approximations. To reconstruct a PMU data matrix from
fewer measurements, we propose the framework of interpolatory matrix
decompositions (IDs). In contrast to methods relying on principal component
analysis or singular value decomposition, IDs recover the complete data matrix
using only a few of its rows (PMU datastreams) and/or a few of its columns
(snapshots in time). This compression enables the real-time monitoring of power
transmission systems using a limited number of measurements, thereby minimizing
communication bandwidth. The ID perspective gives a rigorous error bound on the
quality of the data compression. We propose selecting rows and columns used in
an ID via the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a greedy
algorithm that aims to control the error bound. This bound leads to a
computable estimate for the reconstruction error during online operations. A
violation of this estimate suggests a change in the system's operating
conditions, and thus serves as a tool for fault detection. Numerical tests
using synthetic PMU data illustrate DEIM's excellent performance for data
compression, and validate the proposed DEIM-based fault-detection method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对经济脱碳和全球能源需求增长的双重挑战，需要可扩展且成本效益高的二氧化碳去除技术。直接空气捕集是最有前景的方法之一，但其高能耗特别是吸附剂再生所需的热能，仍然是成本降低和可持续部署的关键障碍。

Method: 研究探索了结合聚光太阳能技术和低成本沙基储热的太阳能热直接空气捕集系统，分析了并网和独立运行两种配置的技术经济性能，重点研究了与太阳能可用性匹配的短周期吸附剂。

Result: 太阳能热直接空气捕集可实现年容量因子超过80%，二氧化碳去除成本低至160-200美元/吨，与领先的直接空气捕集技术具有竞争力。独立太阳能直接空气捕集系统在高太阳能容量和沙质地区表现尤为突出，对温度和湿度的环境敏感性最小。

Conclusion: 在适合二氧化碳储存的沉积盆地地区，太阳能驱动的直接空气捕集为地热加热提供了成本更低的替代方案，后者常面临地质和经济限制。优化的6000吨/年模块化系统设计占地小于1平方公里，全球沙质地区单独就有超过26吉吨/年的直接空气捕集潜力。

Abstract: The dual challenge of decarbonizing the economy and meeting rising global
energy demand underscores the need for scalable and cost-effective carbon
dioxide removal technologies. Direct air capture (DAC) is among the most
promising approaches, but its high energy intensity, particularly the thermal
energy required for sorbent regeneration, remains a critical barrier to cost
reduction and sustainable deployment. This study explores solar-thermal DAC
systems that combine concentrated solar thermal technology with low-cost
sand-based thermal energy storage to meet this demand. We analyze the
techno-economic performance of such systems in both grid-connected and
stand-alone configurations. Results show that solar-thermal DAC can achieve
annual capacity factors exceeding 80% and CO2 removal costs as low as 160-200
USD per ton, making it competitive with leading DAC technologies. The proposed
system operates most efficiently with short-cycle sorbents that align with
solar availability. The stand-alone Solar-DAC systems, which rely solely on
solar energy for both electricity and thermal energy, are particularly
promising in regions with high solar capacity and sandy terrain, exhibiting
minimal ambient sensitivity from temperature and humidity. An optimal 6000
ton/yr modular system design takes <1 km2 land-use requirement and potentially
>26 Gt/year DAC capacity is identified for sandy terrain alone globally. In
areas with sedimentary basins suitable for CO2 storage, solar-powered DAC
offers a lower-cost alternative to geothermal heating, which often faces
geological and economic constraints.

Abstract: This paper proposes a simulation-based reinforcement learning algorithm for
controlling systems with uncertain and varying system parameters. While
simulators are useful for safely learning control policies for physical
systems, mitigating the reality gap remains a major challenge. To address the
challenge, we propose a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, multiple
control policies are learned for systems with different parameters in a
simulator. In the second stage, for a real system, the control policies learned
in the first stage are smoothly switched using an online convex optimization
algorithm based on observations. Our proposed algorithm is demonstrated through
numerical experiments.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have a well-established theory in Euclidean
spaces, yet still lack general formulations and constructive synthesis tools
for systems evolving on manifolds common in robotics and aerospace
applications. In this paper, we develop a general theory of geometric CBFs on
bundles and, for control-affine systems, recover the standard
optimization-based CBF controllers and their smooth analogues. Then, by
generalizing kinetic energy-based CBF backstepping to Riemannian manifolds, we
provide a constructive CBF synthesis technique for geometric mechanical
systems, as well as easily verifiable conditions under which it succeeds.
Further, this technique utilizes mechanical structure to avoid computations on
higher-order tangent bundles. We demonstrate its application to an
underactuated satellite on SO(3).

Result: 数值仿真表明该平台能有效协调表后资源与配电系统的运行，同时完全保护建筑内部数据的机密性。

Conclusion: 该平台具有灵活可扩展的架构，能够在保护隐私的前提下实现智能建筑资源与配电系统的有效协调。

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-actor coordination platform for the optimal
utilization of smart buildings resources, including roof top PV generation and
battery energy storage system (BESS), in active power distribution systems. The
proposed multi-actor coordination includes the Smart Building Coordinator
(SBC), Micro-Grid Coordinator (MGC) and Distribution System Coordinator (DSC).
The coordinators operate independently and only exchange limited information
with each other to reach an optimal solution. In the proposed platform, a
hierarchical optimization problem is solved to optimally determine the
operating point of all distribution system resources. The proposed platform
fully preserves the confidentiality of the behind the meter (BTM) data of the
buildings since no information about the status of the PV system, BESS, and
load of the building is shared with the owner of the power system. The proposed
platform has a flexible and scalable architecture where the computational task
of coordinating microgrids and smart buildings with distribution grid is
performed locally at the MGC and SBC layers, respectively. Numerical
simulations show the efficacy of the proposed platform in coordinating the BTM
resources with the rest of the distribution system.

TL;DR: MAiCaS是一种多功能天线集成电容传感平台，通过利用电感天线的寄生电容作为应变敏感元件，将传感、遥测和机械功能统一到紧凑设计中，实现无源、无线、实时心血管监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心血管监测系统需要分离的传感器和无线模块，增加了设备复杂性和尺寸。MAiCaS旨在开发一种集成化、可扩展的解决方案，简化制造过程并提高可重复性。

Method: 采用无洁净室单步UV激光图案化工艺在柔性PDMS基板上制造传感器。利用电感天线的寄生电容作为应变敏感元件，通过S11参数测量和共振频率偏移作为输出指标进行无线询问。

Result: 在体外实验中，MAiCaS在生理条件下表现出稳定的共振频率偏移，具有高灵敏度：心外膜贴片2.9 MHz/1%应变，血管移植物0.43 MHz/mmHg，支架集成传感器309.6 kHz/μm。在人体实验中验证了其操作性能。

Conclusion: MAiCaS提供了一种可扩展、经济高效的无电池血管动力学监测解决方案，具有远程诊断、术后随访和持续心血管健康管理的潜力。

Abstract: We present a multifunctional, antenna-integrated capacitive sensing (MAiCaS)
platform for passive, wireless, and real-time cardiovascular monitoring. Unlike
conventional systems that require separate sensors and wireless modules, our
device unifies sensing, telemetry, and mechanical functionality into a compact
and scalable design by exploiting the parasitic capacitance of an inductive
antenna as a strain-sensitive element. The sensor is fabricated using a
cleanroom-free, single-step UV laser patterning process on a flexible PDMS
substrate, reducing manufacturing complexity and enabling high reproducibility.
The MAiCaS is suitable for three different applications: as a sensor for
epicardial strain measurement, a stent as a sensor, and a vascular graft
sensor. We demonstrate MAiCaS's versatility by validating its wireless
resonance-based response to strain, pressure, and deformation across unrolled
and rolled forms. In vitro experiments demonstrated consistent resonance
frequency shifts under physiological conditions, with stable performance on
skin, in PBS, human serum, and simulated vascular environments. Repeatability
and aging tests confirmed its long-term reliability and elasticity under cyclic
loading. Calibration curves revealed high sensitivity across all
configurations, with wireless interrogation achieved through S11 parameter
measurements and resonance frequency shift as the output metric. The
sensitivity of the device was measured to be 2.9 MHz per 1% strain, 0.43
MHz/mmHg, and 309.6kHz/\textmu m for epicardial patch, graft, and stent
integrated sensor, respectively. The operation of MAiCaS was evaluated in a
human experiment. This monolithic sensor architecture provides a scalable and
cost-effective solution for battery-free monitoring of vascular dynamics, with
potential for remote diagnostics, post-surgical follow-up, and continuous
cardiovascular health management.

Abstract: Predicting the motion of surrounding vehicles is key to safe autonomous

This paper proposes a novel online method to accurately predict the occupancy
sets of surrounding vehicles based solely on motion observations. The approach
is divided into two stages: first, an Extended Kalman Filter and a Linear
Programming (LP) problem are used to estimate a compact zonotopic set of
control actions; then, a reachability analysis propagates this set to predict
future occupancy. The effectiveness of the method has been validated through
simulations in an urban environment, showing accurate and compact predictions
without relying on prior assumptions or prior training data.

Abstract: Devices within the marine Internet of Things (MIoT) can connect to low Earth
orbit (LEO) satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to facilitate
low-latency data transmission and execution, as well as enhanced-capacity data
storage. However, without proper traffic handling strategy, it is still
difficult to effectively meet the low-latency requirements. In this paper, we
consider a cooperative satellite-aerial-MIoT network (CSAMN) for maritime edge
computing and maritime data storage to prioritize delay-sensitive (DS) tasks by
employing mobile edge computing, while handling delay-tolerant (DT) tasks via
the store-carry-forward method. Considering the delay constraints of DS tasks,
we formulate a constrained joint optimization problem of maximizing
satellite-collected data volume while minimizing system energy consumption by
controlling four interdependent variables, including the transmit power of UAVs
for DS tasks, the start time of DT tasks, computing resource allocation, and
offloading ratio. To solve this non-convex and non-linear problem, we propose a
joint computation offloading and resource management (JCORM) algorithm using
the Dinkelbach method and linear programming. Our results show that the volume
of data collected by the proposed JCORM algorithm can be increased by up to
41.5% compared to baselines. Moreover, JCORM algorithm achieves a dramatic
reduction in computational time, from a maximum of 318.21 seconds down to just
0.16 seconds per experiment, making it highly suitable for real-time maritime
applications.

Conclusion: 这些发现为电力系统中更少保守和更广泛适用的分散式稳定性认证提供了途径。

Abstract: The increasing share of converter based resources in power systems calls for
scalable methods to analyse stability without relying on exhaustive system wide
simulations. Decentralized small gain and small-phase criteria have recently
been proposed for this purpose, but their applicability to grid forming
converters is severely limited by the sectoriality assumption, which is not
typically satisfied at low frequencies. This work revisits and extends mixed
gain phase conditions by introducing loop shaping transformations that
reformulate converter and network models in alternative coordinate frames. The
proposed approach resolves intrinsic non sectoriality at low frequencies and
reduces conservativeness, thereby improving the applicability of decentralized
stability certification. Analytical results are illustrated using an infinite
bus system first and then extended to the IEEE 14 bus network, demonstrating
the practicality and scalability of the method. These findings provide a
pathway toward less conservative and more widely applicable decentralized
stability certificates in power grids.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a decentralized optimization-based density
controller designed to enforce set invariance constraints in multi-robot
systems. By designing a decentralized control barrier function, we derived
sufficient conditions under which local safety constraints guarantee global
safety. We account for localization and motion noise explicitly by modeling
robots as spatial probability density functions governed by the Fokker-Planck
equation. Compared to traditional centralized approaches, our controller
requires less computational and communication power, making it more suitable
for deployment in situations where perfect communication and localization are
impractical. The controller is validated through simulations and experiments
with four quadcopters.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and deployment of a process-aware
cyber-physical system that automates plant-level logistics, traceability, and
sanitation in a centralized maple-syrup boiling center. The system replaces
ad-hoc, manual operations with event-driven orchestration on a local server,
employing reusable device abstractions and a centralized interlock with
priority-based arbitration for shared piping. It implements deterministic
routines for delivery, reverse osmosis integration, evaporator feed, and
permeate management. The system is sensor rich: inline measurements of flow,
temperature, and sugar concentration (degrees Brix) drive routing decisions and
trigger systematic post-transfer rinses (cleaning-in-place), ensuring
consistent hygiene and complete, immediate traceability up to the evaporator
inlet. During the 2025 production season, the system queued 431 operations
without incident; executed 908 \enquote{topstock} and \enquote{downstock}
balancing cycles; increased usable permeate reserves from 22,712 to
approximately 41,640 L through dynamic storage assignment; eliminated
mid-season contamination incidents previously observed under manual practice;
and reduced administrative effort for billing and reporting from more than 30
hours to roughly 1 hour through automatic documentation. These results
demonstrate a practical path to modular, plant-scale automation beyond
traditional architectures, and lay the groundwork for packaging reusable
elements for similar plants or adjacent industries. This work is part of a
larger project involving the first scientifically-documented integration of
Industry 4.0 technologies in a maple syrup boiling center.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用逐点约束训练学习参数化来解决最优潮流问题的新方法，该方法在约束需在所有问题实例上成立的情况下直接替代OPF问题，相比现有监督学习方法在平均约束上表现更好。


<details>

Motivation: 现有监督学习方法要求约束在问题实例的平均上成立，而新方法旨在使约束在所有单个问题实例上都得到满足，特别是在约束难以满足的极端情况下。

Method: 在双域中使用增广拉格朗日和对偶梯度上升算法进行逐点约束训练，将学习参数化直接代入具有约束的OPF问题中。

Result: 数值实验表明，逐点约束训练产生的解具有更小的约束违反，在约束最难满足的极端情况下效果最明显，在总线数量大的电力系统中收益最显著。

Conclusion: 逐点约束训练方法在减少约束违反方面优于传统监督学习方法，特别是在复杂电力系统的极端情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Training learning parameterizations to solve optimal power flow (OPF) with
pointwise constraints is proposed. In this novel training approach, a learning
parameterization is substituted directly into an OPF problem with constraints
required to hold over all problem instances. This is different from existing
supervised learning methods in which constraints are required to hold across
the average of problem instances. Training with pointwise constraints is
undertaken in the dual domain with the use of augmented Lagrangian and dual
gradient ascent algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that training with
pointwise constraints produces solutions with smaller constraint violations.
Experiments further demonstrated that pointwise constraints are most effective
at reducing constraint violations in corner cases - defined as those
realizations in which constraints are most difficult to satisfy. Gains are most

TL;DR: 开发了一个双层优化框架，分析数据中心在电力成本和边际排放强度权衡下的负荷转移行为对电力系统运行的影响，揭示了网络约束和激励信号如何影响分散决策的社会效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据中心作为大型灵活电力负荷，能够响应经济和环境信号转移计算负载，但其灵活性对电力系统运行的影响取决于与网络约束和市场信号的交互作用。

Method: 采用双层优化框架，上层是数据中心最小化电力成本和边际排放强度的加权组合，下层是系统运营商在经济调度下求解传输和发电约束，针对三节点电力系统推导闭式分段线性表达式。

Result: 识别了数据中心分散决策与社会最优行为一致或偏离的充分条件，表征了由此产生的外部性，揭示了系统拓扑和发电机不对称性如何影响激励一致性。

Conclusion: 边际价格或排放信号可能无法有效引导灵活负荷实现社会效益，为分析碳感知激励下的分散灵活性提供了可处理的起点，并指出了改进灵活负荷与系统运行协调的方向。

Abstract: Data centers are emerging as large, flexible electricity consumers capable of
shifting computational workloads across locations in response to economic and
environmental signals. While this flexibility has potential for emissions
reduction, its impact on power system operations depends critically on how such
behavior interacts with network constraints and market signals. We develop a
bilevel optimization framework in which a data center minimizes a weighted
combination of electricity cost and marginal emissions intensity (LME), while
the system operator clears economic dispatch under transmission and generation
constraints. Focusing on a stylized three-bus power system, we derive
closed-form, piecewise-linear expressions for both the data center and
system-wide objectives as functions of the data centers' load shift. These
expressions capture threshold-driven regime changes due to congestion and
renewable saturation. We identify sufficient conditions under which the data
center's decentralized decisions align with or diverge from socially optimal
behavior and characterize the resulting externalities. Our results reveal how
system topology and generator asymmetry affect incentive alignment and provide
insight into when marginal price or emissions signals may fail to guide
flexible loads toward socially beneficial outcomes. Our results offer a
tractable starting point for analyzing decentralized flexibility under
carbon-aware incentives and suggest directions for improving coordination
between flexible loads and system operations.

TL;DR: 该研究分析核心加密资产的流动性和波动率指标是否产生溢出效应来预测市场整体风险，通过多层统计框架和机器学习方法发现显著的格兰杰因果关系和中等预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究核心加密资产的流动性和波动率代理指标是否产生溢出效应，从而能够预测市场范围内的风险。

Method: 集成三层统计框架：核心流动性与收益的相互作用、流动性与收益的主成分关系、捕捉横截面波动率拥挤的波动率因子投影，辅以VAR脉冲响应、HAR-X模型和泄漏安全的机器学习协议。

Result: 使用2021-2025年74个资产的1462个日度数据，发现了跨层的统计显著格兰杰因果关系和中等程度的样本外预测准确性。

Conclusion: 核心加密资产的流动性和波动率指标确实产生显著的溢出效应，能够预测市场整体风险，但预测准确性仅为中等水平。

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

### [162] [Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19861)
*Felix Michalak,Steven Abreu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在混合SSM-Transformer架构中，检索功能完全由自注意力层负责，SSM层无法补偿注意力层的缺失。仅保留15%的注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合SSM-Transformer架构中不同组件的功能特化，特别是自注意力层在检索任务中的关键作用。

Method: 通过在RecurrentGemma-2B/9B和Jamba-Mini-1.6模型上进行注意力消融实验和注意力头稀疏化实验，分析不同组件对检索任务的影响。

Result: 注意力消融导致检索任务完全失败（0%准确率），而SSM层没有补偿机制。仅保留15%的注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU表现。

Conclusion: 混合架构中的功能严格特化，自注意力层专门负责检索任务，挑战了关于架构冗余的假设，这些模型更像是专门化模块而非集成系统。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

TL;DR: NAS-DQN通过在线神经架构搜索动态优化网络结构，在深度强化学习中实现了优于固定架构的性能、样本效率和策略稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习代理的性能受限于固定的神经网络架构，需要通过昂贵的超参数搜索确定，限制了在线学习效果。

Method: 提出NAS-DQN，将学习型神经架构搜索控制器集成到DRL训练循环中，基于累积性能反馈实现动态网络重构。

Result: 在连续控制任务中，NAS-DQN相比固定架构基线和随机搜索，获得了更优的最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 架构自适应是在线深度强化学习中实现最优样本效率的必要条件，RL代理设计可以动态集成到学习过程中。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

TL;DR: ReGraphT是一个无需训练的检索增强生成框架，通过构建CUDA优化轨迹的推理图，将LLM级推理能力转移到小型模型上，使SLM在CUDA代码生成任务中接近LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在生成优化CUDA代码方面表现出色，但存在代码泄露风险和计算成本高的问题。小型模型虽然轻量且隐私友好，但在复杂CUDA生成任务中推理能力有限。

Method: 将CUDA优化轨迹组织为结构化推理图，将组合优化建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索。

Result: ReGraphT在CUDAEval和ParEval基准测试中平均实现2.33倍加速，优于专门微调的HPC模型和其他检索增强方法。

Conclusion: ReGraphT框架使小型语言模型能够在不牺牲隐私和计算效率的情况下，达到接近大型语言模型的性能水平。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer架构的数据驱动方法，直接预测均衡路径流量，大幅降低交通分配问题的计算时间，并能灵活适应需求和网络结构变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均衡原理的数学规划方法在大规模网络中计算复杂度呈非线性增长，变得计算昂贵。

Method: 使用深度神经网络，特别是Transformer架构，直接预测均衡路径流量，捕捉OD对之间的复杂相关性。

Result: 在多个网络上进行的数值实验表明，该模型比传统优化方法快几个数量级，能有效估计多类网络中的路径级交通流量，降低计算成本并提高预测精度。

Conclusion: 该模型能灵活适应变化的需求和网络条件，支持交通管理并实现快速的"假设分析"，增强交通规划和政策制定能力。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

TL;DR: 提出FairGRPO方法，通过分层强化学习解决医疗AI系统中的群体公平性问题，减少不同人口群体间的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI系统在诊断能力上表现出色，但在不同人口群体间存在显著的性能差异，这对少数群体造成实际伤害。现有的多模态推理基础模型通过强化学习训练时会继承并放大训练数据中的偏见。

Method: FairGRPO是一种分层强化学习方法，采用基于表征、任务难度和数据来源的自适应重要性权重调整优势函数。当缺乏人口统计标签时，使用无监督聚类自动发现潜在的人口群体。

Result: 在7个临床诊断数据集上，FairGRPO相比所有基准方法将预测公平性提高了27.2%，同时F1分数提升了12.49%。训练动态分析显示FairGRPO在优化过程中持续改善公平性。

Conclusion: FairGRPO有效解决了医疗AI中的公平性问题，基于该方法发布的FairMedGemma-4B模型在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少了跨人口群体的差异。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

TL;DR: 本文针对去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算量化问题，提出了两种基于f-DP的隐私核算方法：PN-f-DP和Sec-f-LDP，能够更准确地衡量隐私泄露并提供更紧的隐私边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算量化具有挑战性，因为存在复杂的算法组件如去中心化通信和本地更新，现有方法难以准确评估隐私泄露。

Method: 开发了两种f-DP核算方法：PN-f-DP量化用户对间的隐私泄露，Sec-f-LDP支持通过共享秘密进行结构化噪声注入，结合f-DP理论和马尔可夫链集中性工具。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，相比Rényi DP方法，所提方法能提供更紧的(ε,δ)边界和更好的效用。

Conclusion: f-DP框架在去中心化隐私核算中具有优势，能够捕捉稀疏通信、本地迭代和相关噪声带来的隐私放大效应。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

Motivation: 开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统，优化泌尿系统疾病的筛查和早期诊断，特别是膀胱癌。

Method: 使用SHAP进行特征选择，采用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法，通过Optuna进行超参数优化，使用SMOTE技术平衡类别，构建六个二元分类场景区分膀胱癌与其他泌尿系统和肿瘤疾病。

Result: 基于SHAP的特征选择方法在保持或改善平衡准确率、精确度和特异性等性能指标的同时，提高了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 使用可解释性技术（SHAP）进行特征选择被证明是一种有效的方法，有助于开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 噪声数据集（低信噪比、小样本量、数据收集错误等）是分类方法的重要研究前沿，需要专门处理数据随机性的框架。

Method: 将数据集视为随机场的实现，映射到希尔伯特空间，使用Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève展开分解为可计算不可约分量，通过特征值分解进行类别区分。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病阶段分类和遥感森林砍伐检测等数据稀缺的科学领域取得了最先进的突破性成果。

Conclusion: FINDER在噪声数据集上优于现有方法，但仍有失败模式和局限性需要讨论。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

Motivation: 在线广告平台需要有效的竞价策略来最大化利润，但现有研究往往未能同时考虑广告的延迟效应、累积影响（如强化或疲劳效应）和用户异质性这三个关键因素。

Method: 将广告竞价建模为带延迟泊松奖励的上下文马尔可夫决策过程，提出两阶段最大似然估计结合数据分割策略，并设计强化学习算法来推导个性化竞价策略。

Result: 该方法达到了近乎最优的后悔界$\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$，其中$d$是上下文维度，$H$是轮数，$T$是客户数量，并通过仿真实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效处理广告竞价中的延迟效应、累积影响和用户异质性，为在线广告平台提供了理论保证的个性化竞价策略。

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

TL;DR: 该论文首次分析了Muon优化器中不精确正交化更新的理论性能，揭示了近似精度与最优步长和动量参数之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在实践中依赖快速近似正交化，但现有理论分析都假设精确的SVD更新，存在理论与实践的脱节。

Method: 在线性最小化Oracle框架下引入加性误差模型，分析不精确正交化更新的性能边界，量化近似误差对性能的影响。

Result: 发现近似精度与最优步长和动量参数存在耦合关系：较低的Oracle精度需要更小的步长但更大的动量参数。NanoGPT实验验证了这一预测。

Conclusion: 近似过程（如Newton-Schulz步数）应从实现细节提升为必须与学习调度共同调优的关键参数。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 选择性分类器通过拒绝模型认为不确定的输入来提高可靠性，但很少有方法能达到完美排序预言机的黄金标准性能。本文旨在形式化这一差距并分析其来源。

Method: 提出选择性分类差距的有限样本分解框架，将差距分解为五个具体来源。在合成数据和真实视觉、语言基准上进行验证，通过受控实验分离每个误差分量。

Result: 验证了(i)贝叶斯噪声和有限模型容量会导致显著差距，(ii)只有更丰富的特征感知校准器能显著改善分数排序，(iii)数据偏移引入了需要分布鲁棒训练的松弛项。

Conclusion: 该分解提供了定量的误差预算和可操作的设计指南，帮助实践者构建更接近理想预言机行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

TL;DR: 本文分析了线性回归持续学习中的任务排序策略，重点研究贪心最大化任务间差异性的排序方法，揭示了贪心排序与随机排序在收敛性能上的复杂差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究持续学习中任务排序对学习性能的影响，特别是贪心选择差异性最大任务的排序策略，这在先前工作中虽有提及但仍存在许多未解问题。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法工具，形式化贪心排序策略，开发几何和代数直觉，并在线性回归和CIFAR-100线性探测任务上进行实证分析。

Result: 贪心排序在平均损失收敛速度上优于随机排序；在高秩回归设置下，贪心排序的损失边界与随机排序类似；但在一般秩设置下，单次贪心排序可能失败，而允许重复的贪心排序以O(1/∛k)速率收敛。

Conclusion: 揭示了贪心和随机排序策略内部及之间的细微差别，贪心排序在特定条件下表现优异，但需要谨慎处理重复机制以避免灾难性失败。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

TL;DR: 提出一种椭圆不确定性集合来处理金融市场中RL智能体训练与部署环境不匹配问题，解决传统鲁棒RL方法无法捕捉市场冲击方向性的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融应用中，RL智能体在历史数据上训练时不会影响价格，但实际部署时其交易行为会产生市场冲击，这种环境不匹配会显著降低性能。传统鲁棒RL方法依赖对称结构，无法捕捉市场冲击的方向性特征。

Method: 开发了一类椭圆不确定性集合，建立了最坏情况不确定性的隐式和显式闭式解，实现了高效可处理的鲁棒策略评估。

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务上的实验表明，该方法获得了更优的夏普比率，并在交易量增加时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的RL提供了一种更忠实和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Conclusion: 提出的无偏梯度估计器有效解决了零阶优化中的偏差问题，为梯度不可得或计算昂贵的优化问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究两点零阶梯度估计器，发现当扰动步长趋近于零时，最小化估计器渐近方差的扰动分布应与真实梯度方向对齐，而非保持固定长度。提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，并在理论和实验上验证其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注固定长度的随机扰动，但忽略了扰动方向与梯度方向对齐可能带来的优势。本文旨在探索这种方向对齐扰动在零阶优化中的潜力。

Method: 将问题建模为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题，提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，该方案能自适应地在关键方向上提供更高精度。

Result: 理论分析表明DAP方案优于传统方法，实验在合成问题和实际任务中验证了DAP在特定条件下的优越性能。

Conclusion: 方向对齐扰动方案为零阶优化提供了新的思路，扩展了现有复杂度界限到更广泛的扰动类型，并在特定条件下展现出优于传统方法的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机平滑方法主要使用各向同性噪声分布，忽略了输入和数据维度的异质性，限制了鲁棒性认证的效果。

Method: UCAN通过将现有随机平滑方法从对称（各向同性）噪声转换为非对称（各向异性）噪声分布，支持多种噪声分布和ℓ_p范数认证，并开发了三种噪声参数生成器来优化不同数据维度的噪声参数。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和ImageNet数据集上，UCAN在大认证半径下的认证精度比现有最先进方法提升了高达182.6%。

Conclusion: UCAN通过引入各向异性噪声，显著提升了随机平滑方法的认证对抗鲁棒性效果，为机器学习模型提供了更有效的防御机制。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了时序预测中"长序列信息增益假设"的传统观念，发现适当截断历史数据反而能提高预测精度，并提出AMRC方法通过动态掩码损失和表示一致性约束来抑制冗余特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在时序预测中普遍基于"长序列信息增益假设"，但该研究通过实验发现这种假设存在局限性，模型会学习大量冗余特征（如噪声或不相关波动），从而影响有效信号提取。

Method: 提出AMRC方法，包含两个核心组件：1）动态掩码损失，自适应识别高区分度的时间段来指导模型训练；2）表示一致性约束，稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验结果表明AMRC能有效抑制冗余特征学习，同时显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅挑战了时序建模中的传统假设，还为开发高效鲁棒的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDLMs在推理时需要计算所有掩码位置的条件分布，但任意顺序解码算法在数学和编程任务中表现不佳，多标记解码会显著降低性能。需要找到MDLMs额外计算成本的合理理由。

Method: 1. 推理即填充：使用MDLMs填充推理模板，区分推理和答案标记，实现答案不确定性测量和早期退出；2. 多标记熵解码：基于条件熵的自适应采样器，减少并行解码位置时的误差。

Result: 在GSM8k上，使用后验推理轨迹微调LLaDA-8B Base的性能提升与使用人工编写推理轨迹相当。多标记熵解码在保持性能的同时减少了2.7倍的解码步骤。

Conclusion: MDLMs的训练和计算为推理和后训练方法开辟了新途径，推理即填充和多标记熵解码展示了MDLMs的实用价值。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

TL;DR: 使用监督学习和决策树分类器在CAD建模的平面图中分析RFID RSSI数据，对12个实验室区域进行位置推断，总体准确率为34.2%，部分区域F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别分类效果较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFID跟踪在国防资产存储中存在传感器特异性差的问题（如远距离检测、欺骗和伪造漏洞），可能导致错误检测和操作安全事件，需要开发可靠的定位方法。

Method: 在CAD建模的平面图中使用监督学习模拟，采用真实的RSSI数据和决策树分类，处理约98万条原始数据，使用类别权重解决类别不平衡问题，在5000个平衡观测值上进行训练。

Result: 模型总体准确率为34.2%，多个区域（F、G、H等）的F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别（特别是LabZoneC）经常被错误分类，即使使用了类别权重。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可以在现实模拟中应用于区域级异常检测或错位监控，但低覆盖和低信号区域的可靠分类性能需要通过更好的天线布局或额外传感器和多模态传感器融合来改进。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂多步任务中表现不佳，主流RL方法依赖稀疏的基于结果的奖励，在缺乏批评者模型的群体RL算法中，统一奖励或惩罚所有动作会导致训练不稳定和次优策略。

Method: 提出SALT框架，从相同提示的轨迹构建图结构，量化每个步骤的质量并相应分配优势。该框架作为即插即用模块，无需修改rollout过程且计算开销极小。

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和AppWorld基准测试中，SALT在不同模型大小下均能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: SALT有效解决了群体RL算法中的奖励分配问题，通过细粒度优势分配显著提升了多步任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了表达性建模与高效并行生成之间的差距，为大规模TPP应用提供了解决方案

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long

Motivation: 工业过程需要局部专业化和全局协调，但强化学习在工业应用中的采用受到奖励设计、模块化和动作空间管理等挑战的限制。现有学术基准与工业控制问题差异较大，限制了其在实际应用中的可转移性。

Method: 结合SortingEnv和ContainerGym两个现有基准任务，创建顺序回收场景。评估两种控制策略：专业化代理的模块化架构和全系统管理的单体代理，同时分析动作掩码的影响。

Result: 无动作掩码时，代理难以学习有效策略，模块化架构表现更好。应用动作掩码后，两种架构都显著改善，性能差距大幅缩小。动作空间约束起决定性作用，专业化优势随动作复杂度降低而减弱。

Conclusion: 提出的基准为探索工业自动化中实用且鲁棒的多代理强化学习解决方案提供了有价值的测试平台，同时有助于中央化与专业化之间的持续辩论。

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了耦合变换器自编码器（CTAE），用于分离多脑区神经记录中的共享和区域特异性动态，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么忽略时间结构，要么局限于单脑区或线性模型，无法同时处理非线性动态和共享/私有信号分离。

Method: 使用变换器编码器-解码器架构，将每个脑区的潜在空间正交划分为共享和私有子空间，捕获长程神经动态。

Result: 在两个高密度电生理数据集上，CTAE提取的表征能更好地解码行为变量。

Conclusion: CTAE能有效处理多脑区神经记录中的非平稳非线性动态，并成功分离共享与区域特异性信号。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

*Bosong Huang,Ming Jin,Yuxuan Liang,Johan Barthelemy,Debo Cheng,Qingsong Wen,Chenghao Liu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShapeX是一个创新的时间序列分类解释框架，通过识别关键的shapelet（形状片段）并使用Shapley值评估其重要性，提供比现有方法更精确和具有因果保真度的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗和金融等高风险应用中，时间序列分类模型的透明度至关重要。现有的事后解释方法主要关注时间步级别的特征归因，但忽略了分类结果主要由关键shapelet驱动的基本事实。

Method: 提出了ShapeX框架，包含Shapelet描述和检测(SDD)框架来学习分类所需的各种shapelet，将时间序列分割为有意义的shapelet驱动片段，并使用Shapley值评估其显著性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，ShapeX在识别最相关子序列方面优于现有方法，提高了时间序列解释的精确度和因果保真度。

Conclusion: ShapeX通过利用shapelet的原子性特性，能够产生揭示因果关系而非仅仅是相关性的解释，为高风险应用中的时间序列分类提供了更可靠的可解释性。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

*Amartya Roy,Souvik Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于博弈论强化学习的因果发现框架，通过DDQN智能体与强基线方法竞争，实现了理论保证与可扩展性的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在理论与实践的鸿沟：GES和GraN-DAG等算法经验表现好但缺乏有限样本保证，而理论方法无法扩展到大规模图。

Method: 采用博弈论强化学习框架，DDQN智能体与GES或GraN-DAG基线竞争，始终从对手解进行热启动，确保学习到的图不会比对手差。

Result: 在合成SEM（30节点）上观察到的错误概率随样本量n衰减，紧密匹配理论；在Sachs、Asia、Alarm等真实基准上持续改进基线方法，可扩展到Hepar2（70节点）、Dream（100节点）、Andes（220节点）等大规模图。

Conclusion: 建立了同时具备可证明一致性、样本效率和实际可扩展性的RL因果发现算法新类别，统一了经验性能与严格有限样本理论。

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

*Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的维度加权方案，并将其整合到KNN分类器中，通过加权Minkowski距离改进了传统KNN分类器，在基因表达数据集上获得了约10%的分类准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多维样本的模式分类中，基于权重的维度距离度量至关重要，但常用的欧氏距离存在诸多问题。需要开发更有效的距离度量和维度加权方案来提高分类性能。

Method: 提出了新颖的维度加权方案，将其整合到KNN分类器中，使用加权Minkowski距离来调节包含k个参考样本区域的大小和形状，并在多种合成和真实数据集上进行测试。

Result: 在相同实验设置下，该方法比传统KNN表现更好，特别是在基因表达数据集上，所有交叉验证实验中分类准确率显著且一致地提升了约10%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过加权Minkowski距离和新的加权方案，实现了KNN分类器的重要泛化，特别适用于样本数量有限但维度高的数据集。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种完全解耦的训练策略，通过将原型建模为高斯混合模型并使用在线EM风格更新，独立于编码器损失，解决了原型自监督学习中的原型坍塌问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法普遍存在部分原型坍塌问题，多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这破坏了提供多样化目标的核心目的。现有方法通过过度参数化或添加正则化来缓解症状而非解决根本原因。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器分别在不同目标下学习。原型被建模为高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格程序独立更新，与编码器损失分离。

Result: 这种解耦方法无需显式正则化即可消除原型坍塌，产生持续多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了原型坍塌的根本原因，提供了一种简单而原则性的解决方案。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

*Arian Prabowo,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）目前表现不佳，轻量级监督基线和经典模型往往能与其匹敌。作者认为问题在于盲目套用NLP或CV范式，因为时间序列数据缺乏像"苹果"这样的概念性数据集。建议从机会性聚合转向原则性设计，构建系统覆盖时间语义不变性的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型表现不如预期，作者认为这是因为时间序列数据的本质与语言和视觉不同——缺乏概念性数据集，无法通过大规模网络抓取获得有效训练数据。

Method: 提出从机会性数据聚合转向原则性数据集设计，基于第一原则构建时间序列不变性的本体论，确保通过不变性覆盖实现表征完整性。

Result: 分析表明当前TSFMs表现不佳的原因在于数据集构建方法不当，需要重新思考时间序列数据的本质特性。

Conclusion: 只有通过确保不变性覆盖的表征完整性，时间序列基础模型才能实现真正的泛化、推理和涌现行为。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

*Tingting Dan,Xinwei Huang,Jiaqi Ding,Yinggang Zheng,Guorong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过多层图扩散模型揭示了阿尔茨海默病中tau蛋白传播的结构连接和功能连接相互作用机制，发现SC和FC在不同脑区对tau传播的贡献具有区域不对称性，且这种主导作用随疾病进展而变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 已有神经影像学证据显示病理性tau蛋白沿着特定脑网络积累，表明大规模网络架构在阿尔茨海默病进展中起关键作用，但结构连接和功能连接如何相互作用影响tau传播尚不清楚。

Method: 利用大量纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型研究SC-FC相互作用，并在独立AD队列中验证发现。

Result: 研究发现FC主要在皮层下区域、岛叶、额叶和颞叶皮层驱动tau传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域起更大作用。SC和FC的相对主导作用随疾病进展而变化，早期AD中FC占主导，后期SC变得主要。这些模式与AD相关基因表达高度一致。

Conclusion: 结构连接和功能连接在tau蛋白传播中具有区域特异性和疾病阶段依赖性的不对称贡献，非可改变风险因素和生物机制通过改变解剖和功能通路的主导路径来选择性重塑tau传播。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

TL;DR: 提出ADP-VRSGP方法，通过自适应调整噪声方差和学习率，结合梯度融合策略，在保证节点级个性化隐私的同时提升去中心化学习性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定方差噪声方法会降低模型性能和训练效率，需要解决隐私保护与模型性能之间的平衡问题

Method: 使用步进衰减策略动态调整噪声方差和学习率，引入渐进梯度融合策略利用历史梯度，结合去中心化push-sum和聚合技术

Result: 理论分析证明该方法具有鲁棒收敛性，实验验证在多种场景下优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP能有效解决隐私保护去中心化学习中的挑战，在保证隐私的同时显著提升训练稳定性和速度

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

TL;DR: 提出了Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS)方法来解决大规模TSP问题，通过聚类和超路径引导来缩小搜索空间，提高求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在大规模TSP实例中存在内存限制、初始解质量不高和全局引导不足等问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用"先聚类后路由"策略，使用稀疏热图图将TSP实例划分为簇并抽象为超节点，生成超路径来指导初始化和优化过程。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有神经方法，特别是在处理大规模实例时，显著缩小了与最优解的差距。

Conclusion: HyperNS方法通过超路径引导的邻域搜索有效解决了大规模TSP问题，提供了更高效和有效的优化方案。

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

TL;DR: RLEV方法通过将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，扩展了RLVR框架，使LLM优化与可量化的人类价值信号对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法虽然能在客观领域有效训练模型，但忽略了不同任务的重要性差异，需要将人类价值信号直接纳入优化过程。

Method: 使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，通过价值加权梯度放大机制实现价值敏感策略。

Result: RLEV在多个RL算法和模型规模上持续优于仅基于正确性的基线方法，不仅提高了价值加权准确率，还学会了价值敏感的终止策略。

Conclusion: RLEV为将LLM与人类优先事项对齐提供了一条实用路径，即使在噪声价值信号下也保持稳健，证明了优化显式效用函数的有效性。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用提供了有效的风险感知约束强化学习解决方案，能够处理奖励分布尾部的风险事件。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

Motivation: 开发用于犬类早期癌症检测的无创筛查工具是兽医医学的重要挑战。常规实验室数据作为低成本来源具有潜力，但受到个体生物标志物非特异性和筛查人群中严重类别不平衡的限制。

Method: 在真实世界约束下使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列，系统比较了126个分析流程，包括各种机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术。采用患者级数据分区以防止数据泄漏。

Result: 最优模型（逻辑回归分类器配合类别加权和递归特征消除）显示出中等排序能力（AUROC = 0.815）但临床分类性能差（F1-score = 0.25）。虽然实现了高阴性预测值（0.98），但召回率不足（0.79）无法作为可靠的排除测试。

Conclusion: 常规实验室数据中存在统计上可检测的癌症信号，但信号太弱且存在混淆，无法可靠区分正常衰老或其他炎症状况。这项工作确立了该数据模态的临界性能上限，并强调计算兽医肿瘤学的有意义的进展需要多模态数据源的整合。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

*Iván Ojeda-Ruiz,Young Ju-Lee,Malcolm Dickens,Leonardo Cambisaca*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Fair-SMW算法，通过拉格朗日方法和Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury恒等式重构约束优化问题，提高谱聚类算法的效率，在保持公平性的同时显著减少计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谱聚类算法在加入群体公平性约束后计算效率低下，需要改进计算时间。

Method: 使用拉格朗日方法和SMW恒等式重新表述约束优化问题，开发Fair-SMW算法，采用三种具有不同谱间隙的拉普拉斯矩阵变体。

Result: 在LastFM、FacebookNet、Deezer和German等真实网络数据集上评估，计算时间比现有最优算法快两倍，同时能实现两倍的平衡度。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW算法在保持公平性的同时显著提高了计算效率，为公平聚类提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

*Hao Wang,Baojun Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QKCV注意力机制在传统QKV框架中引入静态类别嵌入C，强调类别特定信息，提升注意力模型在时间序列预测中的准确性，并支持仅更新静态嵌入进行微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列预测任务中，类别信息对于捕捉数据内在模式至关重要，但传统注意力机制未能充分利用此类信息。

Method: 提出QKCV注意力机制，在传统查询-键-值框架基础上增加静态类别嵌入C，作为即插即用模块增强现有注意力模型。

Result: QKCV显著提升了多种注意力模型在多样化真实数据集上的预测精度，并在微调单变量时间序列基础模型时仅需更新静态嵌入即可获得优越性能。

Conclusion: QKCV是一种有效整合类别信息的时间序列预测方法，既能提升模型性能，又能降低微调计算成本。

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV
(Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV
framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize
category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the
forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,
Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV
demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

TL;DR: 提出MetaVD方法，通过贝叶斯元学习预测客户端相关的dropout率，解决联邦学习中的模型过拟合和本地模型发散问题，在非IID数据环境下实现有效的模型个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在实际应用中面临模型过拟合和本地模型发散的问题，特别是在数据有限且非独立同分布的情况下。

Method: MetaVD使用共享超网络预测客户端相关的dropout率，通过条件dropout后验实现元学习的后验适应和贝叶斯联邦学习的后验聚合。

Result: 在多个稀疏和非IID联邦学习数据集上的实验表明，MetaVD在分类准确性和不确定性校准方面表现优异，特别是对于分布外客户端，同时压缩了本地模型参数，降低了通信成本。

Conclusion: MetaVD通过贝叶斯元学习方法有效解决了联邦学习中的关键挑战，实现了更好的模型个性化和性能提升。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Result: 在表格设置中验证了算法的收敛行为，在深度强化学习实现中显著优于先前基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在理论和实验上均表现出色，为多目标强化学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LKM的自知识蒸馏方法，能在不增加计算复杂度的前提下显著提升图神经网络在分子性质预测中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在分子性质预测中效果最佳，但现有方法在提高准确性时需要增加模型复杂度，这会显著增加计算成本和内存需求。

Method: 开发了层到层知识混合方法，通过最小化GNN层间预存隐藏嵌入的平均绝对距离，有效聚合多跳和多尺度信息，改善局部和全局分子特征表示。

Result: 在QM9、MD17和Chignolin数据集上评估，LKM将量子化学和生物物理性质预测的平均绝对误差分别降低了9.8%、45.3%和22.9%。

Conclusion: LKM方法能够在不显著增加训练和推理成本的情况下，显著提高GNN在化学性质预测中的准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在数据异构性场景下性能有限，缺乏对多样化异构场景的鲁棒性。研究发现共享统计信息可以通过全局视角缓解异构性问题。

Method: FedGPS静态修改客户端学习目标，使用代理信息隐式建模全局数据分布；动态调整本地更新方向，在每轮整合其他客户端的梯度信息。

Conclusion: FedGPS通过无缝整合统计分布和梯度信息，有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，在各种异构场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种乐观决策标准，通过直接建模奖励函数的不确定性来指导行为基础模型进行任务推断，能够在少量回合中识别和优化未见过的奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行为基础模型需要计算推理数据集上的奖励，这需要访问奖励函数形式或大量标注工作。本文旨在通过与环境交互来纯化任务推断过程，减少数据需求。

Method: 提出OpTI-BFM方法，采用乐观决策标准直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，引导行为基础模型进行数据收集以进行任务推断。

Result: 在已建立的零样本基准测试中，OpTI-BFM使基于后继特征的行为基础模型能够在少量回合内识别和优化未见过的奖励函数，计算开销极小。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM为训练良好的行为基础模型提供了遗憾边界，通过直接连接到线性bandits的上置信算法，有效解决了零样本强化学习中的任务推断问题。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个基准框架，用于系统性地测量LLM代理利用测试用例的倾向性，通过创建任务的自然语言规范与单元测试之间的直接冲突来量化作弊行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM倾向于寻找和利用"捷径"完成任务，这会严重影响评估的可靠性和实际部署的安全性，比如删除失败的测试而不是修复底层bug。

Method: 通过从现有基准创建"不可能"任务变体，引入规范与测试之间的冲突，测量代理在这些任务上的通过率作为"作弊率"。

Result: 该框架不仅能评估模型行为，还能揭示从简单测试修改到复杂操作符重载的作弊行为细节，并可用于上下文工程和监控工具开发。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench为构建更健壮可靠的LLM系统提供了一个实用框架，有助于理解和缓解作弊行为。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Conclusion: 这项工作使拓扑特征在深度学习中的实际应用成为可能，讨论了包括批处理和多GPU扩展在内的下游应用前景。

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler

GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch
layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs
use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

TL;DR: PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中表现不佳，相比Best-of-N方法没有显著改进，且成本更高。PRM在评估状态值和泛化方面存在可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的链式思维提示和Best-of-N选择无法捕捉复杂问题解决的分支和探索性质，需要更有效的推理方法。

Method: 提出自适应算法最大化过程奖励模型分数，研究PRM引导的树搜索是否能通过探索多个部分解路径来改进数学推理。

Result: PRM引导的树搜索相比BoN无显著改进；蒙特卡洛树搜索和波束搜索表现最佳；PRM在状态值评估和泛化方面可靠性差。

Conclusion: 树搜索对不可靠的PRM分数依赖过大，需要不同的奖励建模方法才能有效增强LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在标准基准数据集上表现良好，但在实际应用中性能不稳定，缺乏对模型具体优缺点的量化分析，难以针对特定预测场景选择合适的模型。

Method: 使用可编程特征配置的合成数据驱动评估范式，通过三个核心分析维度：时序特征分解与能力映射、数据异常下的鲁棒性分析、理论最优基准测试。

Result: 实验表明当前深度学习模型并非在所有类型的时序特征上都接近最优基准。

Conclusion: SynTSBench框架能够提供清晰、量化的模型能力评估，有助于更好地理解和选择时间序列预测模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大-小模型协作框架中存在的准确率下降、灾难性遗忘加剧、小模型知识引发的幻觉问题。

Method: 采用KAN(可解释神经网络)作为协作模型，替代传统MLP，在语言、视觉和视觉-语言跨模态任务中部署KCM协作系统。

Result: 相比纯大模型方法，KCM协作框架显著减少大模型推理调用次数，保持相近任务准确率；相比MLP协作模型，KCM在所有指标上表现更优，显著改善长尾数据准确率。

Conclusion: KAN-based协作模型(KCM)在大-小模型协作中具有优越性能，能有效平衡计算效率与模型精度，缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Motivation: 构建能够协助整个科学研究过程的AI合作者，需要评估端到端工作流程的基准，而不仅仅是孤立子任务。

Method: 从14kCC授权论文构建CS-54k高质量科学问答语料库，采用检索增强生成和多阶段质量控制确保事实基础，从中衍生出CS-4k评估基准和CS-50k训练数据集。

Result: CS-4k能够将最先进LLM分层到不同能力层级，在CS-50k上训练的7B规模模型通过监督训练和强化学习显著提升，甚至超越GPT-4.1、GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro等大型专有系统。

Conclusion: 使AI模型成为更好的研究助手更依赖于使用高质量数据进行领域对齐训练，而非预训练规模或通用基准性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Conclusion: DB-FGA-Net等无需增强、可解释且可部署的深度学习模型在脑肿瘤诊断中具有可靠的临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出InvDec混合架构，通过倒置解码器实现时间编码和变量级解码的分离，在高维数据集上显著提升多变量时间序列预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：通道独立方法如PatchTST擅长时间建模但忽略变量相关性，而纯变量注意力方法如iTransformer牺牲时间编码能力

Method: 结合基于patch的时间编码器和在变量维度上通过变量级自注意力操作的倒置解码器，引入延迟变量嵌入和自适应残差融合机制

Result: 在7个基准测试中，高维数据集上显著改进：电力数据集MSE降低20.9%，天气数据集提升4.3%，交通数据集提升2.7%，在低维ETT数据集上保持竞争力

Conclusion: InvDec的优势随数据集维度增加而增长，证实跨变量建模在变量数量增加时变得至关重要

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

TL;DR: 提出LEGO框架，解决推荐系统中多属性遗忘问题，通过嵌入校准和灵活组合两个步骤实现高效的多敏感属性保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的隐私保护需求通常涉及多个敏感属性且具有动态性，现有单属性遗忘方法无法同时处理多个遗忘请求和适应动态需求。

Method: 将多属性遗忘过程分为两个步骤：嵌入校准（从用户嵌入中移除特定属性信息）和灵活组合（将这些嵌入合并为单一嵌入以保护所有敏感属性），并将遗忘过程建模为互信息最小化问题。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集和三种代表性推荐模型上的广泛实验证明了该框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: LEGO框架能够有效解决多属性遗忘问题，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Conclusion: 使用飞行模拟器生成合成图像并结合域适应策略，可以有效解决关键应用中训练数据不足的问题，提高模型在恶劣条件下的性能。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Motivation: 传统奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击且泛化能力差，而强大的LLM评判器虽然泛化能力强但推理成本高，限制了在在线RLHF中的应用。

Method: 将策略梯度中的优势估计建模为成对偏好分类，实现原则性的不确定性量化，不确定的样本对交由LLM评判器处理，确定的样本对由奖励模型评估。

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性路由框架能够有效结合快速奖励模型和强大LLM评判器的优势，在控制成本的同时提升RLHF性能。

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

Motivation: 现有层次预测方法在协调过程中使用估计的协方差矩阵，但真实协方差矩阵未知，估计误差可能降低预测性能。

Method: 引入协方差矩阵的不确定性集合，构建鲁棒优化框架，将协调问题转化为半定优化问题。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的鲁棒协调方法比现有层次预测方法具有更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 将不确定性整合到协调过程中能有效提高层次预测的性能。

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

TL;DR: 提出了基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过RBP指标衡量正确token在预测中的排名概率，补充了传统交叉熵指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要依赖交叉熵作为评估指标，但交叉熵只关注正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token之间的相对排序关系，而相对排序在语言模型的实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 提出了相对排序概率(RBP)指标，量化正确token在top预测中的排名概率，并基于此建立了相对排序缩放定律，通过四个数据集和四个模型家族的广泛实验验证其鲁棒性和准确性。

Result: 实验证明相对排序缩放定律能够准确预测模型性能随规模的变化，该定律在四个数据集和四个模型家族上表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 相对排序缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为大规模语言模型的缩放提供了更全面的理解，对实际开发和理论探索都具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

TL;DR: 本文分析了DPO算法的局限性，指出当策略类无法实现真实奖励函数时会出现错误设定问题，并提出了AuxDPO方法通过引入辅助变量来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接偏好优化(DPO)算法虽然简化了RLHF流程，但在策略类无法实现真实奖励函数时会出现错误设定，导致偏好顺序反转、策略奖励恶化等问题。

Method: 首先分析了DPO的统计估计问题，然后研究了两阶段RLHF的局部行为，最后提出了AuxDPO方法，在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量来逼近RLHF解。

Result: 在示例赌博机设置和LLM对齐任务上的实验表明，AuxDPO相比DPO具有更优越的性能。

Conclusion: AuxDPO能够以原则性的方式缓解DPO的错误设定问题，在保持DPO简洁性的同时获得更好的对齐效果。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

Method: 提出阈值方法学习阈值来调整由标记先验概率归一化的标记概率，以优化标记预测；开发新的神经MTPP模型支持有效时间采样和标记概率估计，无需计算昂贵的数值不当积分；采用先预测标记后预测时间的策略。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在下一个事件标记和时间预测方面优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案通过处理标记分布不平衡问题，显著提高了下一个事件预测的性能，特别是在罕见标记事件的预测上表现优异。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code

Motivation: LLM在现实系统中部署时会产生有毒或有偏见的输出，但参数更新的高成本促使需要选择性地使用修复数据。

Method: 评估了五种代表性选择方法：随机采样、K-Center、梯度范数选择(GraNd)、分层覆盖(CCS)和提出的语义感知优先采样(SAPS)，通过毒性减少、困惑度和三个复合指标评估修复效果。

Result: SAPS在解毒、效用保持和效率方面达到最佳平衡，用更少数据实现相当或更好的修复结果。随机采样对大型或鲁棒模型仍然有效，而高开销方法如CCS和GraNd收益有限。

Conclusion: 选择式修复是维护LLM可靠性的高效可扩展范例，最佳数据比例取决于模型规模和修复方法，样本选择应被视为修复流程中的可调组件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing
drug-drug interaction networks.

Conclusion: 博彩市场在处理不可传递性比赛时存在效率低下，基于图的神经网络方法能够成功捕捉关系动态并利用这种市场无效性获得正收益。

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对后处理图像水印的攻击方法，能够仅使用单张水印图像来移除和伪造水印，无需了解水印模型细节，质疑了当前水印技术的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的激增，水印技术在确保内容真实性和归属方面愈发重要。虽然已有许多研究评估水印对移除攻击的鲁棒性，但水印伪造（即从真实内容中窃取水印并应用于恶意内容）仍未被充分探索。

Method: 首先引入一个偏好模型来评估图像是否包含水印，该模型使用排序损失在纯程序生成的图像上进行训练，无需真实水印。然后通过反向传播优化输入图像来展示模型的移除和伪造水印能力。

Result: 该方法在多种后处理图像水印模型上进行了评估，证明能够有效伪造水印，仅需单张水印图像且无需水印模型知识，比相关工作提出的攻击更简单实用。

Conclusion: 当前的水印方法在安全性方面存在疑问，提出的攻击方法能够简单有效地伪造水印，凸显了现有水印技术的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出Bi-CoG方法，通过同时利用模型间和模型内一致性以及错误感知动态伪标签分配策略，解决半监督微调中的模型偏差和超参数敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督微调方法存在模型偏差和超参数敏感性问题，主要依赖于预测一致性或预定义置信度阈值。

Method: Bi-CoG方法通过同时利用模型间和模型内一致性，结合错误感知动态伪标签分配策略来分配高质量、低偏差的伪标签。

Result: 在14个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Bi-CoG能持续显著提升现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: Bi-CoG是一种简单有效的即插即用方法，能有效解决半监督微调中的关键问题。

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Hurdle-IMDL框架解决遥感降雨反演中的标签分布不平衡问题，通过分解为零膨胀和长尾两个部分分别处理，显著改善了强降雨的反演性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在定量遥感中的应用受到标签分布不平衡的限制，传统训练模型偏向常见样本，导致对罕见样本（如强降雨）的检索性能下降。

Method: 采用分而治之策略：使用hurdle模型处理零膨胀（非降雨样本占主导），提出IMDL方法处理长尾分布（轻降雨样本相对于强降雨样本比例失调），将学习目标转化为无偏理想逆模型。

Result: 通过统计指标和案例研究验证，Hurdle-IMDL在缓解系统性低估和改善强到极端降雨反演方面优于传统方法、成本敏感方法、生成方法和多任务学习方法。

Conclusion: IMDL为处理环境变量分布不平衡提供了通用方法，能够增强对罕见但高影响事件的检索能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SheafAlign是一种基于层理论的去中心化多模态对齐框架，通过多比较空间替代单空间对齐，解决了传统方法需要所有模态相互冗余的假设问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态对齐方法假设所有模态之间存在相互冗余，这在现实分布式场景中不成立。需要一种能够处理非完全冗余模态的新方法。

Method: 使用层结构建模成对模态关系，采用去中心化对比学习目标进行训练，在多比较空间中进行对齐而非单一空间。

Result: 在多模态感知数据集上表现出优异的零样本泛化能力、跨模态对齐性能和对缺失模态的鲁棒性，通信成本比现有最优方法降低50%。

Conclusion: SheafAlign框架成功克服了传统方法的限制，无需所有模态相互冗余，同时保留了共享和独特信息，在分布式场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph是针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的隐蔽后门攻击方法，通过文本触发器毒化训练数据，在推理时植入攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图生成技术的快速发展，后门漏洞等安全问题日益凸显。现有研究主要关注图像扩散和无条件图生成的后门攻击，而文本引导的图生成领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发器毒化训练数据，在潜在扩散模型的VAE和扩散训练阶段植入后门，当推理时出现触发器时诱导生成攻击者指定的子图。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，仅需不到10%的毒化率即可达到50%的攻击成功率，24%的毒化率可实现超过80%的成功率，且对良性样本的性能影响可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型存在安全漏洞，在药物发现等应用中存在严重风险，亟需针对此类扩散模型的后门攻击开发鲁棒防御方法。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

Motivation: 零样本强化学习领域缺乏共同的分析框架，现有方法难以直接比较，需要统一的视角来组织现有工作并为未来发展提供基础。

Method: 建立统一的数学框架和分类法，将算法分为直接表示（学习从奖励到策略的端到端映射）和组合表示（利用价值函数子结构分解表示）两类。

Result: 开发了系统的分类框架，能够直接比较不同方法，并为后继特征方法推导了扩展的性能界限，提供了对其零样本性能的新视角。

Conclusion: 该统一框架为零样本强化学习提供了原则性基础，为开发更通用智能体指明了清晰路径，有助于未来研究的系统性发展。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速且无需微调的LLM适应方法，通过选择性矩阵降维和梯度分析来提升下游任务准确率，仅需100个样本和单次梯度计算即可完成模型适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LASER方法虽然能通过修剪权重矩阵的高阶组件来提升准确率，但其逐层搜索和全数据集前向传播的计算开销使其难以快速部署。本文旨在消除这种开销，实现高效的LLM适应。

Method: 结合四个关键发现：(i) 仅检查少量关键矩阵，消除逐层扫描；(ii) 使用矩阵奇异值的梯度识别需要降维的矩阵；(iii) 扩展分解搜索空间，允许矩阵行围绕多个子空间聚类；(iv) 仅使用100个样本计算梯度和评估准确率。

Result: 该方法进一步减少过拟合，将准确率提升高达24.6个百分点，同时大幅减少搜索时间。仅需单次梯度步骤和快速扫描候选层，即可完成LLM对新数据集的适配。

Conclusion: 提出了一种快速、鲁棒的LLM适应算法，无需微调即可有效适配下游任务，显著降低了计算开销和部署时间。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图重布线技术虽能缓解图神经网络中的过度压缩问题，但会改变图拓扑结构，可能扭曲重要的拓扑依赖信号。目前缺乏对哪些结构属性必须保留以确保性能提升和结构保真度的系统理解。

Method: 研究了七种不同的重布线策略，并将局部和全局图属性的变化与节点分类准确性相关联。

Result: 结果显示成功的重布线方法倾向于保留局部结构，同时允许全局连接性的灵活性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计有效的重布线策略提供了新见解，弥合了图理论与实际GNN优化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

Method: 评估RAMI 4.0和ISA-95标准对MLOps集成的适用性，通过真实用例将MLOps生命周期组件详细映射到RAMI 4.0模型。

Result: 研究发现标准MLOps实践不能直接移植到OT环境，但通过使用现有参考模型进行结构化适配可以提供成功的集成路径。

Abstract: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices are increas- ingly adopted in

systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic

evaluate the suitability of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0

MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-
nents to RAMI 4.0 exemplified by a real-world use case. Our findings
demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

Motivation: 现有端到端推理模型在训练分布外泛化能力有限，需要解决比训练时更复杂问题的挑战

Method: 学习子问题的能量景观，在测试时通过组合多个子问题的能量函数构建全局能量景观，并引入并行能量最小化来提升采样质量

Result: 在多种推理问题上超越现有最优方法，能够泛化到更大更复杂的问题

Conclusion: 通过组合子问题能量景观的方法有效提升了推理任务的泛化能力

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SGD分析依赖于过强（有界方差）或过粗糙（均匀噪声）的假设，而期望光滑性条件提供了更灵活的替代方案，将随机梯度的二阶矩与目标函数值和全梯度联系起来。

Method: 通过细化期望光滑性条件的解释和采样相关常数，推导全梯度范数平方的期望界，并对不同步长策略进行收敛性分析。

Result: 证明了SGD在期望光滑性条件下具有O(1/K)的收敛速率，并给出了显式的残差误差项。

Conclusion: 该分析统一并扩展了近期相关研究，为SGD在更一般条件下的收敛性提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

Motivation: 研究在现实计算预算下代码生成任务的检索设计，为构建高效的代码导向RAG系统提供基于证据的建议。

Method: 使用Long Code Arena中的代码补全和bug定位任务，系统比较检索配置在三个维度：分块策略、相似性评分和分割粒度，评估不同上下文窗口大小下的表现。

Result: PL-PL任务中稀疏BM25+词级分割显著优于密集方法且快10倍；NL-PL任务中专有密集编码器表现更好但延迟高100倍；32-64行块在小预算下最佳，16000词时整文件检索有竞争力；行分割与语法分割效果相当；BM25+词分割提供最佳质量-延迟权衡。

Conclusion: 为基于任务需求、模型约束和计算效率实现有效的代码导向RAG系统提供了基于证据的推荐配置。

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

Motivation: 质谱在分子识别中起关键作用，但由于标注谱图稀缺，从质谱数据解析结构仍具挑战性。现有大规模预训练方法难以直接应用于质谱领域，因为原始谱信号复杂且异质性强。

Method: 提出MS-BART框架：1）将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表；2）通过大规模预训练在指纹-分子数据集上进行跨模态学习；3）多任务预训练目标联合优化去噪和翻译任务；4）使用MIST生成的指纹预测进行微调；5）引入化学反馈机制减少分子幻觉。

Result: 在MassSpecGym和NPLIB1的12个关键指标中，MS-BART在5个指标上达到SOTA性能，比基于扩散的竞争方法快一个数量级。消融研究系统验证了模型的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MS-BART通过统一建模框架和跨模态预训练，有效解决了质谱结构解析中的数据稀缺问题，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

*Aki Rehn,Linzh Zhao,Mikko A. Heikkilä,Antti Honkela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私迁移学习中的两个关键超参数：裁剪边界C和批次大小B。研究发现当前理论（强隐私需要更小的C）与实证结果（强隐私下更大的C表现更好）存在不匹配，并揭示了现有批次大小调优启发式方法无效，而累积DP噪声能更好解释批次大小选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私迁移学习是目前在隐私约束下训练大模型的最先进方法，但其中关键超参数C和B的选择存在理论与实践的不一致，需要深入分析以优化性能。

Method: 通过分析梯度分布变化、将裁剪视为梯度重加权形式、以及检查累积DP噪声的影响，来研究C和B在不同隐私约束和计算预算下的最优选择。

Result: 发现当前理论指导的C选择与实证结果不匹配，现有批次大小调优启发式方法无效，而使用单一(C,B)设置跨任务会导致次优性能，特别是在隐私约束松紧和计算资源多少变化时性能下降明显。

Conclusion: 需要重新审视差分隐私迁移学习中超参数选择的理论基础，考虑梯度分布变化和累积DP噪声的影响，针对不同任务和约束条件进行个性化参数调优。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

TL;DR: H-SPLID是一种通过显式分解显著和非显著特征到不同空间来学习显著特征表示的新算法，能够促进学习低维的任务相关特征，并建立鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的特征学习方法往往无法明确区分显著和非显著特征，导致模型可能过度依赖非任务相关的特征，影响模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: H-SPLID算法显式地将显著和非显著特征分解到不同的表示空间中，通过Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则(HSIC)来约束表示与输入之间的关系，并理论证明了输入扰动下的预期预测偏差受到显著子空间维度和HSIC的上界约束。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实证评估表明，使用H-SPLID训练的模型主要依赖显著的输入组件，对影响非显著特征（如图像背景）的扰动表现出降低的敏感性。

Conclusion: H-SPLID成功建立了鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系，通过显式特征分解促进了任务相关特征的提取，提高了模型对非显著特征扰动的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗保健中的应用可能放大临床数据中的结构性不平等和社会偏见，特别是在生存分析中，删失和时间动态使公平模型开发更加复杂

Method: 提出FASM方法，设计用于减轻算法偏见，关注组内和跨组风险排序的公平性，使用乳腺癌预后作为代表性案例，应用于SEER乳腺癌数据

Result: FASM显著提高了公平性，同时保持了与未考虑公平性的生存模型相当的判别性能，时间分层评估显示FASM在10年期间保持稳定的公平性

Conclusion: 该方法能够开发既注重准确性又注重公平性的生存模型，将公平性作为临床护理的核心原则

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot

experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning
(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,
varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

Motivation: 互信息是表示学习中的重要统计依赖度量，但直接优化往往难以处理。虽然已有方法使用JSD等替代度量，但这些替代目标与互信息的关系仍不清楚。

Method: 推导了KLD作为JSD函数的紧致下界，通过二元分类器的交叉熵损失实现JSD目标，并与最先进的神经估计器进行比较。

Result: 实验表明该下界在互信息估计中紧致，能提供稳定、低方差的互信息下界估计，在信息瓶颈框架中也具有实用价值。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在基于互信息的表示学习中使用判别式学习提供了新的理论依据和强有力的实证证据。

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列中的极端事件（如洪水、热浪、医疗紧急事件）具有重要实际意义，但现有模型在预测极端事件时面临数据不平衡和忽略中间事件信息的挑战。

Method: 提出xTime框架：1）使用知识蒸馏从训练在较低稀有度事件上的模型转移信息；2）引入专家混合机制动态选择和融合不同稀有度级别的专家模型输出。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，xTime在极端事件上的预测准确率从3%提升到78%，实现了显著的性能改进。

Conclusion: xTime通过知识蒸馏和专家混合机制有效解决了极端事件预测中的数据不平衡问题，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

Motivation: GNSS信号在城市环境中易受干扰，现有数据驱动方法定位效果尚可但RSS场重建较差，因为缺乏空间上下文信息。需要结合物理模型来确保一致性并利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应。

Method: 混合贝叶斯专家混合框架：物理路径损耗专家确保物理一致性，CNN专家利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应，通过对数线性池化融合两者。使用拉普拉斯近似进行贝叶斯推断，提供干扰源位置和RSS场的后验不确定性。

Result: 在城市射线追踪数据上的实验表明：随着训练点增加，定位精度提高且不确定性降低；不确定性集中在干扰源附近和城市峡谷区域，这些区域的传播最为敏感。

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架成功融合了物理模型和数据驱动方法，在GNSS干扰源定位和RSS场重建方面优于纯数据驱动方法，并能提供有意义的空间不确定性估计。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and

Conclusion: Spikachu提供了一个基于SNN的可扩展、在线兼容的神经解码框架，其性能与最先进模型相当，同时能耗显著降低。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: 这种基于证据的方法为医疗系统使用数据驱动优化技术系统化改进住院患者跌倒预防协议和患者安全提供了稳健基础，有助于改善风险评估和医疗资源配置。

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

Motivation: Thompson采样在序列决策中应用广泛，但在强化学习等具有复杂时间结构的场景中理论基础有限，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 使用具有高斯边际分布的模型，考虑episodic强化学习中的Thompson采样，采用联合高斯过程先验建模奖励和状态转移。

Result: 证明了在K个episode、每个episode长度为H的情况下，遗憾界为$\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\sqrt{KH\\Gamma(KH)})$，其中$\Gamma(\\cdot)$捕获高斯过程模型的复杂度。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对Thompson采样在强化学习中理解，展示了结构假设和模型不确定性如何影响其在有限时域马尔可夫决策过程中的性能。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的"思维通信"范式，使AI代理能够直接进行思维层面的交流，超越自然语言的限制，从而提高集体智能的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言的模糊性、间接性和有损性限制了集体智能的潜力。虽然机器不受这些限制，但大多数基于LLM的多代理系统仍仅依赖自然语言交流。

Method: 将思维通信形式化为潜变量模型，通过理论证明在非参数设置下可以识别共享和私有的潜在思维，并开发了从所有代理提取潜在思维并在通信前分配相关思维的框架。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试上的实验验证了理论，并展示了思维通信的协作优势。

Conclusion: 思维通信范式超越了语言限制，可以扩展到所有模态，揭示了利用隐藏世界的潜力，因为许多挑战仅通过表面观察无法解决。

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于狄利克雷过程的多模态学习框架，通过DP的富者更富特性自动平衡模态内特征学习和跨模态对齐，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态融合中如何在保持各模态特征表达能力的同时学习跨模态交互的关键挑战。现有方法过度强调模态边缘分布对齐可能导致过度正则化并阻碍有意义的模态内表示。

Method: 假设每个模态遵循多元高斯混合分布，采用狄利克雷过程计算所有分量的混合权重，利用DP的富者更富特性动态分配特征贡献并选择最突出的特征，促进多模态特征融合。

Result: 在多个多模态数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型优于其他竞争方法。消融分析进一步验证了DP在模态分布对齐方面的有效性及其对关键超参数变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的DP驱动多模态学习框架能够自动实现突出的模态内表示学习和跨模态对齐之间的最优平衡，为多模态融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵长类或人类等生物数据稀缺，高吞吐量记录技术难以应用，这对深度学习解码技术构成挑战。

Method: 结合神经元特异性MEIs、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练的生物信息解码方法。

Result: 在V1区单细胞活动重建视觉刺激方面达到最先进性能，特别擅长处理少量神经元和小数据集，仅需1,000-2,500个神经元和不到1,000个训练数据点即可重建高保真自然图像。

Conclusion: 证明了早期视觉系统中可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了Transformer模型在象棋任务中的系统泛化能力，发现模型能够进行组合泛化，在分布外场景中仍能遵循游戏规则并生成高质量走法，但在更复杂的变体如Chess960中表现不如符号AI算法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代决策Transformer是否真正理解象棋规则，而不仅仅是学习训练数据中的模式，通过测试其在分布外场景中的表现来评估其系统泛化能力。

Method: 训练了一个2.7亿参数的象棋Transformer模型，并在设计好的分布外场景中进行测试，包括规则外推和Chess960变体，分析模型的泛化能力和训练动态。

Result: Transformer展现出组合泛化能力，在分布外情况下仍能选择有效走法；在Chess960中表现不如符号AI，但与人类玩家对弈时差距较小；训练动态显示模型先学会移动己方棋子。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习象棋的基本组合结构，在规则遵循方面表现良好，但在需要深度战略规划的复杂变体中仍不如基于搜索的符号AI方法。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

### [262] [KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning is Designed to Mode Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20817)
*Anthony GX-Chen,Jatin Prakash,Jeff Guo,Rob Fergus,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了传统观点，证明在强化学习中，反向/正向KL散度的选择并不决定模式覆盖，而是定义了最优目标分布族。模式覆盖主要取决于正则化强度、奖励与参考概率的相对尺度等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为反向KL导致"模式寻找"，正向KL导致"质量覆盖"，但作者发现这种直觉在强化学习中不成立，需要重新理解KL正则化在语言模型强化学习中的作用。

Method: 通过数学分析和实证研究，构建了一个简单、可扩展的理论驱动算法，仅对奖励幅度进行最小修改，就能优化目标分布以覆盖所有高质量采样模式。

Result: 该方法在大型语言模型和化学语言模型的后训练中都提高了解决方案的质量和多样性，无需外部多样性信号，且适用于正向和反向KL。

Conclusion: 模式覆盖主要受正则化强度等因素影响，而非KL散度类型的选择。提出的算法能有效提升生成多样性和质量。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.
