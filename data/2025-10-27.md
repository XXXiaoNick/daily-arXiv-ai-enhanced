### [1] [Shoot First, Ask Questions Later? Building Rational Agents that Explore and Act Like People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20886)
*Gabriel Grand,Valerio Pepe,Jacob Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文开发了基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理策略，用于提升语言模型在战略决策对话任务中的理性信息寻求能力，显著提高了信息获取效率和决策准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学和诊断等高风险AI应用中，需要形成数据驱动的假设并进行有针对性的猜测。现有语言模型代理在理性信息寻求方面存在不足，特别是在平衡探索（提问）和行动（决策）方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出了协作战舰战略决策对话任务，开发了基于贝叶斯实验设计原理的蒙特卡洛推理策略，用于提升语言模型代理的信息寻求能力。

Result: 该方法使观察者代理准确率提升14.7%，指挥官代理预期信息增益提升0.227比特（达到噪声上限的94.2%）。较弱模型Llama-4-Scout的胜率从8%提升至82%，并能以约1%的成本击败GPT-5。

Conclusion: 基于贝叶斯实验设计的推理策略能显著提升语言模型代理的理性信息寻求能力，该方法在多个任务中具有通用性，为构建理性AI代理提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

### [2] [Code-enabled language models can outperform reasoning models on diverse tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20909)
*Cedegao E. Zhang,Cédric Colas,Gabriel Poesia,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeAdapt方法通过结合CodeAct框架和少样本引导上下文学习，使标准指令语言模型无需微调即可达到或超越对应推理模型的性能，在多个任务上表现更优且token效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理模型需要大量计算资源和数据训练，运行成本高且效率低。研究发现标准指令语言模型本身已具备强大的推理能力，但需要合适的激发方法。

Method: 提出CodeAdapt方法：结合CodeAct框架（语言模型在自然语言推理中穿插代码执行）和少样本引导上下文学习，仅需5个训练问题即可激发模型的推理能力。

Result: 在4对匹配的语言模型和推理模型对比中，CodeAdapt使3个语言模型在8个任务上平均表现优于对应推理模型（最高提升22.9%），token效率提高10-81%，在6个任务上平均表现提升最高达35.7%。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt式学习具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，代码增强的语言模型是认知基础扎实且强大的系统，为权重内强化学习提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

### [3] [FicSim: A Dataset for Multi-Faceted Semantic Similarity in Long-Form Fiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20926)
*Natasha Johnson,Amanda Bertsch,Maria-Emil Deal,Emma Strubell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FICSIM是一个用于评估语言模型在计算文学研究中应用的长篇小说相似性数据集，包含12个相似性维度的评分，由作者提供的元数据和数字人文学者验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型处理长文本能力的增强，其在计算文学研究中的应用日益重要，但评估这些模型的有效性面临挑战，包括长文本细粒度标注成本高、公共领域文学数据污染问题，以及现有嵌入相似性数据集不适用于文学领域任务。

Method: 构建FICSIM数据集，包含长篇现代小说，基于作者提供的元数据和数字人文学者验证，定义了12个相似性维度进行评分。评估了一系列嵌入模型在该任务上的表现。

Result: 评估显示，各模型普遍倾向于关注表层特征，而非对计算文学研究任务有用的语义类别。

Conclusion: FICSIM数据集为评估语言模型在文学领域的应用提供了有效工具，揭示了当前模型在理解文学语义方面的局限性。在数据收集过程中，作者自主权和持续知情同意得到优先保障。

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

### [4] [Do LLMs Truly Understand When a Precedent Is Overruled?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20941)
*Li Zhang,Jaromir Savelka,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型在识别美国最高法院案例推翻关系方面的能力，发现存在时代敏感性、浅层推理和上下文相关推理失败等关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文评估大多依赖简化的合成任务，无法代表真实世界文档理解的复杂性。推翻关系是普通法体系的基础，为长文档法律理解提供了重要测试平台。

Method: 使用236对案例数据集，评估最先进的大语言模型识别美国最高法院案例中的推翻关系的能力。

Result: 模型在历史案例上表现较差，存在时代敏感性；依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解；在复杂开放任务中产生时间上不可能的关系。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了现实长上下文评估的关键空白，提供了一个反映实际法律推理任务复杂性和重要性的基准环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

### [5] [Irish-BLiMP: A Linguistic Benchmark for Evaluating Human and Language Model Performance in a Low-Resource Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20957)
*Josh McGiff,Khanh-Tung Tran,William Mulcahy,Dáibhidh Ó Luinín,Jake Dalzell,Róisín Ní Bhroin,Adam Burke,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 爱尔兰-BLiMP是首个为爱尔兰语设计的细粒度语言能力评估数据集和框架，包含1020个最小对，评估显示人类在所有语言特征上都优于所有LLM模型，准确率平均高出16.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为濒危语言爱尔兰语创建首个系统性的语言能力评估框架，填补低资源语言在LLM评估方面的空白。

Method: 基于语言学文献和语法参考书，由流利的爱尔兰语使用者团队手动构建和审查1020个最小对，涵盖11个语言特征分类，评估现有LLM和人类参与者的句法知识。

Result: 人类在所有语言特征上都优于所有模型，平均准确率高16.6%；开源和闭源LLM之间存在18.1%的性能差距；最强的GPT-5模型仅达到73.5%准确率，而人类达到90.1%。

Conclusion: 爱尔兰-BLiMP为评估LLM在爱尔兰语中的语法能力提供了首个系统性框架，并为推进低资源语言理解研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

### [6] [Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-thought is Necessary for Llms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007)
*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出置信度门控的思维链方法，让模型仅在直接回答置信度低时才进行推理，以减少不必要的token使用并提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链提示能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但过长的推理会增加token使用量，且在某些任务中反而会降低性能。需要一种自适应机制来决定何时使用思维链。

Method: 研究了四种无需训练的置信度估计方法，用于判断何时需要思维链推理，并与随机基准和完美预知进行对比。

Result: 现有无需训练的置信度测量方法能减少冗余思维链，优于随机调用思维链，但不同方法的效果因数据集和模型而异，存在不一致性。

Conclusion: 置信度门控思维链有潜力，但当前方法在实际部署中仍面临挑战，需要更可靠的自适应门控机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

### [7] [Input Matters: Evaluating Input Structure's Impact on LLM Summaries of Sports Play-by-Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21034)
*Barkavi Sundararajan,Somayajulu Sripada,Ehud Reiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究量化了输入数据结构对LLM生成NBA比赛摘要中幻觉和事实错误的影响，发现JSON格式输入相比非结构化输入能减少约65-69%的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在体育报道等准确性要求高的领域部署LLM时，生成文本可能无法忠实反映输入数据，需要量化输入结构对事实错误的影响。

Method: 使用三种输入格式（行结构、JSON、非结构化）测试两个LLM模型（Llama-3.1-70B和Qwen2.5-72B）生成NBA比赛摘要，人工标注了3,312个事实错误。

Result: 输入结构对错误率有显著影响：JSON输入相比非结构化输入减少错误率69%（Llama）和65%（Qwen），行结构输入减少54%（Llama）和51%（Qwen）。ANOVA分析显示输入结构解释了80%以上的错误率方差。

Conclusion: 输入数据结构是影响LLM生成文本准确性的关键因素，结构化输入（特别是JSON格式）能显著减少事实错误。

Abstract: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as
sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the
input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other
factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across
three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated
3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models,
Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input
reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured
input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for
Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for
over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests
confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

### [8] [Reasoning's Razor: Reasoning Improves Accuracy but Can Hurt Recall at Critical Operating Points in Safety and Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21049)
*Atoosa Chegini,Hamid Kazemi,Garrett Souza,Maria Safi,Yang Song,Samy Bengio,Sinead Williamson,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究在严格低误报率(FPR)机制下推理对分类任务的影响，发现在精度敏感场景中，推理增强的Think On模式虽然提升整体准确率，但在低FPR阈值下表现不佳，而Think Off模式在精度敏感场景中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理已成为大语言模型(LLMs)的核心范式，能持续提升各种基准测试的准确率，但其在精度敏感任务中的适用性仍不明确。

Method: 研究涵盖安全检测和幻觉检测两个任务，在微调和零样本设置下评估标准LLMs和大推理模型(LRMs)，比较Think On(推理增强)和Think Off(无推理)两种模式，并分析基于token的评分与自我表达置信度的表现。

Result: 发现明显的权衡：Think On提高整体准确率，但在实际应用必需的低FPR阈值下表现不佳；Think Off在精度敏感机制中占主导地位；基于token的评分显著优于自我表达置信度；两种模式的简单集成能恢复各自优势。

Conclusion: 推理是一把双刃剑：对平均准确率有益，但通常不适合需要严格精度的应用场景。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

### [9] [Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing via Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21059)
*Mahmud Wasif Nafee,Maiqi Jiang,Haipeng Chen,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DR-IKE是一个轻量级框架，通过动态检索和剪枝演示示例来实现上下文知识编辑，无需修改模型权重，兼容黑盒LLM，在COUNTERFACT基准上显著提升了编辑成功率并降低了延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前上下文知识编辑方法存在的两个问题：(1)数量-质量权衡问题，(2)缺乏对任务难度的适应性。这些方法依赖基于表面相似性的静态演示集选择。

Method: 提出DR-IKE框架：(1)使用REINFORCE训练BERT检索器，根据编辑奖励对演示进行排序；(2)采用可学习阈值剪枝低价值示例，在编辑简单时缩短提示，任务困难时扩展提示。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准上，编辑成功率提升高达17.1%，延迟降低41.6%，同时保持对无关查询的准确性，展示了可扩展和自适应的知识编辑能力。

Conclusion: DR-IKE提供了一种无需修改模型权重的梯度自由解决方案，通过动态演示选择有效解决了上下文知识编辑中的关键挑战，为黑盒LLM的知识更新提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at
https://github.com/mwnafee/DR-IKE .

*William Christian,Daniel Adamlu,Adrian Yu,Derwin Suhartono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究将自适应RAG系统应用于印尼语问答，通过问题复杂度分类器选择回答策略，使用机器翻译进行数据增强，发现分类器可靠但多检索策略存在不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前最先进的问答系统主要针对英语，而印尼语等低资源语言缺乏相应研究的问题。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，集成问题复杂度分类器，根据问题复杂度选择回答策略，并使用机器翻译进行数据增强以克服印尼语数据集有限的挑战。

Result: 问题复杂度分类器表现可靠，但多检索回答策略存在显著不一致性，对整体评估产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究显示了低资源语言问答的潜力与挑战，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能药物推荐系统对提高临床决策质量至关重要，但缺乏公开可用的真实世界电子健康记录数据集，特别是非英语数据集，阻碍了相关研究的发展。

Method: 构建了包含5,894条脱敏记录的中文药物推荐数据集CDrugRed，涵盖患者人口统计、病史、临床过程和出院诊断等信息，并基于该数据集对多种最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 监督微调能提升模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1分数为0.5648，Jaccard分数为0.4477，表明临床药物推荐任务的复杂性。

Conclusion: CDrugRed是一个具有挑战性且有价值的资源，可用于开发更稳健和准确的药物推荐系统，该数据集已公开供研究社区使用。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.
The dataset is publicly available to the research community under the data

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型对数策略比率的自奖励机制，实现无需人工偏好标注的在线策略微调，提高泛化性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督微调(SFT)在有限数据场景下容易过拟合和泛化能力差的问题，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的情况下。

Method: 结合SFT和近端策略优化(PPO)，设计以预训练策略为基线、SFT策略为目标的奖励函数，实现自奖励机制，无需人工偏好标注即可进行在线策略微调。

Result: 在多个自然语言处理任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，在泛化能力、数据效率和鲁棒性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效利用演示数据对齐大语言模型，特别适用于高质量标注数据稀缺的场景，为LLM对齐提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

Motivation: 现有LLM忠实度基准存在标注模糊问题，主要由于生成输出中允许使用外部知识的边界定义不清，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出新的忠实度标注框架，引入Out-Dependent中间类别来分类需要外部知识验证的情况，并构建VeriGray基准数据集。

Result: 统计显示即使最先进的LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉，平均约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别。基准对多种基线方法构成显著挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊对于不忠实检测基准至关重要，当前方法仍有很大改进空间，VeriGray基准为未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统综述了大型语言模型与文本属性图的集成，提出了从编排视角的分类法，涵盖LLM增强图任务和图结构增强LLM推理两个方向，并讨论了序列、并行和多模块框架等编排策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语义理解方面表现出色但缺乏结构化推理能力，而文本属性图提供显式关系结构但语义深度不足。两者的结合可以产生互补优势，增强图表示学习并提升LLM的推理能力和可解释性。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的分类法，包括两个基本方向：LLM用于TAG（LLM丰富基于图的任务）和TAG用于LLM（结构化图改进LLM推理）。将编排策略分为序列、并行和多模块框架，并讨论了TAG特定的预训练、提示和参数高效微调方法。

Result: 总结了实证见解，整理了可用数据集，并突出了在推荐系统、生物医学分析和知识密集型问答等领域的多样化应用。

Conclusion: 论文为语言和图学习交叉领域的未来研究提供了指导，并概述了开放挑战和有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

TL;DR: LLMs在模拟人类行为时存在理想化偏差，无法真实再现人类社会的复杂性，而是呈现出缺乏多样性的"乌托邦"社会特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要评估LLMs在模拟人类行为时的可靠性，因为它们在社会科学研究和实际应用中可能产生误解和意外后果。

Method: 通过聊天室式对话模拟多智能体互动，从五个语言维度分析LLMs的行为，检测其社会认知偏差。

Result: 实验发现LLMs不能忠实再现真实人类行为，而是表现出社会角色偏差、首因效应和积极偏见，形成过度理想化的"乌托邦"社会。

Conclusion: 需要开发更具社会基础性的LLMs，以捕捉人类社交行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Motivation: 爱沙尼亚语的LLM基准测试有限，缺乏对不同LLM在爱沙尼亚语任务上性能的全面比较评估。

Method: 基于7个多样化数据集构建新基准，数据集来自原生爱沙尼亚语源而非机器翻译，评估了6个基础模型和26个指令调优模型，采用人工评估和LLM作为评判者两种方法。

Result: 人工评估分数与基准评估呈现中等到高度相关性，Claude 3.7 Sonnet作为LLM评判者与人类评分高度一致。

Conclusion: 表现最佳的LLM可以有效支持爱沙尼亚语模型的评估，LLM作为评判者与人类评估具有良好的一致性。

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

Abstract: The rise of right-wing populism in Europe has brought to the forefront the
significance of analysing social media discourse to understand the
dissemination of extremist ideologies and their impact on political outcomes.
Twitter, as a platform for interaction and mobilisation, provides a unique
window into the everyday communication of far-right supporters. In this paper,
we propose a methodology that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques with sociological insights to analyse the MIGR-TWIT corpus of
far-right tweets in English and French. We aim to uncover patterns of discourse
surrounding migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques employed by right

computational approaches, we seek to offer cross-disciplinary insights into
societal dynamics and contribute to a better understanding of contemporary
challenges posed by right-wing extremism on social media platforms.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于临床分类学和大型语言模型的多智能体系统，用于模拟紧急医疗调度场景，通过人类评估和自动化分析验证了系统的高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧急医疗调度面临呼叫者紧张、信息模糊和认知负荷等挑战，大型语言模型和多智能体系统为增强调度员能力提供了机会。

Method: 构建了包含32种主诉和6种呼叫者身份的临床分类学，开发了基于AutoGen的多智能体系统，包含呼叫者和调度员智能体，使用混合评估框架（4名医生评估100个模拟案例，辅以自动语言分析）。

Result: 人类评估显示系统表现优异：调度有效性94%，指导效能91%，自动指标显示中性情感特征（73.7%中性情感），高可读性（Flesch 80.9）和礼貌风格（60%礼貌，0%不礼貌）。

Conclusion: 该系统能高保真地模拟多样化的临床合理调度场景，可用于调度员培训、协议评估和实时决策支持，为安全整合AI到应急响应工作流程提供了路径。

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标强调局部预测准确性但忽略长程结构复杂性，无法解释LLM即使困惑度低时仍出现重复和不连贯等令人困惑的行为。

Method: 使用相关性维度（一种分形几何的自相似性度量）来量化语言模型感知的文本认识论复杂性，该方法能捕捉语言的分层递归结构。

Result: 相关性维度揭示了预训练中的三个不同阶段，反映了上下文依赖的复杂性，指示了模型的幻觉倾向，并能可靠检测生成文本中的多种退化形式。

Conclusion: 相关性维度是一种计算高效、对模型量化鲁棒、适用于多种自回归架构的方法，为LLM的生成动态提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn)方法，通过利用注意力的置换特性来提高块级稀疏度，在大语言模型的长上下文预填充中实现高达2.75倍的端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的上下文长度扩展具有显著优势但计算成本高昂，主要源于自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度。虽然注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，但现有的块稀疏注意力方法在块级稀疏度方面存在次优问题。

Method: 提出PBS-Attn方法，将序列划分为块并利用注意力的置换特性来增加块级稀疏度，减少计算冗余。该方法采用自定义的permuted-FlashAttention内核实现。

Result: 在具有挑战性的真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型准确性上持续优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，且与完整注意力基线接近。在长上下文预填充中实现高达2.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种即插即用的高效方法，通过提高块级稀疏度显著提升大语言模型长上下文处理的计算效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

TL;DR: PARL是一种使用大型语言模型作为强化学习代理的方法，通过提示工程实现，无需微调。该方法在非语言依赖的强化学习任务中表现良好，但在需要复杂数学运算的任务中存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注语言表示的任务，而本研究探索LLMs在结构化、非语言推理任务（如网格世界位置解释）中作为强化学习代理的能力。

Method: PARL通过提示工程将动作、状态和奖励编码到提示中，使LLM能够通过试错交互进行学习，无需对模型进行微调。

Result: 在三个标准强化学习任务中，PARL能够匹配或超越传统强化学习代理在简单环境中的表现，但需要复杂数学运算或状态动作解码的任务中表现受限。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为有效的强化学习代理，特别是在简单环境中能够利用预训练知识，但在处理复杂数学运算时存在性能限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中，准确估计LLM的语义偶然性和认知不确定性具有挑战性，通常需要大量昂贵的生成过程。

Method: 使用自然语言推理模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，覆盖自回归和掩码扩散范式，并通过重要性重加权和方差缩减技术优化不确定性估计。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法在相同样本数量下匹配或超越基线方法，覆盖更多语义簇。

Conclusion: 该框架作为模块化增强方案，无需访问基础LLM的梯度，有望在风险敏感模型部署中提升不确定性估计效果。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了英语中typoglycemia现象（字母乱序但可读）对NLP模型的影响，发现模型对此具有较强鲁棒性，主要原因是英语中因字母乱序而混淆的单词数量较少，且这些混淆词通常出现在不同上下文中易于区分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么NLP模型在单词内部字母顺序被打乱时仍能保持良好性能，特别是当不同单词（如form和from）在typoglycemia下会变成相同表示时，模型如何有效区分它们。

Method: 分析英国国家语料库量化单词混淆情况；评估BERT区分混淆形式的能力；通过对比在干净文本和typoglycemic文本上训练的BERT变体进行探测实验。

Result: 研究发现因字母乱序而混淆的英语单词数量相对较少，混淆词通常出现在不同上下文中易于区分，BERT能够有效处理这种混淆，字母乱序导致的性能下降比预期要小。

Conclusion: NLP模型对typoglycemia的鲁棒性主要源于英语语言本身的特性——混淆词数量有限且上下文差异明显，使得消歧变得相对简单。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

TL;DR: TripTide是首个评估LLM在现实旅行中断情况下修订行程能力的基准，通过建模中断严重性和旅行者容忍度等维度，评估LLM对航班取消、天气关闭等事件的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能生成个性化行程，但无法有效处理现实旅行中常见的中断情况，需要评估LLM在动态变化环境中的适应能力。

Method: 采用三重评估方法：1）自动指标评估（意图保持、响应性、适应性）；2）LLM作为评判者自动评估修订质量；3）人工专家评估语义、空间、顺序和响应方面的保持情况。

Result: LLM在顺序一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，空间偏差在短途旅行中较大但随行程延长而减小。然而，随着计划长度增加，中断处理能力下降，显示LLM鲁棒性存在局限。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在现实不确定性下的旅行规划适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了当前模型在长行程中断处理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

TL;DR: 研究发现单轮训练比多轮训练在推理任务上更有效，单轮训练的模型能很好泛化到单轮和多轮评估，而多轮训练会显著降低单轮推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多轮人机交互训练是否对推理任务必要，因为大语言模型的推理能力通常通过单轮强化学习开发，而实际应用涉及多轮交互，存在训练与部署条件不匹配的问题。

Method: 比较传统单轮训练与三种多轮训练策略，评估模型在单轮和多轮推理任务上的表现。

Result: 单轮训练的模型能有效泛化到单轮和多轮评估，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练比多轮训练更有效可靠，多轮训练仅提供有限益处甚至可能降低推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 现有的瑞典基准大多是翻译自美国中心的基准，不适合测试瑞典特定知识。

Method: 手动编写问答数据集，灵感来自瑞典文化媒体名人广播节目和主要体育赛事，包含英语翻译。

Result: 发现具有更强瑞典覆盖度的小模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面表现与三倍大的多语言模型相当；继续在瑞典语上预训练通常能提高事实知识，但也会导致部分先前知识的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集可作为研究多语言模型中语言适应和知识保留的诊断工具。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

TL;DR: SindBERT是首个基于RoBERTa的大规模土耳其语编码器模型，在多项NLP任务中表现优异，但研究表明当前土耳其语基准可能已饱和，语料质量比数据量更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形态丰富语言在大型预训练模型中的代表性不足问题，为土耳其语NLP提供首个大规模编码器模型。

Method: 使用312GB土耳其语文本（mC4、OSCAR23、Wikipedia）从头训练RoBERTa基础的编码器模型，提供基础和大型两种配置。

Result: SindBERT在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准测试中表现优异，大型变体在四项任务中的两项获得最佳分数，但整体没有持续的规模优势。

Conclusion: SindBERT作为土耳其语NLP的开放资源，同时揭示了在形态丰富语言中语料组成比单纯数据规模更重要的经验教训。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

TL;DR: HalleluBERT是一个基于RoBERTa的希伯来语编码器家族，在49.1GB去重希伯来语文本上从头训练，在NER和情感分类任务上超越现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的希伯来语模型如HeBERT、AlephBERT和HeRo在语料库规模、词汇表或训练深度方面存在限制，希伯来语缺乏大规模RoBERTa编码器。

Method: 使用希伯来语特定的字节级BPE词汇表，在49.1GB去重的希伯来语网页文本和维基百科上从头训练RoBERTa基础的编码器家族（基础和大型）。

Result: 在NER和情感分类基准测试中，HalleluBERT超越了单语和多语言基线模型，为希伯来语设定了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: HalleluBERT展示了完全收敛的单语预训练的优势，为希伯来语NLP提供了更好的编码器模型。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced NLP, yet Hebrew still lacks a
large-scale RoBERTa encoder which is extensively trained. Existing models such
as HeBERT, AlephBERT, and HeRo are limited by corpus size, vocabulary, or
training depth. We present HalleluBERT, a RoBERTa-based encoder family (base
and large) trained from scratch on 49.1~GB of deduplicated Hebrew web text and
Wikipedia with a Hebrew-specific byte-level BPE vocabulary. Evaluated on NER
and sentiment classification benchmarks, HalleluBERT outperforms both
monolingual and multilingual baselines. HalleluBERT sets a new state of the art
for Hebrew and highlights the benefits of fully converged monolingual
pretraining.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型在人类活动识别中的应用，提出了新的评估方法和数据集，发现VLMs在性能上与传统深度学习方法相当甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，视觉语言模型在医疗健康应用中显示出潜力，但在远程健康监测的人类活动识别领域仍相对未被充分探索。VLMs具有更好的灵活性和克服传统深度学习模型限制的能力，但其动态和非确定性输出的评估是一个关键挑战。

Method: 引入了描述性字幕数据集，并提出了全面的评估方法来评估VLMs在人类活动识别中的表现。通过与传统深度学习模型进行对比实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，视觉语言模型在人类活动识别中实现了与传统方法相当的性能，在某些情况下甚至超过了传统方法的准确性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为视觉语言模型在智能医疗系统中的集成提供了强有力的基准，并开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了UDCG指标来解决传统IR指标在RAG系统中的不适用问题，通过考虑LLM对检索结果的整体处理和干扰文档的负面影响，显著提高了与最终答案准确性的相关性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标假设用户按顺序浏览文档且注意力随排名下降，但在RAG系统中LLM会整体处理所有检索文档，且干扰文档会主动降低生成质量，导致传统指标无法准确预测RAG性能

Method: 引入基于效用的标注方案，量化相关段落的正面贡献和干扰段落的负面影响，提出UDCG指标，使用面向LLM的位置折扣来直接优化与端到端答案准确性的相关性

Result: 在五个数据集和六个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标将相关性提高了高达36%

Conclusion: 这项工作为将IR评估与LLM消费者对齐提供了关键步骤，实现了对RAG组件更可靠的评估

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了多奖励优化(MRO)方法，通过增强扩散语言模型中的token相关性来提升推理性能，同时实现采样加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在推理性能上落后于自回归大语言模型，主要原因是去噪过程中掩码token的独立生成未能捕捉token相关性。

Method: 使用多奖励优化方法，结合测试时缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习来直接优化token相关性，并引入组步和重要性采样策略来降低奖励方差和提高采样效率。

Result: MRO不仅提高了推理性能，还在保持推理基准测试高表现的同时实现了显著的采样加速。

Conclusion: 增强token相关性是提升扩散语言模型推理性能的关键，MRO方法有效解决了这一问题并实现了性能与效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法在估计和改进语言模型与大脑对齐时存在参与者依赖性强、受个体数据量影响大的问题，限制了向新参与者的泛化和群体层面分析。

Method: 采用多参与者脑调优方法，微调预训练语音语言模型来联合预测多个参与者的fMRI响应。

Conclusion: 多参与者脑调优在神经科学和AI之间创造了双向效益，有助于弥合两个领域之间的差距。

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机制检测的方法来识别RAG系统中的幻觉，通过分离外部上下文和参数知识的贡献，在Qwen3-0.6b上训练回归分类器，并在GPT-4.1-mini上验证了方法的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统虽然整合外部知识来减少幻觉，但模型输出仍常与检索内容不一致。现有方法通常混淆了外部上下文和参数知识的贡献，需要准确分离这两者来进行有效的幻觉检测。

Method: 研究RAG幻觉机制，发现当后期层FFN模块不成比例地注入参数知识时会产生幻觉。基于外部上下文分数和参数知识分数，在Qwen3-0.6b上计算各层和注意力头的分数，训练回归分类器预测幻觉。

Result: 方法在先进LLM（GPT-5、GPT-4.1）和检测基线（RAGAS、TruLens、RefChecker）上进行了评估。在Qwen3-0.6b上训练的模型能够泛化到GPT-4.1-mini的响应，证明了代理模型评估的潜力。

Conclusion: 机制信号是RAG系统中幻觉检测的高效且可泛化的预测指标，为幻觉检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

Conclusion: 范畴论为文档结构分析提供了强大的数学基础，所提出的方法在信息提取、摘要生成和模型改进方面具有显著优势，为多模态文档处理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在多语言行为中的变化是否受到语言谱系结构的影响，特别是模型是否对语言属（linguistic genera）表现出敏感性。

Method: 通过扩展MultiQ数据集的分析，检查模型在提示语言保真度未保持时是否倾向于切换到谱系相关语言，并研究同一语系内与跨语系的知识一致性差异。

Result: 发现属级效应确实存在，但受训练资源可用性的强烈影响；不同LLM家族表现出不同的多语言策略；模型编码了属级结构的某些方面。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型确实编码了属级语言结构的某些方面，但训练数据不平衡仍然是塑造其多语言性能的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

Motivation: 随着语言模型能力的提升，需要超越表面语言能力的更具挑战性评估，特别是语用学层面——理解由上下文、语言和文化规范塑造的情境意义。

Method: 构建了包含405个多项选择题的语用理解基准，通过翻译难度分析、建立人类基线以及LLMs试点评估来验证基准的有效性。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有显著改进，但在推断非字面表达（特别是文化特定表达）的隐含意义时仍会失败，且专有模型与开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准必须精心设计，最好基于本地数据构建，并通过人类响应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Motivation: 语言文档中的词汇数据收集常包含转录错误和未记录的借用词，这会误导语言分析，需要自动检测方法来提高数据质量。

Method: 使用字符级和音节级音位配列特征的无监督异常检测算法，识别潜在的转录错误和借用词。

Result: 音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线方法，虽然精度和召回率因异常细微性而保持中等水平，但高召回方法能为田野工作者提供系统化的条目验证标记。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言文档提供了支持数据质量改进的系统化工具，能够有效识别需要验证的词汇条目。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和编程任务上表现出色，但在金融任务特别是股票预测方面应用不足。研究发现现有LLMs在股票预测中过度依赖分析师观点，缺乏系统性的独立分析逻辑，且未能有效利用推理能力。

Method: 提出RETuning方法，在强化学习前作为冷启动方法。该方法在生成思维链时动态构建分析框架，从多样化信息源组织证据并评分，基于框架而非上下文观点进行反思推理，确保独立逻辑推理。

Conclusion: RETuning方法通过构建分析框架和证据组织，有效增强了LLMs在股票预测中的独立推理能力，减少了上下文的不当影响，使模型获得了有价值的股票预测洞察。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus

### [41] [Safety Monitor for Off-Road Planning with Uncertainty Bounded Bekker Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21006)
*Akshay Naik,Ramavarapu S. Sreenivas,William R. Norris,Albert E. Patterson,Ahmet Soylemezoglu,Dustin Nottage*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种运行时安全保障监控器，用于在土壤强度不确定的情况下确保越野自动驾驶的安全性。该监控器与任何规划器协作，使用基于Bekker的成本模型和边界不确定性，通过检查最大沉降和侧翻余量来保证车辆安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野自动驾驶需要操作约束来确保在土壤强度不确定的情况下行为保持可预测和安全。现有的规划器通常专注于效率，而缺乏对土壤条件不确定性的安全保障机制。

Method: 使用基于Bekker的成本模型构建上置信度穿越成本，通过轻量级压力沉降模型识别现场测试数据。监控器检查每个规划动作是否超过最大沉降和侧翻余量两个限制，如果风险过高则切换到认证的备用方案。

Result: 在从壤土到沙土的模拟环境中测试，结果显示干预率、违规概率和路径效率相对于标称计划的性能。静态加载测试提供了初步实证验证。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将不确定性分析纳入上置信度成本并应用简单干预规则，实现了规划器专注于效率而监控器确保安全的分工，同时保持足够轻量以便在嵌入式处理器上运行。

Abstract: Reliable off-road autonomy requires operational constraints so that behavior
stays predictable and safe when soil strength is uncertain. This paper presents
a runtime assurance safety monitor that collaborates with any planner and uses
a Bekker-based cost model with bounded uncertainty. The monitor builds an upper
confidence traversal cost from a lightweight pressure sinkage model identified
in field tests and checks each planned motion against two limits: maximum
sinkage and rollover margin. If the risk of crossing either limit is too high,
the monitor switches to a certified fallback that reduces vehicle speed,
increases standoff from soft ground, or stops on firmer soil. This separation
lets the planner focus on efficiency while the monitor keeps the vehicle within
clear safety limits on board. Wheel geometry, wheel load estimate, and a soil
raster serve as inputs, which tie safety directly to vehicle design and let the
monitor set clear limits on speed, curvature, and stopping at run time. The
method carries uncertainty analytically into the upper confidence cost and
applies simple intervention rules. Tuning of the sinkage limit, rollover
margin, and risk window trades efficiency for caution while keeping the monitor
light enough for embedded processors. Results from a simulation environment
spanning loam to sand include intervention rates, violation probability, and
path efficiency relative to the nominal plan, and a benchtop static loading
check provides initial empirical validation.

Conclusion: 所提出的鲁棒DAPI控制方案能够有效解决微电网和微电网网络中的频率和电压调节问题，具有抗干扰能力。

Abstract: The transition towards clean energy and the introduction of Distributed
Energy Resources (DERs) are giving rise to the emergence of Microgrids (MGs)
and Networks of MGs (NMGs). MGs and NMGs can operate autonomously in islanded
mode. However, they face challenges in terms of secondary level frequency and
voltage regulation, due to the variable nature of Renewable Energy Sources
(RES) and loads. Distributed-Averaging Proportional-Integral (DAPI) control has
been proposed in the literature for distributed frequency and voltage control
of droop-controlled DERs, but it is not robust to operational or structural
perturbations. To address this, we propose a robust DAPI frequency and voltage
control scheme that ensures robustness using the concept of connective
stability, along with the invariant ellipsoid technique for disturbance
rejection. Simulation of an NMG model in
MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered}/Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
consisting of 3 MGs and 5 DERs validates the effectiveness of the proposed
method, and demonstrates that it can successfully mitigate the effects of major
disturbances such as cyberattacks.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了如何根据季节和设定点变化对训练-测试数据集鲁棒性的要求，系统性地选择降阶模型和参数估计方法。

Abstract: Achieving the flexibility from house heating, cooling, and ventilation
systems (HVAC) has the potential to enable large-scale demand response by
aggregating HVAC load adjustments across many homes. This demand response
strategy helps distribution grid to flexibly ramp-up or ramp-down local load
demand so that it can optimally match the bulk power system generation profile.
However, achieving this capability requires house thermal models that are both
computationally efficient and robust to operating conditions. In this work,
parameters of the Resistance-Capacitance (RC) network thermal model for houses
are estimated using three optimization algorithms: Nonlinear Least Squares
(NLS), Batch Estimation (BE), and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The
resulting models are evaluated through a Forward-Simulation across four
different seasons and three setpoints. The results illustrate a principled way
of selecting reduced order models and estimation methods with respect to the
robustness offered to seasonal and setpoint variations in training-testing
datasets

Method: 基于李雅普诺夫稳定性分析设计自适应律，特别考虑了惯性矩阵和离心-科里奥利矩阵的斜对称特性，开发了物理信息DNN控制器。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与不考虑系统对称性的物理信息自适应律相比，所提出的更新律在个体和整体函数逼近能力方面都有改进。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够保证跟踪误差和斜对称预测误差的渐近收敛，为欧拉-拉格朗日系统提供了具有理论保证的物理信息控制器设计框架。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful black-box function approximators
which have been shown to yield improved performance compared to traditional
neural network (NN) architectures. However, black-box algorithms do not
incorporate known physics of the system and can yield results which are
physically implausible. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have grown in
popularity due to their ability to leverage known physical principles in the
learning process which has been empirically shown to improve performance
compared to traditional black-box methods. This paper introduces the first
physics-informed DNN controller for an Euler-Lagrange dynamic system where the
adaptation laws are designed using a Lyapunov-based stability analysis to
account for the skew-symmetry property of the inertia matrix and
centripetal-Coriolis matrix. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to
guarantee asymptotic convergence of the tracking error and the skew-symmetric
prediction error. Simulations indicate that the developed update law
demonstrates improvement in individual and overall function approximation
capabilities when compared to a physics-informed adaptation law which does not
incorporate knowledge of system symmetries.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合物理启发和数据驱动的框架，用于基于总负荷和环境因素的外部测量来分解BTM组件，包括储能类组件、光伏发电组件、温控负荷组件和周期性组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着BTM资源的渗透率增加，需要监控这些资源的组件并推断其对外部环境的响应行为，但由于数据隐私问题，设备级测量对电力系统运营商不可见，阻碍了负荷识别的准确建模。

Method: 采用双层迭代求解框架，开发了数据驱动的逆优化算法来识别储能类组件的参数，提出了物理启发模型来识别其余组件的容量和响应。

Result: 通过数值测试验证了所提方法的建模准确性和鲁棒性，并在电力市场出清中验证了所提BTM识别方法在降低系统运行成本方面的应用意义。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效解决了BTM组件分解问题，为电力系统运营商提供了在不侵犯数据隐私的情况下准确建模负荷识别的方法。

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of behind-the-meter (BTM) resources, it is
vital to monitor the components of these resources and deduce their response
behavior to external environment. Owing to data privacy, however, the
appliance-wise measurement is invisible to the power system operator, which
hinders the accurate modeling of load identification. To this end, this paper
proposes a hybrid physics-inspired and data-driven framework for decomposing
BTM components based on external measurement of total load and environmental
factors. The total load is decomposed into different environment-dependent
components, namely storage-like component, PV generation component,
thermostatically-controlled load component, and periodic component. The overall
load identification adopts a double-layer iterative solution framework. A
data-driven inverse optimization algorithm is developed to identify parameters
of the energy storage-like component. The physics-inspired model is proposed to
identify the capacity and response of the rest components. The modeling
accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are validated by numerical
tests. The application significance of the proposed BTM identification method
is also validated in electricity market clearing for reducing system operation
costs.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个集成代理模拟和多标准决策的建模框架，用于评估使用风能和太阳能发电的绿色氢生产策略，在丹麦案例研究中比较三种运营策略和不同电解槽容量水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 向净零能源系统转型需要可扩展且成本效益高的Power-to-X技术部署，特别是绿色氢生产。现有研究大多依赖静态技术经济模型，忽视了参与者互动、基础设施限制和监管复杂性。

Method: 集成代理模拟与多标准决策的建模框架，在丹麦案例研究中应用三种运营策略（仅电网、仅现场、混合）和三种电解槽容量水平（10MW、50MW、100MW），使用真实电价、排放因子和市场数据。

Result: 混合策略在成本和排放方面始终优于仅电网配置，同时保持稳定的氢输出。仅现场策略虽能最小化排放和成本，但无法满足固定生产需求。

Conclusion: 该框架通过建模动态参与者互动和将系统性能评估集成到战略规划中提供了新颖的科学贡献，为能源规划者和政策制定者在可再生能源丰富环境中设计弹性和高效的Power-to-X系统提供了可行见解。

Abstract: The transition toward net-zero energy systems requires scalable and
cost-effective deployment of Power-to-X technologies, particularly green
hydrogen production. Despite increasing investments, a critical research gap
remains in dynamically assessing how different operational strategies affect
the feasibility of hydrogen production under real-world energy market
conditions. Most existing studies rely on static, techno-economic models and
overlook actor interactions, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory
complexity. This paper presents a novel modeling framework that integrates
agent-based simulation with multi-criteria decision-making to evaluate green
hydrogen production strategies using co-located wind and solar generation.
Three operational strategies - grid-only, on-site-only, and hybrid - are
applied across three electrolyzer capacity levels (10 MW, 50 MW, and 100 MW)
within a Danish case study. Real electricity tariffs, emissions factors, and
market data are used to simulate technical, economic, and environmental
performance indicators. The results show that hybrid strategies consistently
outperform grid-only configurations in terms of cost and emissions while
maintaining stable hydrogen output. Although on-site-only strategies minimize
emissions and costs, they fail to meet fixed production demands. This framework
offers novel scientific contributions by modeling dynamic actor interactions
and integrating system performance evaluation into strategic planning.
Practically, it provides actionable insights for energy planners and
policymakers designing resilient and efficient Power-to-X systems in
renewable-rich contexts.

Result: 数值仿真验证了所提出的理论发现，证明了信息不完整性可以有效降低攻击的隐蔽能力。

Conclusion: 信息不完整性是防御数据注入攻击的有效策略，通过系统性地控制信息不完整性可以优化攻击性能的降低效果。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Data Injections Attacks (DIAs) critically depends on the
completeness of the system information accessible to adversaries. This
relationship positions information incompleteness enhancement as a vital
defense strategy for degrading DIA performance. In this paper, we focus on the
information-theoretic stealth attacks, where the attacker encounters a
fundamental tradeoff between the attack stealthiness and destructiveness.
Specifically, we systematically characterize how incomplete admittance
information impacts the dual objectives. In particular, we establish sufficient
conditions for two distinct operational regimes: (i) stealthiness intensifies
while destructive potential diminishes and (ii) destructiveness increases while
stealth capability weakens. For scenarios beyond these regimes, we propose a
maximal incompleteness strategy to optimally degrade stealth capability. To
solve the associated optimization problem, the feasible region is reduced
without excluding the optimal solution, and a heuristic algorithm is then
introduced to effectively identify the near-optimal solutions within the
reduced region. Numerical simulations are conducted on IEEE test systems to
validate the findings.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在无明确3D环境知识情况下联合构建波束图和环境几何，显著提升了MIMO系统的性能表现。

Abstract: As communication networks evolve towards greater complexity (e.g., 6G and
beyond), a deep understanding of the wireless environment becomes increasingly
crucial. When explicit knowledge of the environment is unavailable,
geometry-aware feature extraction from channel state information (CSI) emerges
as a pivotal methodology to bridge physical-layer measurements with network
intelligence. This paper proposes to explore the received signal strength (RSS)
data, without explicit 3D environment knowledge, to jointly construct the radio
beam map and environmental geometry for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
system. Unlike existing methods that only learn blockage structures, we propose
an oriented virtual obstacle model that captures the geometric features of both
blockage and reflection. Reflective zones are formulated to identify relevant
reflected paths according to the geometry relation of the environment. We
derive an analytical expression for the reflective zone and further analyze its
geometric characteristics to develop a reformulation that is more compatible
with deep learning representations. A physics-informed deep learning framework
that incorporates the reflective-zone-based geometry model is proposed to learn
the blockage, reflection, and scattering components, along with the beam
pattern, which leverages physics prior knowledge to enhance network
transferability. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in addition to
reconstructing the blockage and reflection geometry, the proposed model can
construct a more accurate MIMO beam map with a 32%-48% accuracy improvement.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel data-driven stochastic MPC design for
discrete-time nonlinear systems with additive disturbances by leveraging the
Koopman operator and a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. By
lifting the dynamical system into a linear space, we achieve a
finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator. We explicitly account
for the modeling approximation and additive disturbance error by a mixed
stochastic-deterministic tube for the lifted linear model. This ensures the
regulation of the original nonlinear system while complying with the
prespecified constraints. Stochastic and deterministic tubes are constructed
using a DRO and a hyper-cube hull, respectively. We provide finite sample error
bounds for both types of tubes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through numerical simulations.

Conclusion: 基于广义Clarke导数的预测性安全滤波器设计为处理非光滑系统和约束的安全控制提供了有效解决方案，同时通过显式近似实现了计算效率的提升。

Abstract: Obtaining control barrier functions (CBFs) with large safe sets for complex
nonlinear systems and constraints is a challenging task. Predictive CBFs
address this issue by using an online finite-horizon optimal control problem
that implicitly defines a large safe set. The optimal control problem, also
known as the predictive safety filter (PSF), involves predicting the system's
flow under a given backup control policy. However, for non-smooth systems and
constraints, some key elements, such as CBF gradients and the sensitivity of
the flow, are not well-defined, making the current methods inadequate for
ensuring safety. Additionally, for control-non-affine systems, the PSF is
generally nonlinear and non-convex, posing challenges for real-time
computation. This paper considers piecewise affine systems, which are usually
control-non-affine, under nonlinear state and polyhedral input constraints. We
solve the safety issue by incorporating set-valued generalized Clarke
derivatives in the PSF design. We show that enforcing CBF constraints across
all elements of the generalized Clarke derivatives suffices to guarantee
safety. Moreover, to lighten the computational overhead, we propose an explicit
approximation of the PSF. The resulting control methods are demonstrated
through numerical examples.

Conclusion: 所提出的拍卖责任分配方法有效解决了多智能体安全滤波器的可扩展性问题，实现了安全与效率的平衡

Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable decentralized safety filter for multi-agent
systems based on high-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs) and
auction-based responsibility allocation. While decentralized HOCBF formulations
ensure pairwise safety under input bounds, they face feasibility and
scalability challenges as the number of agents grows. Each agent must evaluate
an increasing number of pairwise constraints, raising the risk of infeasibility
and making it difficult to meet real-time requirements. To address this, we
introduce an auction-based allocation scheme that distributes constraint
enforcement asymmetrically among neighbors based on local control effort
estimates. The resulting directed responsibility graph guarantees full safety
coverage while reducing redundant constraints and per-agent computational load.
Simulation results confirm safe and efficient coordination across a range of
network sizes and interaction densities.

Abstract: Generalized Nash equilibria are used in multi-agent control applications to
model strategic interactions between agents that are coupled in the cost,
dynamics, and constraints. We study the properties of open-loop GNE
trajectories from a system-theoretic perspective. We show how strict
dissipativity generates the turnpike phenomenon in GNE solutions. Moreover, we
establish a converse turnpike result, i.e., the implication from turnpike to
strict dissipativity. We derive conditions under which the steady-state GNE is
the optimal operating point and, using a game value function, we give a local
characterization of the geometry of storage functions. Finally, we design
linear terminal penalties that ensure GNE open-loop trajectories converge to
and remain at the steady-state GNE. These connections provide the foundation
for future system-theoretic analysis of GNEs similar to those existing in
optimal control.

Abstract: This paper focuses on rate-limited control of the generalized
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process where the control action can be either
multiplicative or additive, and the noise variance can depend on the control
action. We derive a lower bound on the data rate necessary to achieve the
desired control cost. The lower bound is attained with equality if the control
is performed via an additive white Gaussian channel. The system model
approximates the dynamics of a discrete-state molecular birth-death process,
and the result has direct implications on the control of a biomolecular system
via chemical reactions, where the multiplicative control corresponds to the
degradation rate, the additive control corresponds to the production rate, and
the control objective is to decrease the fluctuations of the controlled
molecular species around their desired concentration levels.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, AI-driven framework for fundamental investing that
integrates macro indicators, industry-level and firm-specific information to
construct optimized equity portfolios. The architecture comprises: (i) a Macro
agent that dynamically screens and weights sectors based on evolving economic
indicators and industry performance; (ii) four firm-level agents --
Fundamental, Technical, Report, and News -- that conduct in-depth analyses of
individual firms to ensure both breadth and depth of coverage; (iii) a
Portfolio agent that uses reinforcement learning to combine the agent outputs
into a unified policy to generate the trading strategy; and (iv) a Risk Control
agent that adjusts portfolio positions in response to market volatility. We
evaluate the system on the constituents by the CSI 300 Index of China's A-share
market and find that it consistently outperforms standard benchmarks and a
state-of-the-art multi-agent trading system on risk-adjusted returns and
drawdown control. Our core contribution is a hierarchical multi-agent design
that links top-down macro screening with bottom-up fundamental analysis,
offering a robust and extensible approach to factor-based portfolio
construction.

### [56] [Exponential Convergence Guarantees for Iterative Markovian Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20871)
*Marta Gentiloni Silveri,Giovanni Conforti,Alain Durmus*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文首次为迭代马尔可夫拟合(IMF)方法提供了非渐近指数收敛保证，在参考测度和边缘分布的温和结构假设下，假设足够大的时间范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然先前工作已建立了IMF的渐近收敛保证，但对其定量、非渐近的理解仍然未知。

Method: 基于马尔可夫投影算子的新收缩结果进行分析，涵盖边缘分布为对数凹和弱对数凹两种关键机制。

Result: 在温和结构假设下，IMF方法呈现指数收敛特性，为DSBM的理论保证铺平道路。

Conclusion: 该分析为理解IMF的收敛行为提供了首个非渐近理论框架，并为扩散薛定谔桥匹配方法奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem has become a fundamental tool in
computational optimal transport and generative modeling. To address this
problem, ideal methods such as Iterative Proportional Fitting and Iterative
Markovian Fitting (IMF) have been proposed-alongside practical approximations
like Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge and its Matching (DSBM) variant. While
previous work have established asymptotic convergence guarantees for IMF, a
quantitative, non-asymptotic understanding remains unknown. In this paper, we
provide the first non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees for IMF
under mild structural assumptions on the reference measure and marginal
distributions, assuming a sufficiently large time horizon. Our results
encompass two key regimes: one where the marginals are log-concave, and another
where they are weakly log-concave. The analysis relies on new contraction
results for the Markovian projection operator and paves the way to theoretical
guarantees for DSBM.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种在再生核希尔伯特空间中进行对抗训练的新方法，将输入空间扰动转换为特征空间扰动，从而能够精确求解内层最大化问题并实现高效优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗训练方法依赖计算成本高昂的min-max问题，限制了实际应用。需要找到更高效的对抗训练方法。

Method: 在再生核希尔伯特空间中重新表述对抗训练，将输入扰动转换为特征空间扰动，提出基于迭代核岭回归的高效优化算法，并扩展到多核学习。

Result: 该方法在干净和对抗性设置下都表现出良好性能，提供了正则化估计器，能够自然适应噪声水平和底层函数的平滑度。

Conclusion: 提出的特征空间扰动对抗训练方法能够高效解决传统min-max问题，具有良好的泛化性能，为对抗训练提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Adversarial training has emerged as a key technique to enhance model
robustness against adversarial input perturbations. Many of the existing
methods rely on computationally expensive min-max problems that limit their
application in practice. We propose a novel formulation of adversarial training
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, shifting from input to feature-space
perturbations. This reformulation enables the exact solution of inner
maximization and efficient optimization. It also provides a regularized
estimator that naturally adapts to the noise level and the smoothness of the
underlying function. We establish conditions under which the feature-perturbed
formulation is a relaxation of the original problem and propose an efficient
optimization algorithm based on iterative kernel ridge regression. We provide
generalization bounds that help to understand the properties of the method. We
also extend the formulation to multiple kernel learning. Empirical evaluation
shows good performance in both clean and adversarial settings.

Motivation: 随着敏感属性数量增加，子群数量激增导致计算负担加重和数据稀疏问题（子群样本过少），需要新的算法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出子群子集公平性概念和supIPM分布公平性度量，开发DRAF算法通过双重回归对抗学习减少代理公平性差距，比直接优化supIPM计算量更小。

Conclusion: DRAF算法有效解决了多敏感属性下的子群公平性计算和数据稀疏问题，为大规模公平性学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness is a socially crucial topic in real-world applications
of AI.
  Among many notions of fairness, subgroup fairness is widely studied when
multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age) are present.
  However, as the number of sensitive attributes grows, the number of subgroups
increases accordingly, creating heavy computational burdens and data sparsity
problem (subgroups with too small sizes).
  In this paper, we develop a novel learning algorithm for subgroup fairness
which resolves these issues by focusing on subgroups with sufficient sample
sizes as well as marginal fairness (fairness for each sensitive attribute).
  To this end, we formalize a notion of subgroup-subset fairness and introduce
a corresponding distributional fairness measure called the supremum Integral
Probability Metric (supIPM).
  Building on this formulation, we propose the Doubly Regressing Adversarial
learning for subgroup Fairness (DRAF) algorithm, which reduces a surrogate
fairness gap for supIPM with much less computation than directly reducing
supIPM.
  Theoretically, we prove that the proposed surrogate fairness gap is an upper
bound of supIPM.
  Empirically, we show that the DRAF algorithm outperforms baseline methods in
benchmark datasets, specifically when the number of sensitive attributes is
large so that many subgroups are very small.

*Naomi Desobry,Elnura Zhalieva,Souhaib Ben Taieb*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于多输出回归中实现多元校准的通用正则化框架，通过惩罚投影概率积分变换与均匀分布的偏差来强制校准，可显著改善校准效果而不牺牲预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多输出回归中的多元校准比单输出回归更具挑战性，现有方法主要关注基于预排序函数的诊断工具，但缺乏在训练过程中强制校准的方法。

Method: 引入一个通用正则化框架，通过惩罚投影概率积分变换(PITs)与均匀分布的偏差来强制多元校准，可添加到任何概率预测器的损失函数中。还提出了新的基于PCA的预排序函数。

Result: 在18个真实世界多输出回归数据集上的实验表明，未正则化模型普遍存在校准问题，而所提方法能显著改善所有预排序函数的校准效果，同时保持预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为多输出回归中的多元校准提供了一种有效的正则化方法，能够显著改善校准性能而不影响预测精度。

Abstract: Probabilistic models must be well calibrated to support reliable
decision-making. While calibration in single-output regression is well studied,
defining and achieving multivariate calibration in multi-output regression
remains considerably more challenging. The existing literature on multivariate
calibration primarily focuses on diagnostic tools based on pre-rank functions,
which are projections that reduce multivariate prediction-observation pairs to
univariate summaries to detect specific types of miscalibration. In this work,
we go beyond diagnostics and introduce a general regularization framework to
enforce multivariate calibration during training for arbitrary pre-rank
functions. This framework encompasses existing approaches such as highest
density region calibration and copula calibration. Our method enforces
calibration by penalizing deviations of the projected probability integral
transforms (PITs) from the uniform distribution, and can be added as a
regularization term to the loss function of any probabilistic predictor.
Specifically, we propose a regularization loss that jointly enforces both
marginal and multivariate pre-rank calibration. We also introduce a new
PCA-based pre-rank that captures calibration along directions of maximal
variance in the predictive distribution, while also enabling dimensionality
reduction. Across 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that
unregularized models are consistently miscalibrated, and that our methods
significantly improve calibration across all pre-rank functions without
sacrificing predictive accuracy.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了组合半赌博机问题的oracle高效框架，将oracle查询次数从线性降低到对数级别，同时保持紧密的遗憾保证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合半赌博机问题虽然应用广泛，但组合优化的高成本限制了其可扩展性，需要在每轮进行oracle查询

Method: 开发了oracle高效算法框架，包括针对最坏情况线性奖励的算法和利用噪声结构的协方差自适应算法

Result: 在最坏情况线性奖励设置下，实现了$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$遗憾，仅需$O(\log\log T)$次oracle查询；将oracle使用从线性降低到（双重）对数级别

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著减少了oracle使用，同时保持了强大的理论保证，扩展了组合半赌博机问题的实用性

Abstract: We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem where an agent selects a
subset of base arms and receives individual feedback. While this generalizes
the classical multi-armed bandit and has broad applicability, its scalability
is limited by the high cost of combinatorial optimization, requiring oracle
queries at every round. To tackle this, we propose oracle-efficient frameworks
that significantly reduce oracle calls while maintaining tight regret
guarantees. For the worst-case linear reward setting, our algorithms achieve
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret using only $O(\log\log T)$ oracle queries. We also
propose covariance-adaptive algorithms that leverage noise structure for
improved regret, and extend our approach to general (non-linear) rewards.
Overall, our methods reduce oracle usage from linear to (doubly) logarithmic in
time, with strong theoretical guarantees.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: HollowFlow是一种基于流的生成模型，通过非回溯图神经网络实现常数级计算复杂度，解决了传统流模型在大规模系统中似然计算的高昂成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流模型和扩散模型在科学应用中面临计算瓶颈，特别是Boltzmann生成器在大规模系统中因似然计算复杂度随系统规模增长而变得不可行。

Method: 使用非回溯图神经网络(NoBGNN)构建HollowFlow模型，通过强制块对角Jacobian结构，使似然计算仅需常数次反向传播，实现O(n²)加速。

Result: 在两个不同规模的系统上验证，采样和似然评估时间显著减少，遵循理论缩放规律，在较大系统上获得100倍加速。

Conclusion: HollowFlow框架为之前受计算瓶颈限制的高维科学问题提供了可行解决方案，任何等变GNN或注意力架构都可适配为NoBGNN。

Abstract: Flow and diffusion-based models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific
applications, particularly for sampling non-normalized probability
distributions, as exemplified by Boltzmann Generators (BGs). A critical
challenge in deploying these models is their reliance on sample likelihood
computations, which scale prohibitively with system size $n$, often rendering
them infeasible for large-scale problems. To address this, we introduce
$\textit{HollowFlow}$, a flow-based generative model leveraging a novel
non-backtracking graph neural network (NoBGNN). By enforcing a block-diagonal
Jacobian structure, HollowFlow likelihoods are evaluated with a constant number
of backward passes in $n$, yielding speed-ups of up to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$: a
significant step towards scaling BGs to larger systems. Crucially, our
framework generalizes: $\textbf{any equivariant GNN or attention-based
architecture}$ can be adapted into a NoBGNN. We validate HollowFlow by training
BGs on two different systems of increasing size. For both systems, the sampling
and likelihood evaluation time decreases dramatically, following our
theoretical scaling laws. For the larger system we obtain a $10^2\times$
speed-up, clearly illustrating the potential of HollowFlow-based approaches for
high-dimensional scientific problems previously hindered by computational
bottlenecks.

Motivation: 需要开发既具有高表达能力又易于处理的变分推断方法，以建模具有偏斜、重尾和多峰特性的复杂分布。

Method: 将加权专家乘积重新表述为带有辅助狄利克雷潜变量的模型，使用费曼恒等式实现采样，并通过凸二次规划优化专家权重。

Result: 该方法能够有效近似各种合成和真实世界中的目标分布，权重更新算法在一般条件下指数快速收敛到接近最优解。

Conclusion: 提出的加权专家乘积方法为黑盒变分推断提供了一个强大而实用的工具，能够处理复杂的分布特性。

Abstract: We introduce a highly expressive yet distinctly tractable family for
black-box variational inference (BBVI). Each member of this family is a
weighted product of experts (PoE), and each weighted expert in the product is
proportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. These products of experts can
model distributions with skew, heavy tails, and multiple modes, but to use them
for BBVI, we must be able to sample from their densities. We show how to do
this by reformulating these products of experts as latent variable models with
auxiliary Dirichlet random variables. These Dirichlet variables emerge from a
Feynman identity, originally developed for loop integrals in quantum field
theory, that expresses the product of multiple fractions (or in our case,
$t$-distributions) as an integral over the simplex. We leverage this simplicial
latent space to draw weighted samples from these products of experts -- samples
which BBVI then uses to find the PoE that best approximates a target density.
Given a collection of experts, we derive an iterative procedure to optimize the
exponents that determine their geometric weighting in the PoE. At each
iteration, this procedure minimizes a regularized Fisher divergence to match
the scores of the variational and target densities at a batch of samples drawn
from the current approximation. This minimization reduces to a convex quadratic
program, and we prove under general conditions that these updates converge
exponentially fast to a near-optimal weighting of experts. We conclude by
evaluating this approach on a variety of synthetic and real-world target
distributions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种人机协作流程，将手绘平面图转换为3D BIM模型，使用多模态大语言模型和多代理框架，通过迭代反馈实现高精度建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让BIM创建对专家和非专家都更加易用，仅需手绘草图即可生成语义一致的3D BIM模型。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型的多代理框架，结合感知提取、人工反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成，将草图迭代优化为结构化JSON布局，再转换为可执行脚本生成3D模型。

Result: 在10个不同平面图上测试显示：门窗开口在初次处理中即可高可靠捕获，墙体检测从83%开始，经过几次反馈迭代后达到近乎完美对齐；所有类别的精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过0.83，几何误差通过反馈修正逐步降至零。

Conclusion: MLLM驱动的多代理推理能够使BIM创建对专家和非专家都更加易用，仅需手绘草图即可实现。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在开放领域艺术创作中要么陷入熟悉文化模式，要么在追求新颖性时牺牲连贯性的问题。

Method: 使用两个GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念在艺术作品中是否合理共存，文化背景模型估计这些组合在艺术家作品中的典型性。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的概念组合。

Result: 在人类评估中优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，与艺术专业学生表现相当；定量研究显示比GPT-4o产生更多样化的输出和更广泛的概念探索。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化可以释放自主代理的创造潜力，在保持内部一致性的同时生成偏离文化惯例的新颖想法。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模糊数表示方法——外延模糊数，以解决传统模糊数运算中的计算复杂度高、结果特征不一致和模糊扩散问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊数使用模糊集表示，但基于Zadeh扩展原理的运算存在三个主要问题：计算复杂度高、某些运算结果不保持原始特征（如两个三角模糊数相乘结果不是三角模糊数）、模糊扩散问题。这些问题限制了模糊数的应用范围。

Method: 提出外延模糊数的概念，定义了外延模糊数的运算方法（加、减、乘、除等）和关系运算符（=、>、>=、<、<=），并通过应用实例进行说明。

Result: 开发了C++实现并在GitHub上公开可用，通过多个应用示例验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数方法能够有效解决传统模糊数运算中的问题，为模糊数的实际应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

Result: 在5个诊所的25,605条记录上评估，Qwen2.5-32B模型达到93.4%的覆盖率和93.0%的精确匹配准确率，MedGemma-27B达到93.1%/92.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了脆弱的站点特定ETL流程，支持本地隐私保护部署，实现了真实环境中MOUD暴露、依从性和保留率的一致跨站点分析。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

Motivation: 研究动机是确定在什么情况下AI系统应被视为人工认知权威，以及如何合理地在AI输出和人类专家判断之间做出权衡，特别是在高风险环境中。

Method: 作者通过社会认识论框架分析AI系统的认知权威地位，批判AI优先主义观点，并发展出基于总体证据的AI遵从理论。

Result: 研究结果表明，将AI输出视为贡献性理由而非完全替代品具有三个关键优势：减缓专业知识萎缩、为有意义的人类监督提供认知依据、解释AI不可靠时的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 结论是总体证据方法为确定何时AI遵从是合理的提供了原则性指导，特别是在需要严格可靠性的高风险情境中，尽管在实践中要求较高。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体框架，将自然语言问题准确转换为空间SQL查询，通过知识库、语义增强和协作式多智能体管道提升空间Text-to-SQL性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SQL复杂性和PostGIS等地理空间工具的专业性对非专家用户的障碍，克服单智能体方法在处理空间查询语义和语法复杂性时的困难

Method: 集成知识库（包含程序化模式分析和语义增强）、上下文检索嵌入、协作式多智能体管道（实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成、程序化和语义验证的审查智能体）

Result: 在KaggleDBQA上达到81.2%准确率（272题中221题正确），在空间查询上达到87.7%准确率（90题中79题正确），比无审查智能体的76.7%显著提升

Conclusion: 使空间分析更易访问，为空间Text-to-SQL系统提供稳健可推广的基础，推动自主GIS发展

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

TL;DR: MedAlign是一个用于医学视觉问答的创新框架，通过多模态直接偏好优化、检索感知专家混合架构和联邦治理机制，解决大型视觉语言模型在医疗应用中的幻觉问题、推理效率低下和多机构协作困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在智能医疗领域具有潜力，但面临三个关键挑战：产生基于视觉证据的幻觉答案、固定深度推理效率低下、多机构协作困难。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化(mDPO)目标，使偏好学习与视觉上下文对齐；设计检索感知专家混合(RA-MoE)架构，通过图像和文本相似度将查询路由到专业专家；采用联邦治理机制，让选定的专家基于本地元认知不确定性估计器执行迭代思维链推理。

Result: 在三个代表性Med-VQA数据集上的实验表明，MedAlign达到最先进性能，比强检索增强基线在F1分数上提升高达11.85%，同时相比固定深度CoT方法平均推理长度减少51.60%。

Conclusion: MedAlign框架有效解决了LVLM在医疗应用中的关键挑战，实现了视觉准确响应、自适应推理和多机构协作，为智能医疗部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Motivation: 在复杂高维领域中，当无法先验排除未观测混杂因素时，需要开发能够处理偏倚数据的离策略学习方法。

Method: 基于深度Q网络(DQN)，提出一种新颖的深度强化学习算法，寻找与观测兼容的最坏环境中的安全策略。

Result: 在12个存在混杂的Atari游戏上测试，该方法在所有存在行为策略与目标策略输入不匹配且存在未观测混杂因素的游戏中，始终优于标准DQN。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效处理观测数据中的混杂偏倚，在存在未观测混杂因素的环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恐慌发作是急性恐惧和痛苦发作，及时干预能显著帮助个体恢复稳定，但训练此类模型的合适数据集因伦理和后勤问题而稀缺。

Method: 引入PACE数据集构建高痛苦发作的第一人称叙述，基于心理急救原则训练PACER咨询模型，通过监督学习和模拟偏好对齐优化。

Result: 实验结果显示PACER在咨询师侧指标和客户情感改善方面均优于强基线模型，人类评估进一步确认其在恐慌场景中的实用价值。

Conclusion: PACER在恐慌发作场景中持续优于通用、CBT基础和GPT-4驱动的模型，证明了该方法在心理急救干预中的有效性。

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

TL;DR: 提出了NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，在RAG系统中实现高效知识投毒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG投毒攻击主要关注检索内容或提示结构操作，忽略了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑与强参数化知识的知识冲突问题。

Method: 首先识别与上下文投毒知识强相关的毒物响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过观察到的归因信号重用有前景但初始不成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法能持续实现超过90%的群体覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决知识冲突问题，通过神经元引导的投毒在RAG系统中实现高效知识覆盖。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了EGO-Prompt框架，通过进化图优化自动设计更好的提示和推理过程，在领域特定任务中显著提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中为LLM设计领域特定任务的最优提示和推理过程是必要且具有挑战性的，如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率以及为领域专家提供知识整合提示是尚未解决的关键问题。

Method: EGO-Prompt从专家构建的初始语义因果图(SCG)开始，通过两步骤的因果引导文本梯度过程：首先生成确定性推理指导，然后使LLM适应使用该指导与原始输入。迭代优化算法使用文本梯度和真实标签进一步优化SCG和推理机制。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务上测试，EGO-Prompt比最先进方法F1分数提高7.32%-12.61%，使小模型以不到20%的成本达到大模型性能，并输出精炼的领域特定SCG提高可解释性。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt是一个有效的自动化框架，能够优化提示设计、提高推理效率，并为领域专家提供因果信息增强的过程，在多个实际任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出String Seed of Thought (SSoT)方法，通过让LLM先生成随机字符串来增加熵，然后从中提取随机性选择答案，显著改善了概率指令跟随(PIF)性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在处理需要从预定义选项集合中按特定概率分布选择答案的PIF任务时表现不佳，存在偏见问题，影响非确定性行为应用如人类行为模拟、内容多样化和多人游戏，也损害生成响应的多样性。

Method: SSoT提示方法：先让LLM输出随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来推导最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵循特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLM的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能；在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务的响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能够解决LLM在概率指令跟随任务中的偏见问题，提升输出多样性，适用于需要非确定性行为的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临分布偏移和新任务挑战，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法来适应环境变化同时避免遗忘。

Method: 采用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已学知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效保护零样本迁移能力，在持续学习基准上取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL为现实应用中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型提供实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有因果关系发现方法依赖人工经验、统计方法或图形标准方法，容易出错、依赖理想化假设和大量数据，且在少样本多变量时间序列中容易过拟合。

Method: 使用组扩张卷积和共享核来指数级减少参数数量，同时学习带时间延迟的变量表示；结合全局和局部约束实现网络间信息共享。

Result: 在常用基准测试和生成数据集上的大量实验表明，Shylock在少样本和正常多变量时间序列上都优于两种现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Shylock方法有效解决了多变量时间序列因果关系发现中的少样本问题，并开发了Tcausal库便于使用，已部署在EarthDataMiner平台上。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度敏感，在具有密集奖励的游戏中，不同游戏的Q值跨度差异很大，需要一种对奖励尺度不敏感的λ选择策略。

Method: 评估了文献中提出的λ策略以及五种新策略，包括选择λ作为搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值经验标准差的2倍。

Result: 新提出的λ=2σ策略在各种任务中都优于现有λ策略，无论是在单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数获得的峰值性能方面。

Conclusion: 推荐使用λ=2σ策略作为UCT探索常数的自适应选择方法，该方法对游戏奖励尺度不敏感且性能优越。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

TL;DR: 论文发现大型推理模型存在自我越狱现象，并提出Chain-of-Guardrail训练框架来改善安全性与推理能力的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全缓解策略依赖启发式安全信号注入，往往抑制推理能力且无法解决安全-推理权衡问题。

Method: 分析推理轨迹发现自我越狱现象，提出Chain-of-Guardrail框架，通过重组或回溯不安全推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试中，CoG显著提高了当前LRMs的安全性，同时保持相当的推理能力，明显优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全-推理权衡问题，证明了在保持推理能力的同时显著提升安全性的可行性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过范围综述分析了AIES和FAccT会议中关于可信AI的研究现状，发现当前研究过于技术中心化，忽视了社会技术维度，提出了需要结合技术严谨性与社会文化因素的综合框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可信AI研究主要关注技术属性（可靠性、鲁棒性、公平性），而忽视了理解AI在现实环境中可信度所需的社会技术维度。

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度的定义、操作化和应用方式，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术和应用领域。

Result: 研究发现虽然透明度、问责制和鲁棒性等技术属性定义取得进展，但当前研究过度强调技术精确性而牺牲社会伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质探索不足，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的有争议概念。

Conclusion: 需要结合技术严谨性与社会、文化、制度考量的跨学科方法，提出AI伦理社区应采用综合框架，真正解决AI系统与社会之间复杂相互作用，促进对所有利益相关者有益的负责任技术发展。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

*Sanghyun Ahn,Wonje Choi,Junyong Lee,Jinwoo Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经符号具身任务规划框架，通过符号验证和交互验证过程增强代码生成的环境基础，在动态或部分可观测环境中显著提高任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观测环境中存在环境基础不足的问题，导致任务成功率较低，需要改进代码生成的环境基础。

Method: 采用神经符号框架，包含显式符号验证和交互验证过程，在验证阶段生成探索性代码与环境交互获取缺失观测，同时保持任务相关状态。

Result: 在RLBench和真实世界动态部分可观测场景中，任务成功率比Code-as-Policies基线提高46.2%，任务相关动作可执行性达到86.8%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架通过集成验证过程增强了生成代码的环境基础，提高了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CXR分析模型难以适应新的诊断任务和复杂推理场景，现有智能体依赖单一诊断流程且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制。

Method: 采用导演协调的三阶段方法：工具调用（带证据驱动验证器）、诊断规划（组建专家团队）、协作决策（整合专家见解和上下文记忆）。

Result: 在各种CXR解释任务上表现出色，能提供视觉证据，并能很好地推广到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作和证据验证机制，显著提升了CXR分析的适应性、可信度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

TL;DR: 提出一个结合强化学习的框架，通过提高标记效率来提升1.5B模型在数学推理任务上的性能，相比仅使用监督微调的方法，在GSM8K数据集上获得了更高准确率并显著减少40%以上的标记使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放方法虽然计算效率高且参数无关训练，但预算强制方法依赖于对长上下文推理轨迹的监督微调，这会导致较小模型因冗长响应而性能下降。

Method: 集成强化学习框架，仅使用1.5K训练样本，结合监督微调和强化学习来优化模型性能。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，SFT+RL模型在不同计算预算下表现更好，整体准确率更高，同时标记使用量相比SFT模型减少超过40%。

Conclusion: 强化学习可以恢复因长上下文训练造成的损失，并整体提升数学推理性能，展示了RL在提高标记效率和模型性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在关键领域表现出色但缺乏透明度，现有神经符号AI方法不适合LLMs特性，需要系统性理解符号AI如何有效集成到LLMs中。

Method: 首先回顾已建立的神经符号AI方法，然后提出LLM中符号集成的新分类法，包括四个维度：LLM不同阶段的符号集成、耦合机制、架构范式、算法和应用层面视角。

Result: 开发了新的分类框架，组织现有文献，识别当前基准、前沿进展和关键差距。

Conclusion: 通过突出最新发展和文献中的显著差距，为将符号集成框架实施到LLMs中以增强透明度提供了实用见解和未来研究路线图。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数学优化问题通常需要专业知识，开发自动化系统来直接从图像识别并求解优化问题，降低用户门槛。

Method: 使用AutoOpt-11k数据集训练深度学习模型，构建三模块框架：图像转LaTeX、LaTeX转PYOMO脚本、优化求解。

Result: MER模型在BLEU得分上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂问题上比内点法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt框架能够有效自动化求解优化问题，为优化领域提供了实用的自动化工具。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在处理多任务VRP时通常学习统一求解器，但未能充分利用VRP变体的组合结构，错失了专门基础求解器的潜在优势。

Method: 提出状态可分解MDP(SDMDP)将状态空间表示为基础状态空间的笛卡尔积，开发潜在空间扩展，并通过MoSES实现基础策略的专门LoRA专家和自适应门控混合函数。

Result: 在多个VRP变体上的广泛实验表明，MoSES优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用基础求解器的专门知识和组合结构，MoSES框架能够有效提升多任务VRP的求解性能，同时避免神经网络求解器的指数级增长。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

Motivation: 随着LLM作为代理在各种场景中部署，它们可能表现出不可预测的行为，包括采取不良和/或不安全的行动。需要测量LLM代理在欧盟立法背景下采取非法行为的潜在倾向。

Method: 创建了一个可验证的人工策划基准测试，涵盖数据保护、偏见/歧视和科学诚信等多个类别场景。通过将模型的函数调用与详尽法律引用支持的标准进行对比来评估法律合规性。

Conclusion: 鼓励未来工作将代理安全基准扩展到不同法律管辖区以及多轮和多语言交互，并发布了公共预览集和代码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证(CAMV)和可信推理结构化事实(TRSF)机制，将推理转化为可证伪和可审计的过程，解决了LLM智能体长程推理中验证不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体的长程推理失败往往不是生成能力不足，而是中间推理验证不够充分，需要建立可证伪和可审计的推理过程。

Method: 使用CAMV将验证重构为冲突识别和定向证伪，只在专家智能体间的不一致热点分配计算；TRSF通过结构化事实模块持续组织、验证和同步证据。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%的准确率，Humanity's Last Exam上35.5%，Chinese-SimpleQA上93.8%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为LLM智能体提供了可扩展的可靠长程推理范式，结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用驱动了性能提升。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用模仿学习训练神经控制屏障函数的方法，通过专家演示数据来学习安全约束，避免需要明确指定复杂故障状态集合的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域运行的自主系统中，安全是基本要求。控制屏障函数(CBFs)常用于设计安全过滤器，但传统方法需要明确指定故障状态集合，这在某些场景中难以形式化定义（如自动驾驶中的跟车问题）。

Method: 使用模仿学习(ICL)训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全或不安全，然后利用该函数标注新的模拟轨迹来训练神经CBF。

Result: 在四个不同环境中进行实证评估，结果表明该方法优于现有基线方法，并且与使用真实安全标签训练的神经CBF性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数据驱动的神经CBF学习方法，能够从专家演示中学习安全约束，无需明确指定复杂的故障状态集合。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM

TL;DR: DeepAgent是一个端到端的深度推理智能体，通过自主思维、工具发现和行动执行在单一连贯的推理过程中完成任务。它采用自主记忆折叠机制压缩交互历史，并使用ToolPO强化学习策略高效学习通用工具使用。


<details>

Method: 提出自主记忆折叠机制，将过去交互压缩为结构化记忆（情景记忆、工作记忆、工具记忆），减少错误积累。开发ToolPO端到端强化学习策略，利用LLM模拟API，并通过工具调用优势归因对工具调用token分配细粒度信用。

Result: 在8个基准测试（包括通用工具使用任务和下游应用）上的广泛实验表明，DeepAgent在有标签工具和开放集工具检索场景中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作向构建更通用和强大的现实世界应用智能体迈出了一步。DeepAgent通过统一的推理过程和高效的记忆管理，提升了智能体的自主性和任务完成能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code
and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.

TL;DR: 提出了AstaBench基准套件，用于更严格地评估AI科学代理的能力，包含2400+个涵盖整个科学发现过程的问题，并提供可复现的评估环境和基线代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理评估基准存在不足：缺乏对真实科学研究的整体衡量、缺少可复现的工具、未考虑模型成本和工具访问等混杂变量、缺乏标准化接口、缺少全面的基线代理。

Method: 定义了更严格的代理基准原则和工具，开发了AstaBench套件，包含科学发现全过程的问题、生产级搜索工具的可复现评估环境，以及9类科学优化代理和多个基线。

Result: 对57个代理在22个代理类别上的广泛评估显示，尽管在某些方面取得了有意义的进展，但AI在解决科学研援助挑战方面仍相距甚远。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的基准来准确评估AI科学代理的能力，AstaBench为此提供了首个全面的科学发现能力评估框架。

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需限制目标本体或实体的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面的知识图谱需要使用多个本体来将数据完全语境化到特定领域。简单的一对一等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成。

Method: 使用检索增强生成选择相关类别来组成映射，并过滤匹配的参考映射作为示例来增强上下文学习。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中评估，CMOMgen在类别选择方面优于基线方法，F1分数最低达到63%，在两个任务中优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。手动评估显示46%的映射获得最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够构建语义合理的映射，在复杂多本体匹配任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业公关活动存在言行不一的问题（如石油公司的"漂绿"现象），需要大规模分析框架变化来理解公关活动的目标和性质。

Method: 构建专家标注的视频广告数据集，专门用于视觉语言模型评估，包含13种框架类型的标注。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1检测环境信息的F1分数为79%，而最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达到46% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源部门战略沟通的多模态分析研究，同时揭示了视觉语言模型需要解决的挑战，如隐式框架、视频长度变化和文化背景处理。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主代理在动态环境中的协调受到高层任务目标与低层规划输入之间语义鸿沟的阻碍，需要智能的翻译层来桥接这一差距。

Method: 引入以知识图谱为中心的框架，采用双平面架构将声明性事实编译为每个代理的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，将任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 在墨西哥湾的自主水下航行器案例研究中，可视化展示了端到端过程，并定量证明不同的声明性策略产生独特且高性能的结果。

Conclusion: 该工作确立了知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

Motivation: 传统基于皮尔逊相关的金融网络研究存在严重缺陷，可能导致误导性结果。局部高斯相关系数能捕捉局部非线性依赖和处理重尾分布，具有独特优势。

Method: 使用局部高斯相关系数构建上证A股股票收益尾部区域的金融网络，系统分析节点中心性、平均最短路径长度和熵等基本网络指标。

Result: 与正尾部局部高斯相关网络和传统皮尔逊相关网络相比，负尾部局部高斯相关网络的特性对股票市场风险更为敏感。

Conclusion: 研究者应优先考虑负尾部的局部高斯相关网络，未来工作应使用该方法重新评估现有研究结果。

Abstract: Financial networks based on Pearson correlations have been intensively
studied. However, previous studies may have led to misleading and catastrophic
results because of several critical shortcomings of the Pearson correlation.
The local Gaussian correlation coefficient, a new measurement of statistical
dependence between variables, has unique advantages including capturing local
nonlinear dependence and handling heavy-tailed distributions. This study
constructs financial networks using the local Gaussian correlation coefficients
between tail regions of stock returns in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The work
systematically analyzes fundamental network metrics including node centrality,
average shortest path length, and entropy. Compared with the local Gaussian
correlation network among positive tails and the conventional Pearson
correlation network, the properties of the local Gaussian correlation network
among negative tails are more sensitive to the stock market risks. This finding
suggests researchers should prioritize the local Gaussian correlation network
among negative tails. Future work should reevaluate existing findings using the
local Gaussian correlation method.

TL;DR: 提出基于神经网络的稳健收益率曲线估计框架，专门针对小型抵押债券市场，通过新的损失函数确保平滑性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如拔靴法和Nelson-Siegel模型）在债券数据稀疏、价格波动或噪声较大时存在过拟合或不稳定问题，需要更稳健的收益率曲线估计方法。

Method: 使用神经网络框架独立估计每日收益率曲线，引入新损失函数强制平滑性和稳定性，并可整合领域特定约束（如无风险基准对齐）。

Result: 在瑞典抵押债券上的实证结果显示，该方法比Nelson-Siegel-Svensson和Kernel-Ridge方法产生更稳健和稳定的收益率曲线估计。

Conclusion: 该神经网络框架为小型债券市场提供了有效的收益率曲线估计解决方案，允许从业者在平滑性和准确性之间进行权衡。

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

TL;DR: CESAR通过在线强化学习框架解决音频大语言模型中的推理逆缩放问题，从结果验证转向奖励推理过程，实现了最先进的音频推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型中的推理能力未被充分探索，引入推理过程往往会在推理时降低性能，出现测试时逆缩放现象，即更长的推理链导致更差的结果。

Method: 提出CESAR框架，采用在线强化学习，使用具有多方面奖励机制的组相对策略优化，激励正确性、格式、一致性、结构化分析模式、因果推理、领域知识整合和校准推理深度。

Result: 解决了测试时逆缩放问题，在MMAU Test-mini上取得最先进结果，显著优于Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio，在MMSU推理任务上接近人类水平性能。

Conclusion: CESAR为开发稳健且可扩展的音频大语言模型推理建立了原则性方法，增强的推理还产生了协同效应，同时改善了多模态推理和感知能力。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融时间序列预测面临核心挑战：预测最优资产配置需要理解危机期间变化的制度依赖相关性结构。现有基于图的方法依赖预定义图拓扑，无法适应不同危机机制下的市场动态变化。

Method: CRISP使用图卷积网络编码空间关系，BiLSTM与自注意力机制编码时间动态，通过多头图注意力网络学习稀疏结构，自动发现哪些资产关系重要，过滤92.5%的连接作为噪声。

Result: 在2005-2021年数据上训练，CRISP在2022-2024年通胀驱动市场（完全不同制度）上表现出强大泛化能力，准确预测制度适当的相关性结构，夏普比率3.76，比等权重基准提高707%，比静态图方法提高94%。

Conclusion: CRISP通过学习预测而非强加假设，实现了可解释的制度检测，防御性集群注意力在危机期间增强49% vs 市场范围的31%，展示了从学习中产生的涌现行为。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD能够有效生成多样化的帕累托最优解，在超体积性能和解多样性方面均有显著提升

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Motivation: 传统多模态学习方法存在模态不平衡问题，主导模态会压制弱模态的学习，导致弱模态的独特信息被抑制。

Method: 提出了多模态负学习框架，通过动态引导机制让主导模态指导弱模态抑制非目标类，稳定决策空间并保留模态特定信息。

Conclusion: 负学习范式能有效解决模态不平衡问题，保持弱模态的独特信息，在多模态学习中具有优越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

Conclusion: HA-RAG系统通过热感知优化策略，有效解决了RAG推理中的性能瓶颈，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data

TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoD的反事实解释增强蒸馏方法，用于解决少样本任务感知知识蒸馏中的数据稀缺问题。该方法通过注入反事实解释来精确映射教师模型的决策边界，在极少样本（8-512个）情况下显著优于标准蒸馏方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务感知蒸馏方法需要大量数据，但在实际场景中数据可能稀缺或获取成本高。本文旨在解决少样本情况下的知识蒸馏挑战。

Method: CoD策略系统性地注入反事实解释（CFEs），即能够以最小扰动翻转教师模型预测输出的输入。通过利用CFEs来精确映射教师决策边界，减少所需样本数量。

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上的实验表明，CoD在少样本情况下（8-512个样本）优于标准蒸馏方法。CoD仅使用基线方法一半的原始样本，配合相应的CFEs，仍能提升性能。

Conclusion: CoD方法通过反事实解释有效解决了少样本知识蒸馏问题，从统计和几何角度提供了理论保证，证明了CFEs在参数估计和决策边界学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于元学习的蛋白质突变性质预测方法，通过MAML实现跨数据集快速适应，并采用分隔符标记的突变编码策略，在三个蛋白质突变数据集上显著优于传统微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖针对特定数据集的蛋白质transformer微调，但由于实验条件异质性和目标域数据有限，难以实现跨数据集泛化。需要开发能够快速适应新任务的方法。

Method: 结合transformer架构与模型无关元学习(MAML)，使用分隔符标记直接编码突变到序列上下文中，通过少量梯度步骤实现快速适应，避免学习数据集特定模式。

Result: 在跨任务评估中，元学习方法在功能适应性预测上准确率提升29%，训练时间减少65%；在溶解度预测上准确率提升94%，训练时间减少55%。框架训练效率不受数据集大小影响。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了元学习在蛋白质突变分析中的系统性应用，提供了有效的突变编码策略，为蛋白质工程中的跨域泛化提供了变革性方法。

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LBS是一个结合大语言模型和贝叶斯状态空间模型的多模态时序预测框架，能够处理结构化时间序列数据和非结构化文本信息，提供灵活的时间窗口和不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界预测需要整合结构化时间序列数据和非结构化文本信息，但现有方法在架构上受限于固定的输入/输出时间范围，且无法建模或量化不确定性。

Method: LBS包含两个组件：(1)状态空间模型(SSM)骨干网络，捕捉潜在状态的时间动态；(2)预训练大语言模型(LLM)，用于编码文本输入进行后验状态估计，并解码与潜在轨迹一致的文本预测。

Result: 在TextTimeCorpus基准测试中，LBS将先前最先进方法的性能提升了13.20%，同时为每个预测提供人类可读的摘要。

Conclusion: 这是首个将LLM和SSM统一用于联合数值和文本预测的工作，为多模态时序推理提供了新的基础。

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可逆性的安全强化学习方法，通过模型预测路径积分控制来检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，无需显式动态模型或安全约束知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无模型强化学习缺乏正式安全保证，现有方法通常依赖详细的安全规范知识。本文发现许多难以明确规范的安全问题可以通过不变性来表征。

Method: 利用可逆性作为防止安全问题的机制，使用模型预测路径积分控制在整个训练过程中检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，只需能够查询黑盒动态系统。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提算法在所有不安全动作发生前成功中止，同时达到与允许违反安全的基线PPO方法相当的训练进度。

Conclusion: 该方法为强化学习提供了有效的安全保证，无需显式动态模型或安全约束知识，仅通过查询黑盒动态系统即可实现安全控制。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络中特征学习的动态过程，特别是梯度学习在高斯单指标模型中的表现。现有研究表明样本复杂度与学习率密切相关，但缺乏对学习率与样本复杂度关系的系统分析。

Method: 提出了一个统一的梯度学习算法框架，涵盖相关性和非相关性更新。引入了一种新的分层训练算法，采用双时间尺度方法（每层使用不同的学习率），无需重复使用样本或修改平方误差损失。

Result: 发现了学习率与样本复杂度之间的相变现象：小学习率时受信息指数限制，大学习率时受生成指数限制。分层训练算法能够超越相关性查询，提高学习效率。

Conclusion: 学习率的选择与算法设计同等重要，对实现统计和计算效率至关重要。我们的框架为理解梯度学习动态提供了更全面的视角。

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

Result: 在合成基准和蛋白质设计任务中表现出优异的样本效率和有效的偏好融合能力。

Conclusion: A-GPS是一个简单而强大的方法，能够高效生成高质量帕累托集近似，灵活捕捉用户偏好。

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Method: ColMAD协议将多智能体辩论重新定义为非零和游戏，鼓励多个智能体以支持性方式相互批评，相互补充缺失点，使裁判能够基于更全面的证据做出更明智的结论。

Result: 实验表明，ColMAD显著优于之前的竞争性多智能体辩论方法19%，并在错误检测方面比单智能体方法带来非平凡改进。

Conclusion: 协作式多智能体辩论协议ColMAD通过将辩论重新定义为非零和游戏，有效缓解了辩论黑客问题，显著提升了大型语言模型错误检测的性能。

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

Motivation: 标准RL方法优化平均奖励，但减少不良输出概率的方法通常会影响平均性能。需要改进这种权衡关系。

Method: 在标准RL损失基础上增加额外损失，使用学习到的建议来引导采样低奖励输出，然后降低这些输出的概率。

Result: 实验表明RePULSe在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间实现了更好的权衡，并且具有更强的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RePULSe相比标准RL对齐方法和替代方案，能更好地平衡期望奖励和减少不良输出的目标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a

the advantages of the proposed estimator.

Conclusion: 该方法成功将深度学习的表达能力与概率建模的严谨性相结合，为部分标签学习提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 隐式神经表示作为一种强大的知识表示框架，具有分辨率独立性和高内存效率，但其在特定领域应用中的准确性尚未充分了解，特别是在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示方面。

Method: 研究了多种缓解频谱偏差的策略，包括专用激活函数、固定和可训练位置编码、非线性核的线性组合。评估了INRs在数值模拟的血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖的符号距离函数表示中的性能。

Result: 在胸主动脉的真实时空变化血流场中，INRs实现了约230倍的压缩比，压力最大绝对误差1 mmHg，速度误差5-10 cm/s。在48个胸主动脉解剖中，平均和最大绝对解剖差异分别低于0.5mm和1.6mm。SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE架构表现最佳。

Conclusion: 隐式神经表示在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示中表现出卓越性能，实现了高压缩比和低误差，为医学图像和模拟数据的有效表示提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

TL;DR: 本文首次提出了分析自适应优化器（如Adam和Muon）在浮点量化下的收敛性理论框架，证明了只要尾数长度随迭代次数对数增长，这些算法就能保持接近全精度的收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型的快速发展使得低精度训练成为减少内存、提高效率的必要手段，但现有自适应优化器收敛理论忽略了硬件感知量化，无法解释低精度训练为何有效。

Method: 建立了包含梯度、权重和优化器状态（如动量估计）浮点量化的理论分析框架，在平滑非凸目标函数上推导收敛速率，明确量化不同组件的量化误差对收敛的影响。

Result: 理论分析表明Adam对权重和第二动量量化高度敏感，而Muon需要更弱的误差控制，因此可能更鲁棒。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 该研究缩小了低精度训练方法的实证成功与理论理解之间的差距，为低精度训练提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

TL;DR: L2M3OF是首个用于MOF材料的多模态大语言模型，通过整合晶体结构表示学习和语言理解，在性能预测和知识生成任务上超越了仅基于文本的闭源LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但在科学发现领域突破有限，因为理解复杂物理现象需要超越语言的多模态表示。MOF材料设计尤其困难，其三维原子排列和配位几何规则难以用纯文本表示，且依赖难以编码的人类专业知识。

Method: L2M3OF整合了晶体表示学习与语言理解，处理结构、文本和知识模态。使用预训练的晶体编码器和轻量级投影层将结构信息压缩到token空间，与语言指令高效对齐。构建了结构-属性-知识数据库用于训练和评估。

Result: L2M3OF在性能预测和知识生成任务上超越了GPT-5、Gemini-2.5-Pro和DeepSeek-R1等最先进的闭源LLM，且使用的参数数量更少。

Conclusion: 多模态方法对于多孔材料理解至关重要，L2M3OF为下一代材料发现AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

TL;DR: RAVEN是一个鲁棒的弱到强泛化框架，通过动态学习弱模型的最优组合来解决分布偏移下的监督失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着超人类模型日益复杂，人类可能无法有效监督其行为。现有研究表明弱模型可以监督强模型，但在分布偏移下这种监督会失效。

Method: 提出RAVEN框架，动态学习弱模型的最优组合以及强模型的参数，自动识别可信的监督源。

Result: 在图像分类、文本分类和偏好对齐任务上，RAVEN在分布外任务上比基线方法提升超过30%，在分布内任务上表现相当或更好。

Conclusion: RAVEN能够有效解决分布偏移下的弱到强泛化问题，并自动识别更准确的弱模型作为监督源。

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端神经网络训练面临严重的内存限制，这限制了预训练模型在下游任务上的适应能力。

Method: 提出LaRa（层排序）改进的层重要性度量方法，以及利用通道重要性分布时间稳定性的动态通道采样策略，在训练过程中根据重要性加权概率动态重采样通道。

Result: 在大量任务和架构上的广泛评估表明，MeDyate在极端内存约束下实现了最先进的性能，一致优于现有的静态和动态方法，同时保持高计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了向高效设备端学习迈出的重要一步，展示了在低至几百kB RAM的内存预算下进行有效微调的能力。

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理需要大量计算资源和内存，标准均匀量化在低比特场景下会导致显著性能下降，需要更有效的量化方法。

Method: 使用分组格点向量量化，为每组权重分配可学习生成矩阵定义的格点码本，采用Babai舍入近似最近格点搜索解决量化过程不可微问题，训练后解码简化为矩阵向量乘法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，相比现有后训练量化基线，该方法在模型大小和精度之间实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: GLVQ框架在严格资源约束下部署大型模型方面具有有效性，提供了高效实用的量化流程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based

underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

TL;DR: 本文建立了在流行度调整块模型(PABM)下图聚类的理论极限，证明了即使传统边密度信号消失，只要簇内和簇间流行度系数不同，聚类恢复仍然可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型(SBM和DCBM)的局限性，SBM假设顶点度均匀，DCBM在簇间应用统一的度校正，而PABM为簇内和簇间连接引入独立的流行度参数。

Method: 在PABM框架下分析聚类的最优错误率，使用包含k²个特征向量的谱嵌入方法，而不是传统的top k特征向量。

Result: 证明了PABM中聚类恢复的可能性不依赖于全局边密度，而取决于簇内和簇间流行度系数的差异。数值实验显示使用k²个特征向量的谱聚类算法优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PABM捕捉到了DCBM忽略的度异质性维度：局部连接模式的差异可以独立于全局边密度增强簇可分性，且需要更丰富的谱嵌入来捕获模型结构。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

TL;DR: DD2提出了一种新的条件分数蒸馏方法，使图像自回归模型能够实现一步采样，相比DD1减少了67%的性能差距，同时训练速度提升12.3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像自回归模型虽然性能优秀，但采样步骤多导致生成速度慢。DD1虽然实现了少步采样，但在一步采样时性能下降明显，且依赖预定义映射限制了灵活性。

Method: 将原始AR模型视为教师模型，提供潜在嵌入空间中每个token位置的条件分数真值。提出条件分数蒸馏损失来训练一步生成器，训练独立网络预测生成分布的条件分数，并在每个token位置应用分数蒸馏。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上，DD2将一步采样的FID从3.40增加到5.43，相比DD1基线将一步采样与原始AR模型的差距减少了67%，同时训练速度提升达12.3倍。

Conclusion: DD2在实现一步自回归生成方面迈出了重要一步，为快速高质量的自回归建模开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

*Tobias Schmidt,Steffen Schneider,Matthias Bethge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Equivariance by Contrast (EbC)方法，从观察对(y, g·y)中学习等变嵌入，其中g来自作用在数据上的有限群。该方法联合学习潜在空间和群表示，无需依赖群特定的归纳偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种通用方法，仅从群作用观察中学习等变嵌入，无需群特定的归纳偏差，支持包括非阿贝尔群在内的各种群类型。

Method: 通过对比学习联合学习潜在空间和群表示，使群作用对应可逆线性映射。在dSprites数据集上验证，使用有限群G:=(R_m × Z_n × Z_n)结合离散旋转和周期平移。

Result: 生成的嵌入表现出高保真等变性，群操作在潜在空间中忠实再现。在合成数据上成功验证了非阿贝尔正交群O(n)和一般线性群GL(n)。

Conclusion: 这是首个仅从群作用观察中成功实现通用编码器等变学习的演示，包括非平凡非阿贝尔群和受计算机视觉中仿射等变性建模启发的积群。

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了零阶优化在持续学习中的应用，发现它能通过产生更平坦的损失景观来减少遗忘，但会牺牲可塑性。作者提出了ZO-FC方法，结合零阶优化的稳定性和一阶优化的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索零阶优化作为解决持续学习中可塑性-稳定性-效率三难问题的新方法，特别是在梯度计算昂贵或不切实际的场景下。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究评估零阶优化在持续学习中的应用，并提出ZO-FC方法：对单个基于适配器的PEFT模块应用零阶优化，同时用一阶优化更新分类器。

Result: 零阶优化能增强稳定性但会削弱可塑性，特别是在可学习分类器的情况下。ZO-FC方法在稳定性和可塑性之间实现了有效平衡，为设备端持续学习提供了实用的内存高效解决方案。

Conclusion: 零阶优化是持续学习中有前景的方法，ZO-FC设计通过结合零阶优化的稳定性和一阶优化的适应性，为设备端持续学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法往往忽略物理定律且无法量化时空预测中的固有不确定性，这限制了长期预测的准确性和可靠性。

Method: PCNO通过物理一致性投影层在傅里叶空间中强制执行质量和动量守恒；DiffPCNO在确定性预测基础上利用一致性模型来量化和减轻不确定性。

Result: PCNO和DiffPCNO在从湍流建模到真实世界洪水/大气预测的多种系统和空间分辨率下，实现了高保真度的时空预测，同时保持物理一致性和不确定性。

Conclusion: 该两阶段框架为准确、物理基础扎实且不确定性感知的时空预测提供了稳健且通用的方法。

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available
at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/DictPFL.

Method: 在全局层面构建包含基序-分子-属性的三元异构图，捕捉长程组合模式；在局部层面为每个分子-属性对构建子图并分别编码，使模型关注最相关的邻居分子和基序。

Result: 在五个标准FSMPP基准测试中，该框架始终优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 整合全局基序知识与细粒度局部上下文能有效提升少样本分子性质预测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESCORT是一个基于粒子的框架，用于在高维信念空间中捕捉复杂的多模态分布，通过相关感知投影和时间一致性约束改进SVGD方法，在信念近似精度和决策质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准POMDP信念近似方法无法准确表示复杂的不确定性结构（如高维多模态信念分布），导致估计错误和次优的智能体行为。

Method: 扩展SVGD方法，引入相关感知投影来建模状态维度间的依赖关系，以及时间一致性约束来稳定更新并保持相关结构。

Result: 在POMDP领域和合成多模态分布上的广泛评估表明，ESCORT在信念近似精度和下游决策质量方面持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT能够动态适应信念景观的复杂性，无需重采样或限制性分布假设，为复杂POMDP环境提供了有效的信念表示解决方案。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种特征选择方法，通过连续松弛和噪声机制优化贝叶斯最优预测器的方差，实现在多个子群体上同时获得良好性能的模型，且无需反向传播训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特征收集成本高昂的场景中（如添加调查问题或物理传感器），需要选择有限特征来训练能同时在多个子群体上表现良好的模型。

Method: 使用连续松弛传统变量选择方法，通过噪声机制优化贝叶斯最优预测器的方差，开发模型无关的框架来平衡跨群体下游预测性能。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界数据上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效选择特征，使模型在多个子群体上同时获得良好性能，适用于特征收集成本高昂的应用场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolarBoost是一种用于分布式光伏系统功率输出预测的新方法，通过将聚合功率输出建模为小电网输出的组合，解决了DPV系统面临的电网级数据缺失、容量变化等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集中式光伏方法难以应用于分布式光伏系统，因为DPV系统面临电网级数据缺失、安装容量时间变化、地理变异性和面板多样性等挑战。

Method: 将聚合功率输出建模为小电网输出的组合，每个电网输出使用单位输出函数乘以其容量来建模，将同质单位输出函数与动态容量解耦以实现准确预测，并提出基于上界近似的高效算法。

Result: 通过理论分析和实验验证了电网级建模的优越性，在中国多个城市部署验证，显著减少了潜在损失。

Conclusion: SolarBoost为电网运行提供了有价值的见解，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

Motivation: 医疗物联网需要严格的端到端延迟保证，而顺序工作流在异构云-雾-边缘基础设施上的调度是一个NP难问题。

Method: 采用两层DDPG调度框架：全局控制器选择计算层（边缘、雾或云），专用局部控制器处理层内节点分配。

Result: 实验结果表明，随着工作流复杂性增加，该框架相比基线方法表现出越来越优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够学习有效的长期策略，对于复杂、大规模的医疗物联网调度场景至关重要。

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在生成高质量3D分子结构方面表现出色，但难以有效控制复杂多目标约束，这在药物发现等实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 利用具有预测不确定性估计的代理模型动态塑造奖励函数，在多个扩散模型架构上实现多目标优化平衡。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上全面评估，在分子质量和属性优化方面持续优于基线方法；MD模拟和ADMET分析显示生成候选物具有良好药物样行为和结合稳定性，与已知EGFR抑制剂相当。

Conclusion: RL引导的生成扩散模型在自动化分子设计方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

Conclusion: 该框架为聚类分析提供了统一的数学基础，鲁棒变体能够有效处理异常值，为聚类方法的发展提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

*Antoine Boutet,Lucas Magnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SANI是一种语言模型净化方法，通过重置神经元和微调来移除模型对敏感信息的记忆，无需昂贵的重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在特定任务微调时会记忆敏感数据，存在隐私泄露风险，需要一种高效净化方法。

Method: 采用遗忘学习，包含擦除阶段（重置最后层神经元）和修复阶段（避免记忆敏感信息的微调）。

Result: 仅需少量遗忘训练轮次，模型即可被净化，信息泄露数量大幅减少。

Conclusion: SANI为医院等行业提供了一种高效模型净化方案，可在共享前移除敏感信息记忆。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

Conclusion: 为合同设计提供了新的计算工具，使研究分析上难以处理的模型成为可能。

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

Conclusion: 该框架优于现有的后处理方法，为公平的文本到图像生成提供了简单、可扩展且模型无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Result: 在标准持续学习基准测试中，PLAN始终优于现有方法，为基础模型的持续学习建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: PLAN框架通过主动管理任务子空间分配和干扰最小化策略，在基础模型中实现了高效的持续学习，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于成对铰链损失的新型二阶代理损失函数，用于优化AUC性能，解决了传统方法在非凸、不连续损失和大规模应用中的内存瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUC是分类任务中重要的性能指标，特别是在类别不平衡场景下。但由于成对0/1损失的非凸性和不连续性，以及实例级存储的高内存成本，优化AUC面临显著挑战。

Method: 提出二阶代理损失函数，基于训练数据的一阶和二阶统计量直接替代整个聚合的成对损失，并开发了高效的在线算法。还通过核方法扩展到非线性设置。

Result: 理论分析显示，现有在线AUC优化算法通常达到O(√T)遗憾界，而本方法达到更紧的O(ln T)界。在多个基准数据集上的实验证明了该方法的优越效率和有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的二阶代理损失函数为在线AUC优化提供了一种高效有效的解决方案，显著优于传统方法，特别是在大规模应用中表现突出。

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

Method: 系统研究合成先验的关键特性，基于这些洞察开发了Mitra模型，该模型在精心挑选的多样化、独特且在实际数据上表现良好的合成先验混合上进行预训练。

Conclusion: 合成先验分布的设计对TFMs性能至关重要，Mitra通过优化的先验混合实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

TL;DR: ADaMoRE是一个自适应残差专家混合框架，通过无监督训练解决图神经网络在多样化图结构中的适应性问题，结合重构任务和信息论正则化实现专家功能专业化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络面临适应性挑战，固定消息传递架构难以应对现实世界图的多样性，现有图MoE方法依赖监督信号且训练不稳定。

Method: 采用骨干-残差专家架构，基础编码器提供稳定性，专用残差专家捕获多样化计算模式，结构感知门控网络进行细粒度节点路由，使用统一无监督目标端到端训练。

Result: 在16个基准测试中验证了ADaMoRE在无监督节点分类和少样本学习中的最先进性能，具有优越的泛化能力、训练效率和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: ADaMoRE框架通过无监督训练实现了图神经网络的稳健适应性，解决了专家训练不稳定问题，在多样化图和任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将物理约束嵌入流匹配生成模型的框架，通过将流步骤映射到已知物理分布（如2D Ising模型）来增强生成过程的可解释性。

Method: 使用2D Ising模型约束每个流步骤为已知物理分布的采样点，构建包含编码器、流匹配网络和投影器的架构，将离散Ising配置映射到连续潜在空间并进行温度驱动的扩散。

Result: 在多种晶格尺寸上验证了该框架，在保持物理保真度的同时，随着晶格尺寸增大，生成速度优于蒙特卡洛方法。每个向量场代表2D Ising模型潜在空间中有意义的逐步转变。

Conclusion: 将物理语义嵌入生成流可以将不透明的神经轨迹转化为可解释的物理过程，为生成模型提供了物理意义和可解释性。

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Result: 综合实验证明FDAs在模型融合中的有效性，且与参数空间模型融合方法互补。

Conclusion: FDAs框架为模型融合提供了新的视角，连接了联合多任务训练和后融合方法，兼具鲁棒性和灵活性。

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Result: 实证研究表明，可实现的混淆程度与近似模型中的不确定性相关。

Conclusion: 该方法可为深度基于模型的强化学习提供理论基础的探索策略指导。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling
across various scientific and industrial applications. Owing to their
versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade,
aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

TL;DR: Wideformer是一种即插即用的图注意力方法，通过并行处理机制缓解过聚合问题，提升图学习性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图注意力在处理全局交互时面临过聚合问题，大量消息聚合到单个节点会导致关键信息被稀释和信息丢失

Method: 将节点聚合划分为并行过程，引导模型关注特定子集，限制每次聚合的输入量，并对聚合输出进行排序和加权

Conclusion: Wideformer通过并行聚合和注意力引导机制成功解决了图注意力中的过聚合问题，为图学习任务提供了有效的改进方案

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于Buffer层的新型测试时适应范式，解决传统基于归一化层更新的TTA方法在批处理大小敏感性和预训练模型结构限制方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法主要依赖归一化层更新，但存在两个关键问题：1）批归一化层对小批量大小高度敏感，导致统计不稳定；2）基于归一化的适应受限于预训练模型结构，无法很好地泛化到未见域。这些问题限制了归一化基TTA方法在显著域偏移下的有效性。

Method: 引入Buffer层概念的新范式，不修改模型核心参数，保持预训练主干网络的完整性，从而在在线适应过程中减轻灾难性遗忘风险。Buffer层是模块化的，可无缝集成到几乎所有现有TTA框架中。

Result: 通过全面实验证明，该方法在缓解域偏移和增强模型鲁棒性方面优于传统方法，同时表现出强大的抗遗忘能力。在各种架构上都能带来一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的基于Buffer层的解决方案在真实世界域适应场景中具有有效性和通用性，为TTA领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决在真实世界噪声条件下人类活动识别的鲁棒性问题，特别是在WEAR数据集挑战中面临传感器噪声的挑战。

Method: 使用PatchTST变换器架构，为四个惯性传感器位置分别训练独立模型，通过随机抖动、缩放、旋转和通道丢失等数据增强技术模拟测试时噪声，最后通过软概率平均进行模型集成。

Result: 在私有排行榜上获得了显著高于基线的宏F1分数，证明了该方法在噪声条件下的有效性。

Conclusion: 测试匹配的数据增强与基于变换器的模型集成相结合，是在噪声条件下实现鲁棒人类活动识别的有效策略。

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

TL;DR: 提出DVC方法，通过分层数据评估和自适应源选择，在预算约束下为MLP训练选择最有价值的数据样本，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法存在关键限制：过度简化非线性变换、忽略隐藏层中间表示、计算复杂度高难以扩展到大型MLP。需要一种能够考虑网络参数动态演化的预算感知数据选择方法。

Method: 提出DVC方法，将数据贡献分解为层价值贡献(LVC)和全局价值贡献(GVC)，使用6个精心设计的指标从质量、相关性和分布多样性三个维度捕获数据特征，结合UCB算法进行自适应源选择。

Result: 在6个数据集和8个基线方法上的广泛实验表明，DVC在各种预算约束下始终优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: DVC是首个系统处理神经网络分层数据评估的方法，为大规模机器学习系统提供了理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

Motivation: 挑战GAMs作为可解释模型能够高效生成解释的假设，系统分析GAMs在不同情境下解释生成的计算复杂性。

Method: 基于标准复杂性假设(P!=NP)，分析不同形式GAMs在不同上下文中的解释生成复杂性，包括输入空间结构、组件模型类型、任务类型等因素的影响。

Result: 发现GAMs解释复杂性高度依赖输入空间结构；组件模型差异仅在特定输入域下显现；回归与分类任务的解释复杂性存在显著区别；神经网络加性表达在某些条件下更易解释。

Conclusion: 为GAMs解释生成的计算可行性提供了严格的理论框架，揭示了在何种条件下这些计算是可能或证明困难的。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

Conclusion: EPHAD在不同异常检测模型和证据对中展现出多功能性和鲁棒性，为解决训练数据污染问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

Conclusion: 数据在模型多重性中扮演关键角色，提出的多重性感知方法在主动学习和数据填补中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

Conclusion: 相比现有需要专门算法设计和强假设的方法，本文提出的简单方法在更弱假设下实现了更好的性能，解决了多臂老虎机中的公平性问题。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCMC方法收敛慢、存在临界减速和模式混合问题，而基于似然和对抗学习的方法需要大量数据且易出现模式覆盖和模式崩溃

Method: 基于归一化流架构的得分学习框架，集成独立Metropolis-Hastings模块，可在小训练集下保持高性能

Result: 在合成2D分布和高维φ⁴晶格场理论分布上验证了方法的有效性，减少了计算昂贵的MCMC训练数据依赖

Conclusion: ScoreNF为从未归一化目标分布采样提供了一种高效无偏的方法，特别适用于小训练集场景

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究通过用户实验评估了透明AI辅助在睡眠医学中的效果，发现透明AI作为质量控制步骤能显著提升性能，虽然耗时较长但更受临床医生欢迎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在生物医学信号解读中已达到或超越人类专家水平，但临床实践中需要解决何时以及为何信任算法推荐的问题，以促进AI在临床工作流程中的有效整合。

Method: 对8名专业睡眠医学从业者进行应用导向的用户研究，在三种条件下评分夜间觉醒事件：手动评分、黑盒AI辅助和透明白盒AI辅助，辅助时机分为起始辅助和质量控制后辅助。

Result: AI和人类-AI团队均显著优于未辅助专家，透明AI作为质量控制步骤比黑盒AI提升约30%的事件级性能，质量控制时机进一步改善计数结果。透明辅助虽耗时更长，但起始辅助更快且更受参与者青睐。

Conclusion: 策略性定时的透明AI辅助能有效平衡准确性和临床效率，为临床工作流程中可信AI整合和用户接受提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTD受限于训练轨迹长度，规划过程局限于局部，缺乏全局上下文。需要从单轨迹优化扩展到完整计划组合的推理。

Method: 提出C-MCTD框架，包含三个组件：在线组合器进行全局感知规划，分布式组合器通过并行搜索降低复杂度，预规划组合器利用缓存图加速推理。

Result: C-MCTD能够进行全局规划，在长轨迹任务中表现更优，同时通过并行化和缓存机制提高了搜索效率。

Conclusion: C-MCTD成功将规划从单轨迹优化提升到计划组合推理，解决了MCTD的局限性，为长轨迹规划提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

Motivation: 关联学习是人类认知的基础，但研究生物系统中的表征变化具有挑战性。大语言模型提供了可扩展的替代方案来测试这些假说。

Method: 基于大语言模型的上下文学习能力，改编认知神经科学中的关联学习范式，研究六个模型中表征如何演化。

Result: 发现非单调模式与NMPH一致，中等相似项目在学习后出现分化。词汇干扰（新关联与先验知识的竞争）会增强这种分化。

Conclusion: 大语言模型不仅是研究类人学习系统中表征动态的强大工具，也是生成关于大脑记忆重组原理新假说的通用计算模型。

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于在线任务无关类增量学习(OTCIL)的随机神经网络框架，通过前向正则化和贝叶斯学习来解决非独立同分布数据流和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类增量学习在实际应用中面临两个主要问题：(1)非独立同分布的批量数据流且没有边界提示的在线任务无关场景；(2)在长任务流学习中存在记忆损失。需要开发能够高效决策并减少累积遗憾的方法。

Method: 提出了带前向正则化的随机神经网络框架，将无监督知识整合到递归凸优化中。具体开发了可调节前向正则化的集成深度随机向量函数链接网络(edRVFL-kF)，以及基于贝叶斯学习的自适应性版本edRVFL-kF-Bayes。

Result: 实验在2个图像数据集上进行，包含6个指标、动态性能、消融测试和兼容性验证。结果表明，提出的OTCIL框架在避免过去重放和灾难性遗忘的同时，实现了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的edRVFL-kF和edRVFL-kF-Bayes框架有效解决了OTCIL中的挑战，通过一次通过闭式增量更新和可变学习率，显著提升了在线任务无关类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效管理HPO过程中的成本与性能权衡，自动在效用最大时停止优化过程，显著提升了效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解耦表示学习方法依赖特定因子策略，当新变化因子不符合先验假设或多个因子共存时，需要重新设计架构或目标，带来显著开销。

Method: 提出组合偏置作为模块化归纳偏置，通过因子特定的混合策略随机重混潜在变量，使用先验损失和组合一致性损失迫使编码器发现因子结构。

Result: 在属性和对象解耦方面表现出竞争力，并独特地实现了全局风格和对象的联合解耦。

Conclusion: 该方法通过调整混合策略即可实现不同因子的解耦，提供了一种灵活通用的解耦表示学习框架。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

Motivation: 当前合成数据生成方法往往只能复制简单的汇总统计量，但无法保留定义真实世界系统中复杂多变量交互的成对和高阶相关结构，导致合成数据在复杂建模任务中失效。

Method: 使用Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵来生成合成数据，该方法通过数学证明能够完整保留源数据集的整个相关结构。

Result: 该方法能够生成保留完整相关结构（从简单的成对关系到高阶交互）的合成数据，具有计算高效的特点。

Conclusion: GCM方法为合成数据生成提供了新途径，在隐私保护数据共享、鲁棒模型训练和仿真方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于扩散的方法需要训练模型来学习反向噪声过程，而self-diffusion旨在开发一个自包含的迭代过程，不依赖预训练模型，具有更高的灵活性和适应性。

Method: 在self-diffusion的每个步骤中，向当前估计添加噪声，然后通过数据保真度损失连续训练一个随机初始化的自去噪器（单层未训练卷积网络）来从噪声估计中预测解。

Result: 在线性逆问题的各种实验中，self-diffusion表现出与其他方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: self-diffusion通过利用神经网络的频谱偏置和调度噪声过程，提供了一种无需预训练分数函数或外部去噪器的灵活且广泛适用的逆问题解决方法。

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

Motivation: 在安全关键环境中部署强化学习受到分布偏移脆弱性的限制，需要研究RL时间序列的OOD检测方法。

Method: DEEDEE使用两个统计量：episodewise均值和RBF核相似度，捕捉全局和局部偏差，是一种极简的替代方案。

Result: DEEDEE在标准RL OOD测试套件中匹配或超越当代检测器，计算量减少600倍，准确率平均提高5%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，多样异常类型通常通过少量低阶统计量在RL轨迹中留下印记，为复杂环境中的OOD检测提供了紧凑基础。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在解决Stefan问题时存在超参数依赖性强、训练效率低和预测精度不足的问题，需要开发更高效准确的方法。

Method: 使用极限学习机网络替代传统深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过最小二乘法优化由初始边界条件和控制偏微分方程组成的物理定律损失向量来确定输出权重，将逆Stefan问题转化为寻找Moore-Penrose广义逆的问题。

Conclusion: PIELM框架为逆Stefan问题提供了一种快速、高效的物理信息学习方法，显著提升了计算效率和预测精度。

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

<details>

Motivation: 大规模网络系统（如交通、电力、无线网络）在规模和环境变化方面对强化学习代理构成挑战，需要同时解决可扩展性和领域泛化问题。

Method: 每个代理首先学习稀疏局部因果掩码，识别影响其动态的最小邻域变量，生成紧凑的状态和领域因子表示。然后元actor-critic在多个源域上训练共享策略，并在测试时通过少量轨迹估计新领域因子来部署适应策略。

Result: GSAC能够快速适应新领域，显著优于从头学习和传统适应基线方法，并建立了因果恢复、actor-critic收敛和适应差距的有限样本保证。

Conclusion: GSAC框架通过因果表示学习和元学习相结合，成功解决了大规模网络系统中的可扩展性和领域泛化挑战，具有理论保证和实际性能优势。

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Decision Transformer存在冗余令牌化和二次注意力复杂度问题，限制了在实时或资源受限环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 开发统一令牌表示(UTR)，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单个令牌，并基于此构建UDT(Transformer架构)和UDC(门控CNN架构)两个变体。

Result: 两种变体在显著降低计算量的同时，达到或超越了最先进方法的性能，理论分析显示UTR具有更紧的Rademacher复杂度界限。

Conclusion: UTR方法在不同架构上泛化良好，为未来大规模决策模型的可扩展控制提供了高效基础。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN的序列性质限制了并行计算能力，而现有的并行化架构如Transformer和状态空间模型(SSMs)在线性约束下表达能力受限，无法建模复杂的非线性序列依赖关系。

Method: 将非线性递归关系序列转化为单一方程组，使用牛顿迭代结合自定义并行归约进行并行求解，实现了对LSTM和GRU架构的并行化训练。

Result: 相比朴素顺序应用实现了高达665倍的加速，成功训练了7B参数的非线性RNN模型，困惑度与同等规模的Transformer和Mamba2架构相当。

Conclusion: ParaRNN框架突破了非线性RNN的并行化障碍，为高效序列建模研究提供了开源工具，使研究人员能够在更大规模上探索非线性RNN模型。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将个性化解释作为推荐本身来学习，通过预测用户会为物品拍摄什么照片来生成有说服力的解释，从而提高推荐系统的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释复杂系统（如推荐系统）的输出对用户和公司都至关重要。用户上传的照片可以强化或证明他们对物品的评价，因此预测用户会拍摄的照片可以作为最佳的说服论据。

Method: 提出一个形式化框架来估计给定（用户，照片）对的所有权概率。使用TripAdvisor收集的餐厅评论（包含照片）数据来验证方法。

Result: 通过预测用户会拍摄的照片，推荐系统可以解释其推荐结果并提高可靠性。同时，公司可以获得关于客户关注产品哪些方面的生动知识。

Conclusion: 将个性化解释作为推荐本身学习是可行的，这种方法不仅能提高推荐系统的可靠性，还能为公司提供有价值的客户洞察。

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出HINet方法，结合图神经网络和领域对抗训练，用于估计网络环境中的异质处理效应，解决未知暴露映射和网络级协变量偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果机器学习方法通常假设已知暴露映射，这在现实中往往不切实际；同时同质性倾向与处理分配机制的交互会导致网络级协变量偏移，影响处理效应估计准确性。

Method: HINet方法整合图神经网络与领域对抗训练，能够在未知暴露映射情况下估计处理效应，并减轻网络级协变量偏移的影响。

Result: 在合成和半合成网络数据集上的广泛实证评估证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HINet提供了一种有效的方法来处理网络环境中的异质处理效应估计问题，特别是在面对未知暴露映射和网络级协变量偏移时。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的超图神经网络（HNNs）虽然能有效编码高阶结构，但由于复杂的黑盒架构，常常面临过拟合和可扩展性问题。

Method: 基于线性化HNNs的统一公式，ZEN引入了权重矩阵的可追踪闭式解和冗余感知传播方案，避免迭代训练并消除冗余自信息。

Result: 在11个真实世界超图基准上，ZEN在分类准确率上持续优于8个基线模型，同时实现高达696倍的加速。

Conclusion: ZEN不仅实现了表达能力和效率的平衡，其决策过程完全可解释，为数据集特征提供了洞察。

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了Vapnik和Chervonenkis的均匀收敛框架，引入了Uniform Mean Estimability（UME-learnability）概念，研究分布集合在任意估计器下是否允许均匀均值估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工作关注经验均值估计器的均匀收敛，本文旨在超越这一限制，研究更一般的均匀均值可估计性条件。

Method: 在分布集合的均值向量空间上工作，分析均值向量的可分性条件，并构造非可分但UME可学习的分布集合反例。

Result: 证明了均值向量的可分性是UME可学习的充分条件，但不是必要条件；解决了Cohen等人关于UME可学习集合可数并的猜想。

Conclusion: 建立了均匀均值可估计性的新理论框架，揭示了可分性条件与均匀学习能力之间的复杂关系。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一模型(UM)解决无人机灾后道路评估路由问题，通过单一神经网络处理8种问题变体，显著减少训练时间和参数，在解决方案质量上优于单任务深度强化学习和传统优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后道路评估对应急响应至关重要，但现有方法存在扩展性差、需要领域专业知识、缺乏适应性等问题，无法满足动态灾害场景的需求。

Method: 使用现代transformer编码器-解码器架构训练单一神经网络，通过轻量级适配器机制实现高效微调，无需重新训练即可适应未见属性。

Result: UM将训练时间和参数减少8倍，解决方案质量比单任务深度强化学习方法提高6-14%，比传统优化方法提高24-82%，在1000节点网络中实现1-10秒实时求解。

Conclusion: UM为时间关键型应用推进了神经组合优化，为基于无人机的灾后道路评估提供了计算高效、高质量且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

*Jan Wehner,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在训练中使用探针检测器时如何避免Goodhart定律问题，发现基于探针的偏好优化比基于分类器的方法能更好地保持探针检测能力，且探针多样性益处有限，重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探针可用于检测模型内部的不良行为（如欺骗或偏见），但将其作为训练目标时可能因Goodhart定律而失效，需要研究如何在使用探针训练的同时保持其检测可靠性。

Method: 提出了基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的两种训练方法，在毒性检测测试平台上进行实验，评估了使用探针集成、保留未训练探针和训练后重新训练探针三种策略。

Result: 基于探针的偏好优化意外地比基于分类器的方法更好地保持了探针可检测性；探针多样性提供的实际益处很小，只需在优化后重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。

Conclusion: 基于探针的训练在某些对齐方法中可行，当重新训练可行时，探针集成基本没有必要。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为时空区域扭曲（SRD）的伪异常生成方法，通过增强弱监督视频异常检测模型的对抗鲁棒性，解决了现有模型易受对抗攻击的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督视频异常检测模型由于只有视频级标签而缺乏帧级监督，传统对抗训练方法效果不佳，且伪标签噪声严重影响性能。

Method: 使用时空区域扭曲方法在正常视频的局部区域施加严重增强来生成合成异常，同时保持时间一致性，结合噪声伪标签进行对抗训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，整体AUROC性能平均比最先进方法高出71.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的SRD方法通过生成精确标注的合成异常，有效减少了标签噪声，使对抗训练在弱监督视频异常检测中变得可行且有效。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

TL;DR: 提出了修订相似性问题，发现现有度量方法（如BLEU）因共享内容主导而失效，提出新的静态度量方法Excision Score（ES），通过移除共享内容后比较差异区域，在代码编辑评估中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档修订评估方法（如BLEU）存在根本缺陷，其得分被共享内容主导，无法准确反映人类对修订差异的判断，需要新的度量方法。

Method: 提出Excision Score（ES）方法，使用最长公共子序列（LCS）移除现有文档与修订版本间的共享内容，然后仅比较剩余的不同区域，并通过近似方法将标准立方LCS计算加速到二次。

Result: 在HumanEvalFix代码编辑评估中，ES比最接近的竞争对手SARI提高12%的皮尔逊相关性，比标准方法如BLEU提高>21%；当增加共享上下文时，ES对SARI的改进增加到20%，对标准方法的改进>30%。

Conclusion: ES是一种有效的修订相似性度量方法，能够正确处理共享内容问题，在代码编辑评估中表现优异，并能处理其他度量方法无法处理的特殊情况。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

Conclusion: MADDPG-COCG算法能有效解决SAGIN-MEC系统中的复杂优化问题，为低空经济应用提供高效的计算服务解决方案。

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

Conclusion: 将ECG分析与结构化临床知识对齐有助于构建更透明、可泛化和可信赖的AI诊断系统。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Conclusion: 将经典算法先验嵌入GNNs可以提供有用的归纳偏置，提升在复杂真实世界图数据上的性能。

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

Result: 在10个下游EEG任务中达到最先进性能，包括运动想象分类、癫痫检测、睡眠分期等，展示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: REVE推动了标准化EEG研究，为临床神经科学进展提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

*Lei Liu,Zhenxin Huang,Hong Wang,huanshuo dong,Haiyang Xin,Hongwei Zhao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出HOPSS算法，通过同源扰动方法在解空间中直接生成训练数据集，显著减少数据生成所需的时间步数，降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动深度学习方法需要大量解对数据，这些数据通常通过传统数值方法生成，需要数千个时间步迭代，计算和时耗巨大。

Method: 首先从可靠求解器获取基础解函数并降采样对齐时间步，然后采用同源扰动方法：将两个解函数结合（一个作为主函数，另一个作为同源扰动项）加上随机噪声，高效生成精度相当的PDE数据点，最后计算原方程右端项变化形成新解对。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明HOPSS降低了时间复杂度。在Navier-Stokes方程上，生成10,000个样本仅需传统方法约10%的时间，且模型训练性能相当。

Conclusion: HOPSS算法能够显著加速PDE训练数据集的生成，同时保持模型训练所需的近似精度，为数据驱动深度学习方法提供了高效的数据生成方案。

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个计算张量网络SHAP解释的通用框架，证明了在张量链结构下SHAP计算可在多对数时间内完成，并揭示了神经网络宽度而非深度是SHAP计算的主要计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP解释对于简单模型可在多项式时间内计算，但对于神经网络等更复杂的黑盒模型则变为NP难问题，而这类模型恰恰最需要解释性。

Method: 提出了计算张量网络SHAP解释的通用框架，特别关注张量链结构，利用并行计算实现高效计算，并将结果推广到决策树、线性模型等其他流行ML模型。

Result: 在张量链结构下，SHAP计算可在多对数时间内完成；对于二值化神经网络，当网络宽度固定时SHAP计算变得高效可处理，而即使深度固定计算仍然困难。

Conclusion: 宽度而非深度是SHAP计算的主要计算瓶颈，这一发现为理解复杂模型解释性计算复杂度提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前几何生成模型在推理时计算成本高昂，需要许多复杂的数值模拟步骤，因为它们基于黎曼流形上的扩散和流匹配等动态测度传输框架。

Method: 提出了广义流映射(GFM)框架，并实例化了三种基于自蒸馏的训练方法：广义拉格朗日流映射、广义欧拉流映射和广义渐进流映射。

Result: 在几何数据集（包括地理空间数据、RNA扭转角和双曲流形）上的基准测试表明，GFM在单步和少步评估中实现了最先进的样本质量，并使用隐式概率流获得了优越或具有竞争力的对数似然。

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀疏场景（如机器人操作、分子物理、星系形态分类）中，等变网络能改善对输入空间欠采样部分的建模，不确定性估计能防止过度自信。但等变性与模型置信度、模型校准之间的关系尚未被研究。

Method: 通过证明各种等变条件下不确定性校准误差（ECE和ENCE）的上下界，建立了等变性与不确定性估计的理论关系，并辅以数值实验验证，分析了对称性不匹配、群大小、偶然性和认知性不确定性的影响。

Result: 理论分析阐明了等变模型的泛化界限，揭示了对称性不匹配会导致分类和回归任务中的校准错误。数值实验进一步澄清了等变性与不确定性之间的关系。

Conclusion: 本文首次建立了等变性与模型校准的理论联系，为理解等变模型在不确定性估计方面的表现提供了理论框架，对数据稀疏场景下的深度学习应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Conclusion: 这首次提供了神经旅行商问题求解器在节点选择前计算内容的模型内部解释，证明了几何结构无需显式监督即可出现，并为结合神经效率和算法可解释性的透明混合系统指明了途径。

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

Abstract: High-dimensional data that exhibit an intrinsic low-dimensional structure are
ubiquitous in machine learning and data science. While various approaches allow
for learning the corresponding data manifold from finite samples, performing
downstream tasks such as optimization directly on these learned manifolds
presents a significant challenge. This work introduces a principled framework
for optimization on learned data manifolds using iso-Riemannian geometry. Our
approach addresses key limitations of classical Riemannian optimization in this
setting, specifically, that the Levi-Civita connection fails to yield
constant-speed geodesics, and that geodesic convexity assumptions break down
under the learned pullback constructions commonly used in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose new notions of monotonicity and Lipschitz
continuity tailored to the iso-Riemannian setting and propose iso-Riemannian
descent algorithms for which we provide a detailed convergence analysis. We
demonstrate the practical effectiveness of those algorithms on both synthetic
and real datasets, including MNIST under a learned pullback structure. Our
approach yields interpretable barycentres, improved clustering, and provably
efficient solutions to inverse problems, even in high-dimensional settings.
These results establish that optimization under iso-Riemannian geometry can
overcome distortions inherent to learned manifold mappings.

Abstract: Distributed energy resources offer a control-based option to improve
distribution system reliability by ensuring system states that positively
impact component failure rates. This option is an attractive complement to
otherwise costly and lengthy physical infrastructure upgrades. However,
required models that adequately map operational decisions and environmental
conditions to system failure risk are lacking because of data unavailability
and the fact that distribution system failures remain rare events. This paper
addresses this gap and proposes a multi-source data model that consistently
maps comprehensive weather and system state information to component failure
rates. To manage collinearity in the available features, we propose two
ensemble tree-based models that systematically identify the most influential
features and reduce the dataset's dimensionality based on each feature's impact
on failure rate estimates. These estimates are embedded within a sequential,
non-convex optimization procedure, that dynamically updates operational control
decisions. We perform a numerical experiment to demonstrate the cost and
reliability benefits that can be achieved through this reliability-aware
control approach and to analyze the properties of each proposed estimation
model.

Conclusion: 仅限制上层问题的变量或约束数量不足以使双层线性规划变得易解，但局部最优解可以在多项式时间内找到，这为实际应用提供了可能性。

Abstract: Bilevel linear programming (LP) is one of the simplest classes of bilevel
optimization problems, yet it is known to be NP-hard in general. Specifically,
determining whether the optimal objective value of a bilevel LP is at least as
good as a given threshold, a standard decision version of the problem, is
NP-complete. However, this decision problem becomes tractable when either the
number of lower-level variables or the number of lower-level constraints is
fixed, which prompts the question: What if restrictions are placed on the
upper-level problem? In this paper, we address this gap by showing that the
decision version of bilevel LP remains NP-complete even when there is only a
single upper-level variable, no upper-level constraints (apart from the
constraint enforcing optimality of the lower-level decision) and all variables
are bounded between 0 and 1. This result implies that fixing the number of
variables or constraints in the upper-level problem alone does not lead to
tractability in general. On the positive side, we show that there is a
polynomial-time algorithm that finds a local optimal solution of such a
rational bilevel LP instance. We also demonstrate that many combinatorial
optimization problems, such as the knapsack problem and the traveling salesman
problem, can be written as such a bilevel LP instance.

Abstract: We study stochastic optimal control problems for (possibly degenerate)
McKean-Vlasov controlled diffusions and obtain discrete-time as well as finite
interacting particle approximations. (i) Under mild assumptions, we first prove
the existence of optimal relaxed controls by endowing the space of relaxed
policies with a compact weak topology. (ii) Establishing continuity of the cost
in control policy, we establish near-optimality of piecewise-constant strict
policies, show that the discrete-time value functions (finite-horizon and
discounted infinite-horizon) converge to their continuous-time counterparts as
the timestep converges to zero, and that optimal discrete-time policies are
near-optimal for the original continuous-time problem, where rates of
convergence are also obtained. (iii) We then extend these approximation and
near-optimality results to $N$-particle interacting systems under centralized
or decentralized mean-field sharing information structure, proving that the
discrete-time McKean-Vlasov policy is asymptotically optimal as $N\to \infty$
and the time step goes to zero. We thus develop an approximation of
McKean-Vlasov optimal control problems via discrete-time McKean-Vlasov control
problems (and associated numerical methods such as finite model approximation),
and also show the near optimality of such approximate policy solutions for the
$N$-agent interacting models under centralized and decentralized control.

Abstract: We study a time-varying Bayesian optimization problem with bandit feedback,
where the reward function belongs to a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).
We approach the problem via an upper-confidence bound Gaussian Process
algorithm, which has been proven to yield no-regret in the stationary case.
  The time-varying case is more challenging and no-regret results are out of
reach in general in the standard setting. As such, we instead tackle the
question of how many additional observations asked to an expert are required to
regain a no-regret property. To do so, we formulate the presence of past
observation via an uncertainty injection procedure, and we reframe the problem
as a heteroscedastic Gaussian Process regression. In addition, to achieve a
no-regret result, we discard long outdated observations and replace them with
updated (possibly very noisy) ones obtained by asking queries to an external
expert. By leveraging and extending sparse inference to the heteroscedastic
case, we are able to secure a no-regret result in a challenging time-varying
setting with only logarithmically-many side queries per time step. Our method
demonstrates that minimal additional information suffices to counteract
temporal drift, ensuring efficient optimization despite time variation.

*Laura Selicato,Flavia Esposito,Andersen Ang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Binno：一种用于非凸、非光滑双层优化的新方法，通过近端构造和精心设计的下降条件实现有效优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非凸、非光滑双层优化问题的挑战，这类问题在机器学习中很常见但难以有效求解

Method: 使用块状近端梯度更新，分别处理上层和下层问题，然后通过校准的块对角凸组合形成迭代，结合线搜索选择组合权重

Result: 在稀疏低秩分解任务中，Binno在合成矩阵和真实交通视频数据集上获得了更低的重构误差和更高的峰值信噪比

Conclusion: Binno方法在非凸非光滑双层优化问题中表现出色，提供了理论保证和实际性能优势

Abstract: In this work, we develop a method for nonconvex, nonsmooth bi-level
optimization and we introduce Binno, a first order method that leverages
proximal constructions together with carefully designed descent conditions and
variational analysis. Within this framework, Binno provably enforces a descent
property for the overall objective surrogate associated with the bi-level
problem. Each iteration performs blockwise proximal-gradient updates for the
upper and the lower problems separately and then forms a calibrated,
block-diagonal convex combination of the two tentative iterates. A linesearch
selects the combination weights to enforce simultaneous descent of both
level-wise objectives, and we establish conditions guaranteeing the existence
of such weights together with descent directions induced by the associated
proximal-gradient maps. We also apply Binno in the context of sparse low-rank
factorization, where the upper level uses elementwise $\ell_1$ penalties and
the lower level uses nuclear norms, coupled via a Frobenius data term. We test
Binno on synthetic matrix and a real traffic-video dataset, attaining lower
relative reconstruction error and higher peak signal-to-noise ratio than some
standard methods.

*Emmanuelle Augeraud-Véron,Daria Ghilli,Fausto Gozzi,Marta Leocata*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个环境资产管理的随机模型，其中各地当局基于自身福利最大化制定政策而不合作。模型考虑了本地和全球环境资产对福利的影响，分析了N人博弈的纳什均衡及其收敛到平均场博弈的过程，并与社会规划者的合作方案进行比较，找到了使分散均衡与社会最优对齐的庇古税。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在非合作地理环境中环境资产管理的策略互动问题，其中地方当局只关注自身福利而不考虑全局影响，这导致了复杂的技术挑战和战略互动。

Method: 首先从N人博弈角度分析，找到显式的开环和闭环纳什均衡；研究N人博弈收敛到平均场博弈的过程；从社会规划者角度求解合作问题；比较分散均衡与社会最优解，并找到对齐两者的庇古税。

Result: 找到了N人博弈的显式开环和闭环纳什均衡；证明了N人博弈收敛到平均场博弈，且其唯一均衡正是前述纳什均衡的极限；明确求解了社会规划者的合作问题；找到了使分散闭环均衡与社会最优对齐的庇古税。

Conclusion: 该模型成功刻画了非合作环境资产管理中的战略互动，证明了平均场博弈作为N人博弈极限的合理性，并通过庇古税机制实现了分散决策与社会最优的协调。

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to formulate and study a stochastic model for the
management of environmental assets in a geographical context where in each
place the local authorities take their policy decisions maximizing their own
welfare, hence not cooperating each other. A key feature of our model is that
the welfare depends not only on the local environmental asset, but also on the
global one, making the problem much more interesting but technically much more
complex to study, since strategic interaction among players arise.
  We study the problem first from the $N$-players game perspective and find
open and closed loop Nash equilibria in explicit form. We also study the
convergence of the $N$-players game (when $n\to +\infty$) to a suitable Mean
Field Game whose unique equilibrium is exactly the limit of both the open and
closed loop Nash equilibria found above, hence supporting their meaning for the
game. Then we solve explicitly the problem from the cooperative perspective of
the social planner and compare its solution to the equilibria of the
$N$-players game. Moreover we find the Pigouvian tax which aligns the
decentralized closed loop equilibrium to the social optimum.

Motivation: 传统控制方法在处理系统不确定性时性能受限，需要一种能够适应不确定性实现的自适应性能基准框架。

Method: 使用离散时间不确定线性时不变系统建模，构建最优非因果控制器作为性能基准，通过线性近似将鲁棒加性遗憾条件转化为μ-综合问题。

Result: 证明了控制器实现鲁棒加性遗憾的充要条件，并通过数值示例验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的鲁棒遗憾控制框架能够有效处理系统不确定性，通过转化为标准μ-综合问题实现了可行的控制器设计。

Abstract: This paper proposes a robust regret control framework in which the
performance baseline adapts to the realization of system uncertainty. The plant
is modeled as a discrete-time, uncertain linear time-invariant system with
real-parametric uncertainty. The performance baseline is the optimal non-causal
controller constructed with full knowledge of the disturbance and the specific
realization of the uncertain plant. We show that a controller achieves robust
additive regret relative to this baseline if and only if it satisfies a
related, robust $H_\infty$ performance condition on a modified plant. One
technical issue is that the modified plant can, in general, have a complicated
nonlinear dependence on the uncertainty. We use a linear approximation step so
that the robust additive regret condition can be recast as a standard
$\mu$-synthesis problem. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the
proposed approach.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的多层神经网络架构，用于图像恢复问题，该架构基于单调Lipschitz梯度去噪器，通过权重绑定和非负权重确保凸性，无需Lipschitz常数约束，在训练时间和去模糊性能上具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于近期关于单调Lipschitz梯度去噪器的研究，建立一个"可解释"的即插即用框架，揭示最小化的目标函数，解决传统PnP方法中Lipschitz常数约束的问题。

Method: 采用权重绑定的非负神经网络架构，从每层相关函数叠加的梯度推导而来，通过限制非负权重确保势函数的凸性和去噪器的单调性。

Result: 提出的PnP算法收敛到包含由去噪器诱导的"隐式"弱凸正则化器的目标函数的最小化器，在训练时间和去模糊性能上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该无Lipschitz约束的去噪器在训练效率和性能上具有优势，为图像恢复问题提供了一种有前景的神经网络优化方法。

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-layer neural network architecture that gives a
promising neural network empowered optimization approach to the image
restoration problem. The proposed architecture is motivated by the recent study
of monotone Lipschitz-gradient (MoL-Grad) denoiser (Yukawa and Yamada, 2025)
which establishes an ``explainable'' plug-and-play (PnP) framework in the sense
of disclosing the objective minimized. The architecture is derived from the
gradient of a superposition of functions associated with each layer, having the
weights in the encoder and decoder tied with each other. Convexity of the
potential, and thus monotonicity of its gradient (denoiser), is ensured by
restricting ourselves to nonnegative weights. Unlike the previous PnP
approaches with theoretical guarantees, the denoiser is free from constraints
on the Lipschitz constant of the denoiser. Our PnP algorithm employing the
weight-tying nonnegative neural network converges to a minimizer of the
objective involving an ``implicit'' weakly convex regularizer induced by the
denoiser. The convergence analysis relies on an efficient technique to preserve
the overall convexity even in the ill-conditioned case where the loss function
is not strongly convex. The simulation study shows the advantages of the
Lipschitz-constraint-free nature of the proposed denoiser in training time as
well as deblurring performance.

Motivation: 解决黎曼流形上非光滑非凸随机优化的有限时间收敛性分析问题，填补该领域理论空白。

Method: 提出RO2NC算法及其零阶版本ZO-RO2NC，将Goldstein稳定性概念扩展到黎曼流形设置。

Result: 建立了O(ε⁻³δ⁻¹)的样本复杂度，这是黎曼流形上完全非光滑非凸优化的首个有限时间保证，且与欧几里得空间最优复杂度匹配。

Conclusion: 理论分析和数值实验均验证了所提算法的有效性和最优性。

Abstract: This work addresses the finite-time analysis of nonsmooth nonconvex
stochastic optimization under Riemannian manifold constraints. We adapt the
notion of Goldstein stationarity to the Riemannian setting as a performance
metric for nonsmooth optimization on manifolds. We then propose a Riemannian
Online to NonConvex (RO2NC) algorithm, for which we establish the sample
complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3}\delta^{-1})$ in finding
$(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points. This result is the first-ever
finite-time guarantee for fully nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization on manifolds
and matches the optimal complexity in the Euclidean setting. When gradient
information is unavailable, we develop a zeroth order version of RO2NC
algorithm (ZO-RO2NC), for which we establish the same sample complexity. The
numerical results support the theory and demonstrate the practical
effectiveness of the algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络系统中的优化算法部署面临时延和损坏的挑战，特别是由包丢失和不规则采样引起的时变延迟会破坏梯度下降算法的稳定性。

Method: 使用切换调度输出反馈控制器实现优化算法，通过约束切换序列来模拟时变延迟的速率变化和锯齿行为，采用二分法搜索收敛率和Zames-Falb滤波器系数。

Result: 开发了具有认证指数收敛率的优化算法，能够抵抗优化器与梯度oracle之间的切换不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理网络系统中的时变延迟问题，为优化算法在不确定网络环境中的部署提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Deployment of optimization algorithms on networked systems face challenges
associated with time delays and corruptions. One particular instance is the
presence of time-varying delays arising from factors such as packet drops and
irregular sampling. Fixed time delays can destabilize gradient descent
algorithms, and this degradation is exacerbated by time-varying delays. This
work concentrates on the analysis and creation of discrete-time optimization
algorithms with certified exponential convergence rates that are robust against
switched uncertainties between the optimizer and the gradient oracle. These
optimization algorithms are implemented by a switch-scheduled output feedback
controllers. Rate variation and sawtooth behavior (packet drops) in
time-varying delays can be imposed through constraining switching sequences.
Analysis is accomplished by bisection in the convergence rate to find
Zames-Falb filter coefficents. Synthesis is performed by alternating between a
filter coefficient search for a fixed controller, and a controller search for
fixed multipliers.

Method: 开发了多级Picard近似方案，使用模拟方法在有限时间范围内处理高维控制问题。

Result: 证明了在适当条件下，该方法能克服维度灾难，计算复杂度在问题维度d和精度1/ε上呈多项式增长。数值实验显示该方法在至少20维情况下计算可行。

Conclusion: 多级Picard近似方法为高维漂移控制问题提供了一种有效的计算方案，具有多项式复杂度的优势。

Abstract: Motivated by applications to the dynamic control of queueing networks, we
develop a simulation-based scheme, the so-called multilevel Picard (MLP)
approximation, for solving high-dimensional drift control problems whose states
are constrained to stay within the nonnegative orthant, over a finite time
horizon. We prove that under suitable conditions, the MLP approximation
overcomes the curse of dimensionality in the following sense: To approximate
the value function and its gradient evaluated at a given time and state to
within a prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$, the computational complexity grows
at most polynomially in the problem dimension $d$ and $1/\varepsilon$. To
illustrate the effectiveness of the scheme, we carry out numerical experiments
for a class of test problems that are related to the dynamic scheduling problem
of parallel server systems in heavy traffic, and demonstrate that the scheme is
computationally feasible up to dimension at least $20$.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于子博弈完美概念的梯度方法ASPGM，用于光滑凸优化，具有动态最优性、无参数、无线性搜索等特点，性能与L-BFGS方法相当但具有更强的理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受近期优化领域进展启发，旨在开发一种具有动态最优性保证的梯度方法，克服传统拟牛顿方法缺乏非渐近理论保证的局限性。

Method: ASPGM算法基于子博弈完美概念，使用动量型更新，动态优化基于有限历史一阶信息，结合自动调节、重启和预条件技术，无需线性搜索和参数调整。

Result: ASPGM在广泛的光滑凸优化问题上与最先进的L-BFGS方法具有竞争力，同时提供子博弈完美的非渐近保证和解决方案质量证书。

Conclusion: ASPGM结合了高性能和强理论保证，为光滑凸优化提供了具有简单停止准则和重启条件的有效方法。

Abstract: We present a performant gradient method for smooth convex optimization,
drawing inspiration from several recent advances in the field. Our algorithm,
the Adaptive Subgame Perfect Gradient Method (ASPGM) is based on the notion of
subgame perfection, attaining a dynamic strengthening of minimax optimality. At
each iteration, ASPGM makes a momentum-type update, optimized dynamically based
on a (limited) memory/bundle of past first-order information. ASPGM is
linesearch-free, parameter-free, and adaptive due to its use of recently
developed auto-conditioning, restarting, and preconditioning ideas. We show
that ASPGM is competitive with state-of-the-art L-BFGS methods on a wide range
of smooth convex problems. Unlike quasi-Newton methods, however, our core
algorithm underlying ASPGM has strong, subgame perfect, non-asymptotic
guarantees, providing certificates of solution quality, resulting in simple
stopping criteria and restarting conditions.

Abstract: We propose a disciplined, numerically stable, and scalable approach to SDP
relaxations of the ACOPF problem based on linear cutting-planes. Our method can
be warm-started and, owing to its linear nature, enables the computation of

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: SLIM是一个用于非线性GMM的可扩展随机近似框架，通过小批量矩条件及其导数进行迭代更新，无需一致初始估计量或全局凸性，支持固定样本和随机抽样渐近性，并包含二阶精化和推断程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统GMM方法在大规模非线性模型中的计算效率问题，特别是在矩条件数量庞大时，传统方法收敛缓慢甚至无法收敛。

Method: 使用独立小批量的矩条件及其导数形成迭代更新，产生无偏方向确保几乎必然收敛。开发了基于随机缩放和插件方法的二阶精化和推断程序，包括插件、去偏插件和在线版本的Sargan-Hansen J检验。

Result: 在基于576个矩条件、380个参数和n=10^5的非线性EASI需求系统的蒙特卡洛实验中，SLIM在1.4小时内求解模型，而完整样本GMM在Stata中需要18小时。去偏插件J检验提供满意的有限样本推断，SLIM可平滑扩展到n=10^6。

Conclusion: SLIM为大规模非线性GMM估计提供了一个高效、可扩展的解决方案，显著优于传统方法，并提供了可靠的推断工具。

Abstract: We propose SLIM (Stochastic Learning and Inference in overidentified Models),
a scalable stochastic approximation framework for nonlinear GMM. SLIM forms
iterative updates from independent mini-batches of moments and their
derivatives, producing unbiased directions that ensure almost-sure convergence.
It requires neither a consistent initial estimator nor global convexity and
accommodates both fixed-sample and random-sampling asymptotics. We further
develop an optional second-order refinement and inference procedures based on
random scaling and plug-in methods, including plug-in, debiased plug-in, and
online versions of the Sargan--Hansen $J$-test tailored to stochastic learning.
In Monte Carlo experiments based on a nonlinear EASI demand system with 576
moment conditions, 380 parameters, and $n = 10^5$, SLIM solves the model in
under 1.4 hours, whereas full-sample GMM in Stata on a powerful laptop
converges only after 18 hours. The debiased plug-in $J$-test delivers
satisfactory finite-sample inference, and SLIM scales smoothly to $n = 10^6$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑人男性面临传统男性气质规范和系统性种族主义的双重障碍，导致心理健康求助率低。虽然名人心理健康披露有望减少污名，但缺乏对其在黑人男性社区中影响的研究。

Method: 采用收敛混合方法分析11,306条YouTube评论，包括VADER情感分类、LDA主题建模、NRC情感词典分析，以及对2,100条高参与度评论进行反思性主题分析。

Result: 发现评论呈现积极情感，社区放大了心理健康讨论。识别出八个主题，其中同伴支持最为突出。支持数字许可结构模型，显示名人交叉身份、嘻哈真实性和数字平台特性共同创造了脆弱性表达机制。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了基于缺陷的黑人男性气质模型，建议干预措施应利用集体主义、与高地位文化人物合作、采用基于优势的信息传递，并以嘻哈真实性为中心而非强加西方个人主义框架。

Abstract: Black men face a double barrier to mental health help-seeking: traditional
masculinity norms demanding emotional restrictiveness and systemic racism
fostering institutional mistrust. While celebrity mental health disclosures
show promise for stigma reduction, limited research examines their impact on
Black masculine communities through digital platforms. This convergent
mixed-methods study analysed 11,306 YouTube comments following rapper Lil
Wayne's unprecedented disclosure of childhood suicide attempt and lifelong
mental health struggles. Quantitative analysis using VADER sentiment
classification, Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modelling, and NRC emotion
lexicon analysis revealed predominantly positive sentiment with systematic
community amplification of mental health discourse. Reflexive thematic analysis
of 2,100 high-engagement comments identified eight themes, with peer support
achieving the highest saturation, contradicting isolation narratives. Findings
support a Digital Permission Structures Model demonstrating how intersectional
celebrity status (race + gender + high-status), hip-hop authenticity values,
and digital platform affordances create triadic authorisation mechanisms
enabling vulnerability expression. Community responses revealed communal
masculinity rooted in Ubuntu philosophy and active reconstruction of masculine
norms, positioning help-seeking as strength. Results challenge deficit-based
models of Black masculinity, suggesting interventions should leverage
collectivism, partner with high-status cultural figures, employ strength-based
messaging, and centre hip-hop authenticity rather than imposing Western
individualistic frameworks. This study provides evidence-based strategies for
culturally responsive mental health interventions addressing persistent
disparities in Black men's service utilisation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解AI开发者目前在模型报告中包含或省略了哪些评估方法细节，以帮助建立公众对AI系统的信任，并促进第三方评审。

Method: 使用STREAM (v1) 标准比较三个前沿AI模型报告中的化学和生物安全基准评估报告实践。

Result: 每个模型报告都包含其他报告没有的有用细节，所有报告都有需要改进的领域，特别是在提供测试材料示例和详细激发条件列表方面。

Conclusion: 建议AI开发者通过在当前报告有限的领域提高透明度，继续加强评估科学的发展。

Abstract: Most frontier AI developers publicly document their safety evaluations of new
AI models in model reports, including testing for chemical and biological
(ChemBio) misuse risks. This practice provides a window into the methodology of
these evaluations, helping to build public trust in AI systems, and enabling
third party review in the still-emerging science of AI evaluation. But what
aspects of evaluation methodology do developers currently include -- or omit --
in their reports? This paper examines three frontier AI model reports published
in spring 2025 with among the most detailed documentation: OpenAI's o3,
Anthropic's Claude 4, and Google DeepMind's Gemini 2.5 Pro. We compare these
using the STREAM (v1) standard for reporting ChemBio benchmark evaluations.
Each model report included some useful details that the others did not, and all
model reports were found to have areas for development, suggesting that
developers could benefit from adopting one another's best reporting practices.
We identified several items where reporting was less well-developed across all
model reports, such as providing examples of test material, and including a
detailed list of elicitation conditions. Overall, we recommend that AI
developers continue to strengthen the emerging science of evaluation by working
towards greater transparency in areas where reporting currently remains
limited.

Motivation: 解决司法决策中多标准异质加权法律规则应用的根本挑战，确保立法意图的一致实现，特别是在非金钱损害赔偿量化方面。

Method: 使用结构化提示框架Soppia，以巴西CLT第223-G条中的12个非金钱损害赔偿标准为案例研究，将微妙的法律指令操作化为实用、可复制和透明的方法论。

Result: Soppia框架确保对所有规定标准进行全面平衡的分析，增强一致性和可预测性，同时提供可适应多标准法律环境的通用且可解释的工具。

Conclusion: Soppia在规范解释和计算推理之间架起桥梁，实现可审计的法律AI，为复杂法律规则的系统应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Applying complex legal rules characterized by multiple, heterogeneously
weighted criteria presents a fundamental challenge in judicial decision-making,
often hindering the consistent realization of legislative intent. This
challenge is particularly evident in the quantification of non-pecuniary
damages in personal injury cases. This paper introduces Soppia, a structured
prompting framework designed to assist legal professionals in navigating this
complexity. By leveraging advanced AI, the system ensures a comprehensive and
balanced analysis of all stipulated criteria, fulfilling the legislator's
intent that compensation be determined through a holistic assessment of each
case. Using the twelve criteria for non-pecuniary damages established in the
Brazilian CLT (Art. 223-G) as a case study, we demonstrate how Soppia (System
for Ordered Proportional and Pondered Intelligent Assessment) operationalizes
nuanced legal commands into a practical, replicable, and transparent
methodology. The framework enhances consistency and predictability while
providing a versatile and explainable tool adaptable across multi-criteria
legal contexts, bridging normative interpretation and computational reasoning
toward auditable legal AI.

Conclusion: 尽管AI与核武器领域存在差异，但核能历史类比仍能为AI治理提供有价值的政策见解，政策制定者应继续批判性地借鉴这些历史先例来塑造有效的全球AI治理。

Abstract: The analogy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and nuclear weapons is
prominent in academic and policy discourse on AI governance. This chapter
reviews 43 scholarly works which explicitly draw on the nuclear domain to
derive lessons for AI governance. We identify four problem areas where
researchers apply nuclear precedents: (1) early development and governance of
transformative technologies; (2) international security risks and strategy; (3)
international institutions and agreements; and (4) domestic safety regulation.
While nuclear-inspired AI proposals are often criticised due to differences
across domains, this review clarifies how historical analogies can inform
policy development even when technological domains differ substantially.
Valuable functions include providing conceptual frameworks for analyzing
strategic dynamics, offering cautionary lessons about unsuccessful governance
approaches, and expanding policy imagination by legitimizing radical proposals.
Given that policymakers already invoke the nuclear analogy, continued critical
engagement with these historical precedents remains essential for shaping
effective global AI governance.

in predicting both physical dynamics and aspects of social behavior, yet
predominantly in separate silos. This division results in a systemic failure to
model the crucial interplay between physical environments and social
constructs, rendering current models fundamentally incapable of adequately
addressing the true complexity of real-world systems where physical and social
realities are inextricably intertwined. This position paper argues that the
systematic, bidirectional unification of physical and social predictive
capabilities is the next crucial frontier for world model development. We
contend that comprehensive world models must holistically integrate objective
physical laws with the subjective, evolving, and context-dependent nature of
social dynamics. Such unification is paramount for AI to robustly navigate
complex real-world challenges and achieve more generalizable intelligence. This
paper substantiates this imperative by analyzing core impediments to
integration, proposing foundational guiding principles (ACE Principles), and
outlining a conceptual framework alongside a research roadmap towards truly
holistic world models.

Method: 通过解释维基百科中立观点的含义，识别研究NPOV的常见挑战，并提供研究成果沟通指导。

Result: 为研究者提供了理解维基百科中立性的框架、研究挑战的应对策略以及提高研究影响力的沟通方法。

Conclusion: 本文旨在加速高质量的中立性研究，帮助维基百科社区继续改进百科全书编写工作。

Abstract: Writing Wikipedia with a neutral point of view is one of the five pillars of
Wikipedia. Although the topic is core to Wikipedia, it is relatively
understudied considering hundreds of research studies are published annually
about the project. We hypothesize that part of the reason for the low research
activity on the topic is that Wikipedia's definition of neutrality and its
importance are not well understood within the research community. Neutrality is
also an inherently challenging and contested concept. Our aim with this paper
is to accelerate high quality research in this space that can help Wikipedia
communities continue to improve their work in writing the encyclopedia. We do
this by helping researchers to learn what Neutral Point of View means in the
context of Wikipedia, identifying some common challenges with studying NPOV and
how to navigate them, and offering guidance on how researchers can communicate
the results of their work for increased impact on the ground for the benefit of
Wikipedia.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效处理复杂随机波动率模型下的投资组合优化问题，揭示了交易成本和波动率对投资策略的重要影响。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a portfolio selection problem with transaction
costs under a two-factor stochastic volatility structure, where volatility
follows a mean-reverting process with a stochastic mean-reversion level. The
model incorporates both proportional exogenous transaction costs and endogenous
costs modeled by a stochastic liquidity risk process. Using an option-implied
approach, we extract an S-shaped utility function that reflects investor
behavior and apply its concave envelope transformation to handle the
non-concavity. The resulting problem reduces to solving a five-dimensional
nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We employ a deep learning-based
policy iteration scheme to numerically compute the value function and the
optimal policy. Numerical experiments are conducted to analyze how both types
of transaction costs and stochastic volatility affect optimal investment
decisions.

### [238] [Jump risk premia in the presence of clustered jumps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21297)
*Francis Liu,Natalie Packham,Artur Sepp*

Main category: q-fin.MF

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双变量Hawkes过程的期权定价模型，该模型能够捕捉正负跳跃的自激励和交叉激励效应，生成具有不对称、时变偏度的收益动态，并能产生正或负的隐含波动率偏斜。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对加密货币、"迷因"股票、G-7货币和某些商品等资产，其隐含波动率偏斜可能随市场情绪变化而改变符号，需要更灵活的模型来捕捉这种动态特征。

Method: 使用双变量Hawkes过程建模正负跳跃的聚类效应，引入正负跳跃风险溢价参数来反映市场对正负跳跃的风险偏好，这些参数从期权数据中推断得出。

Result: 使用比特币期权进行实证研究，发现推断的跳跃风险溢价对BTC期货的持有成本和delta对冲期权策略的表现具有预测能力。

Conclusion: 该模型能够灵活匹配观察到的偏斜动态，为具有时变波动率偏斜特征的资产提供了有效的期权定价工具。

Abstract: This paper presents an option pricing model that incorporates clustered jumps
using a bivariate Hawkes process. The process captures both self- and
cross-excitation of positive and negative jumps, enabling the model to generate
return dynamics with asymmetric, time-varying skewness and to produce positive
or negative implied volatility skews. This feature is especially relevant for
assets such as cryptocurrencies, so-called ``meme'' stocks, G-7 currencies, and
certain commodities, where implied volatility skews may change sign depending
on prevailing sentiment. We introduce two additional parameters, namely the
positive and negative jump premia, to model the market risk preferences for
positive and negative jumps, inferred from options data. This enables the model
to flexibly match observed skew dynamics. Using Bitcoin (BTC) options, we
empirically demonstrate how inferred jump risk premia exhibit predictive power
for both the cost of carry in BTC futures and the performance of delta-hedged
option strategies.
