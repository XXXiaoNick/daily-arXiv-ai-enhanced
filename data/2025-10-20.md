### [1] [Rethinking Toxicity Evaluation in Large Language Models: A Multi-Label Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15007)
*Zhiqiang Kou,Junyang Chen,Xin-Qiang Cai,Ming-Kun Xie,Biao Liu,Changwei Wang,Lei Feng,Yuheng Jia,Gang Niu,Masashi Sugiyama,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了三个多标签毒性检测基准Q-A-MLL、R-A-MLL和H-X-MLL，基于15类毒性分类体系，并开发了基于伪标签的毒性检测方法，显著优于GPT-4o和DeepSeek等先进基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前毒性检测器主要依赖单标签基准，无法充分捕捉现实世界毒性提示的模糊性和多维度特性，导致有偏评估，包括漏检和误报，影响检测器可靠性。

Method: 从公共毒性数据集构建三个多标签基准，采用15类毒性分类体系进行标注，提出基于伪标签的毒性检测方法，并理论证明伪标签训练优于单标签监督。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著超越了包括GPT-4o和DeepSeek在内的先进基线，能够更准确可靠地评估LLM生成内容中的多标签毒性。

Conclusion: 提出的多标签基准和伪标签方法有效解决了毒性检测中的评估偏差问题，为LLM生成内容的多标签毒性评估提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a range
of natural language processing tasks, but their potential to generate harmful
content has raised serious safety concerns. Current toxicity detectors
primarily rely on single-label benchmarks, which cannot adequately capture the
inherently ambiguous and multi-dimensional nature of real-world toxic prompts.
This limitation results in biased evaluations, including missed toxic
detections and false positives, undermining the reliability of existing
detectors. Additionally, gathering comprehensive multi-label annotations across
fine-grained toxicity categories is prohibitively costly, further hindering
effective evaluation and development. To tackle these issues, we introduce
three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \textbf{Q-A-MLL},
\textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets
and annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide
a theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels
yields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision.
In addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method.
Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses
advanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate
and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content.

### [2] [Can generative AI figure out figurative language? The influence of idioms on essay scoring by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15009)
*Enis Oğuz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了生成式AI模型对包含和不包含习语的学生作文的评分表现，发现Gemini在与人评分者的一致性方面表现最佳，特别是在处理包含多个习语的作文时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI技术在自动作文评分系统中的潜在应用，本研究旨在评估AI模型在处理包含习语的作文时的评分表现，以了解其局限性。

Method: 从348篇学生作文中创建两个相等的列表：一个包含多个习语，另一个不含习语。使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Deepseek三个生成式AI模型，按照人类评分者使用的相同评分标准对两组作文进行三次评分。

Result: 所有模型都表现出良好的一致性，但Gemini在与人评分者的评分者间信度方面表现最佳。AI评估未检测到对任何人口群体的偏见。对于包含多个习语的作文，Gemini的评分模式与人类评分者最为相似。

Conclusion: 虽然研究中所有模型都展示了混合方法的潜力，但Gemini因其处理比喻性语言的能力而成为最佳候选，未来有望单独处理作文评分任务。

Abstract: The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for
numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been
proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays
automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing
idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models
for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus
Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created
from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present
in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models
(ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists
three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay
scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini
outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There
was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For
essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to
human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid
approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to
handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks
alone in the future.

### [3] [A Generalizable Rhetorical Strategy Annotation Model Using LLM-based Debate Simulation and Labelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15081)
*Shiyu Ji,Farnoosh Hashemi,Joice Chen,Juanwen Pan,Weicheng Ma,Hefan Zhang,Sophia Pan,Ming Cheng,Shubham Mohole,Saeed Hassanpour,Soroush Vosoughi,Michael Macy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出利用大语言模型自动生成和标注辩论数据的新框架，基于四种修辞类型训练分类器，在多个外部语料库上验证性能，并应用于说服力预测和总统辩论分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 修辞策略分析依赖人工标注，成本高、不一致且难以扩展，现有数据集局限于特定主题和策略，限制了模型开发。

Method: 利用大语言模型自动生成和标注合成辩论数据，基于因果、经验、情感、道德四种修辞类型微调transformer分类器，并在人类标注数据和多个外部语料库上验证。

Result: 模型实现高性能和强泛化能力，在说服力预测中整合修辞策略标签可提升性能，分析显示美国总统辩论中情感论证使用增加。

Conclusion: 该框架为修辞策略分析提供了可扩展的解决方案，揭示了政治辩论中修辞策略的演变趋势。

Abstract: Rhetorical strategies are central to persuasive communication, from political
discourse and marketing to legal argumentation. However, analysis of rhetorical
strategies has been limited by reliance on human annotation, which is costly,
inconsistent, difficult to scale. Their associated datasets are often limited
to specific topics and strategies, posing challenges for robust model
development. We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and label synthetic debate data based on a
four-part rhetorical typology (causal, empirical, emotional, moral). We
fine-tune transformer-based classifiers on this LLM-labeled dataset and
validate its performance against human-labeled data on this dataset and on
multiple external corpora. Our model achieves high performance and strong
generalization across topical domains. We illustrate two applications with the
fine-tuned model: (1) the improvement in persuasiveness prediction from
incorporating rhetorical strategy labels, and (2) analyzing temporal and
partisan shifts in rhetorical strategies in U.S. Presidential debates
(1960-2020), revealing increased use of affective over cognitive argument in
U.S. Presidential debates.

### [4] [Continual Learning via Sparse Memory Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15103)
*Jessy Lin,Luke Zettlemoyer,Gargi Ghosh,Wen-Tau Yih,Aram Markosyan,Vincent-Pierre Berges,Barlas Oğuz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出稀疏记忆微调方法，通过只更新被新知识高度激活的记忆槽，在保持新知识学习能力的同时显著减少灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型部署后通常是静态的，持续学习面临灾难性遗忘的挑战。受参数共享导致遗忘的直觉启发，研究稀疏参数更新是否能实现无灾难性遗忘的学习。

Method: 引入稀疏记忆微调，利用记忆层模型的设计特性，只更新被新知识高度激活的记忆槽，减少新知识与模型已有能力之间的干扰。

Result: 在两个问答任务上的评估显示，稀疏记忆微调在学习新知识的同时遗忘显著减少：NaturalQuestions F1仅下降11%，而全微调下降89%，LoRA下降71%。

Conclusion: 记忆层中的稀疏性为大语言模型的持续学习提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A
major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is
catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired
capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is
challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we
investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging
memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by
design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new
piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce
interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We
evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and
parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We
find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting
substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after
full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields
only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results
suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual
learning in large language models.

### [5] [Measuring the Effect of Disfluency in Multilingual Knowledge Probing Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15115)
*Kirill Semenov,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现MLAMA等多语言事实知识评估基准中的模板翻译方法存在语法和语义问题，通过使用整句翻译方法显著提高了知识检索分数，建议控制多语言数据集的语法质量以获得更可解释的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言事实知识评估基准（如MLAMA）使用模板翻译方法，忽略了命名实体的语法和语义信息，导致最终提示存在语法错误或措辞不当，特别是在形态丰富的语言中，这影响了分数解释的可靠性。

Method: 从MLAMA数据集中选取4种斯拉夫语言，比较初始模板翻译与Google Translate和ChatGPT整句翻译的知识检索分数，并对5种其他语系语言进行额外分析。

Result: 观察到知识检索分数显著提高，整句翻译方法能更好地处理语法和语义问题，在其他语系语言中也观察到类似模式。

Conclusion: 建议研究社区控制高度多语言数据集的语法质量，使用神经机器翻译或LLM系统进行整句翻译可以近似实现这一目标，从而获得更高且更可解释的结果。

Abstract: For multilingual factual knowledge assessment of LLMs, benchmarks such as
MLAMA use template translations that do not take into account the grammatical
and semantic information of the named entities inserted in the sentence. This
leads to numerous instances of ungrammaticality or wrong wording of the final
prompts, which complicates the interpretation of scores, especially for
languages that have a rich morphological inventory. In this work, we sample 4
Slavic languages from the MLAMA dataset and compare the knowledge retrieval
scores between the initial (templated) MLAMA dataset and its sentence-level
translations made by Google Translate and ChatGPT. We observe a significant
increase in knowledge retrieval scores, and provide a qualitative analysis for
possible reasons behind it. We also make an additional analysis of 5 more
languages from different families and see similar patterns. Therefore, we
encourage the community to control the grammaticality of highly multilingual
datasets for higher and more interpretable results, which is well approximated
by whole sentence translation with neural MT or LLM systems. The dataset and
all related code is published at the Github repository:
https://github.com/ZurichNLP/Fluent-mLAMA.

### [6] [Latent Topic Synthesis: Leveraging LLMs for Electoral Ad Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15125)
*Alexander Brady,Tunazzina Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的框架，通过无监督聚类和基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型自动从无标签语料库生成可解释的主题分类法，并应用于2024年美国总统选举前的Meta政治广告分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台在塑造政治话语中起关键作用，但分析其庞大且快速演变的内容仍面临重大挑战，需要可扩展且可解释的分析方法。

Method: 结合无监督聚类与基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型迭代构建分类法，无需种子集或领域专业知识。

Result: 发现投票和移民广告占主导支出和展示量，而堕胎和选举诚信话题获得不成比例的关注度；资金模式呈现极化，不同议题的道德框架存在差异。

Conclusion: 该框架支持对社交媒体政治信息进行可扩展、可解释的分析，帮助研究者、政策制定者和公众更好地理解新兴叙事、极化动态和数字政治沟通的道德基础。

Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse,
but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major
challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an
interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining
unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large
language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring
seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of
Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the
2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse
structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics
with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting
and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion
and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are
equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs,
abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and
crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing
of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression
rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and
liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong
correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also
emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political
messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public
to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral
underpinnings of digital political communication.

TL;DR: FarsiMCQGen是一个用于生成波斯语多项选择题的创新方法，通过候选生成、过滤和排序技术，结合Transformer和知识图谱，在低资源语言环境下生成高质量的多项选择题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在波斯语等低资源语言中生成高质量的多项选择题存在显著挑战，需要开发专门的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 结合候选生成、过滤和排序技术，利用Transformer和知识图谱与基于规则的方法相结合，生成可信的干扰项。基于维基百科的通用知识问题数据构建。

Result: 创建了一个包含10,289个问题的波斯语多项选择题数据集，并通过最先进的大型语言模型进行评估，证明了模型的有效性和生成数据集的质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在波斯语多项选择题生成方面表现出色，生成的数据集具有高质量，有望推动多项选择题研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used in educational testing, as
they offer an efficient means of evaluating learners' knowledge. However,
generating high-quality MCQs, particularly in low-resource languages such as
Persian, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces FarsiMCQGen, an
innovative approach for generating Persian-language MCQs. Our methodology
combines candidate generation, filtering, and ranking techniques to build a
model that generates answer choices resembling those in real MCQs. We leverage
advanced methods, including Transformers and knowledge graphs, integrated with
rule-based approaches to craft credible distractors that challenge test-takers.
Our work is based on data from Wikipedia, which includes general knowledge
questions. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel Persian MCQ dataset
comprising 10,289 questions. This dataset is evaluated by different
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model and the quality of the generated dataset, which has
the potential to inspire further research on MCQs.

### [8] [Structure-R1: Dynamically Leveraging Structural Knowledge in LLM Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15191)
*Junlin Wu,Xianrui Zhong,Jiashuo Sun,Bolian Li,Bowen Jin,Jiawei Han,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Structure-R1框架，通过强化学习将检索内容转换为结构化表示，优化多步推理任务，在7B规模模型上达到与大模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统使用非结构化文本导致信息密度低、推理效果不佳，需要更高效的结构化知识表示来增强推理能力。

Method: 使用强化学习学习内容表示策略，动态生成任务特定的结构化格式，并引入自奖励结构验证机制确保表示质量。

Result: 在7个知识密集型基准测试中，7B规模模型达到与大模型竞争的性能，结构化表示提高了信息密度和上下文清晰度。

Conclusion: Structure-R1通过生成式结构化表示有效提升了推理性能，证明了结构化知识表示在增强LLM推理能力方面的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by
limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as
context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically
operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information
density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into
structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement
learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that
dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of
multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our
approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific
structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and
reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural
verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both
correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive
benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive
performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much
larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how
structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density
and contextual clarity. Our code and data are available at:

### [9] [Extending Audio Context for Long-Form Understanding in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15231)
*Yuatyong Chaichana,Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Warit Sirichotedumrong,Potsawee Manakul,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Partial YaRN和VLAT训练策略，用于扩展大型音频语言模型的音频上下文长度，同时保持文本能力不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型受限于短音频上下文窗口，即使其文本主干支持长上下文，这限制了长格式音频理解能力。

Method: Partial YaRN：基于RoPE的无训练音频专用扩展方法，只修改音频token位置；VLAT：将Partial YaRN扩展到训练时的位置增强策略，模拟不同音频长度进行训练。

Result: 在SALMONN和Qwen2-Audio上的实验表明，Partial YaRN在多种设置下优于原始模型，VLAT训练策略显著提升性能，在未见长度的长音频上表现强劲。

Conclusion: Partial YaRN和VLAT方法有效扩展了音频语言模型的上下文长度，实现了对长音频的更好理解，同时保持了文本能力。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio
context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting
long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension
methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains
unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce
Partial YaRN, a training-free, audio-only extension method that modifies only
audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's
text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a
training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional
augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling
generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving
robustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and
Qwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide
range of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement,
achieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths.

### [10] [Planner and Executor: Collaboration between Discrete Diffusion And Autoregressive Models in Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15244)
*Lina Berrayana,Ahmed Heakl,Muhammad Abdullah Sohail,Thomas Hofmann,Salman Khan,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索了离散扩散语言模型（DDLM）与自回归语言模型（ARM）的混合架构，通过文本空间和潜在空间的协作，实现了更高的准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归语言模型虽然准确率高但需要长序列标记，成本高昂。离散扩散语言模型具有并行生成和固定步骤的优势，在复杂推理任务中表现优异。研究旨在探索两种模型的协作能否带来互补优势。

Method: 首先在文本空间进行协作，一个模型规划推理过程，另一个基于规划执行最终答案。然后扩展到潜在空间通信，引入学习投影器将DDLM潜在表示映射到ARM嵌入空间。

Result: 从文本空间转向潜在空间的DDLM-ARM通信带来显著准确性提升：DART-5从27.0%提升到54.0%，AIME24从0.0%提升到14.0%。混合架构在保持准确性的同时大幅节省计算资源。

Conclusion: DDLM规划器与ARM执行器的组合在潜在空间协作能提供实质性计算节省且不影响准确性，为DDLM在混合架构中的推理应用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but
require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language
models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of
steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex
reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid
architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration
can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space,
where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final
answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space
communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the
ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation
limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM
communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy
gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to
14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM
executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact
on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for
planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME,
despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights
into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid
architectures.

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了用于文档理解的多模态检索增强生成技术，提出了基于领域、检索模态和粒度的分类法，总结了关键数据集、基准和应用，并指出了效率、细粒度表示和鲁棒性方面的开放挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档理解方法存在局限性：OCR+LLM流水线会丢失结构细节，原生多模态LLM在上下文建模方面存在困难。文档的多模态特性需要更先进的范式来支持跨所有模态的整体检索和推理。

Method: 提出多模态RAG方法，建立了基于领域、检索模态和粒度的分类法，回顾了涉及图结构和代理框架的进展，并总结了关键数据集、基准和应用。

Result: 多模态RAG能够实现跨所有模态的整体检索和推理，解锁全面的文档智能，为文档AI提供了系统性的技术框架和发展路线图。

Conclusion: 多模态RAG是文档理解的重要发展方向，但在效率、细粒度表示和鲁棒性方面仍面临挑战，需要未来的进一步研究来解决这些问题。

Abstract: Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis
to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines
feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face
key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles
with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models
in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text,
tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG.
This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities,
unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this
paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document
understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and
granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic
frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and
highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and
robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了Jaccard系数和余弦相似度在自动作文评分中的表现，发现余弦相似度表现更好，且一元文法比二元和三元文法具有更低的RMSE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动作文评分需要高效准确的评估工具，本研究旨在探索不同相似度度量方法在向量空间模型中的有效性。

Method: 使用一元、二元和三元文法进行特征提取和向量化，然后分别计算Jaccard系数和余弦相似度，通过RMSE评估系统性能。

Result: 余弦相似度优于Jaccard系数，一元文法相比二元和三元文法具有更低的RMSE。

Conclusion: 在自动作文评分中，余弦相似度配合一元文法特征提取能获得更好的评分效果。

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a vital area of research aiming to provide
efficient and accurate assessment tools for evaluating written content. This
study investigates the effectiveness of two popular similarity metrics, Jaccard
coefficient, and Cosine similarity, within the context of vector space
models(VSM)employing unigram, bigram, and trigram representations. The data
used in this research was obtained from the formative essay of the citizenship
education subject in a junior high school. Each essay undergoes preprocessing
to extract features using n-gram models, followed by vectorization to transform
text data into numerical representations. Then, similarity scores are computed
between essays using both Jaccard coefficient and Cosine similarity. The
performance of the system is evaluated by analyzing the root mean square error
(RMSE), which measures the difference between the scores given by human graders
and those generated by the system. The result shows that the Cosine similarity
outperformed the Jaccard coefficient. In terms of n-gram, unigrams have lower
RMSE compared to bigrams and trigrams.

*Mucheng Ren,He Chen,Yuchen Yan,Danqing Hu,Jun Xu,Xian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TraceCoder是一个集成多源外部知识的新型ICD编码框架，通过动态整合UMLS、维基百科和LLMs等知识源来增强代码表示、弥合语义差距，并处理罕见和模糊代码，提高可追溯性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICD编码方法面临临床文本与ICD代码之间的语义差距、罕见和长尾代码性能差以及可解释性有限等挑战。

Method: 提出TraceCoder框架，动态整合多源外部知识（UMLS、维基百科、LLMs），采用混合注意力机制建模标签、临床上下文和知识之间的交互。

Result: 在MIMIC-III-ICD9、MIMIC-IV-ICD9和MIMIC-IV-ICD10数据集上的实验表明，TraceCoder实现了最先进的性能，消融研究验证了其组件的有效性。

Conclusion: TraceCoder为自动化ICD编码提供了可扩展且稳健的解决方案，符合临床对准确性、可解释性和可靠性的需求。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns
standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a
critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges
such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on
rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these
issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source
external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding.
TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS,
Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations,
bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a
hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical

*Mucheng Ren,Yucheng Yan,He Chen,Danqing Hu,Jun Xu,Xian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TACL（阈值自适应课程学习）框架，通过动态调整训练过程基于样本复杂度，在医疗文本理解任务中取得显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗文本（特别是电子病历）具有非结构化、领域特定语言和上下文变异性等特点，现有方法将所有数据视为同等挑战，忽略了临床记录中复杂度的内在差异，限制了模型在罕见或复杂病例上的泛化能力

Method: 受渐进学习原则启发，TACL将数据按难度分类，在训练早期优先处理简单案例，建立坚实基础后再处理更复杂记录

Result: 在包括英语和中文临床记录的多语言医疗数据上应用TACL，在自动ICD编码、再入院预测和中医证候鉴别等临床任务中观察到显著改进

Conclusion: TACL不仅提升了自动化系统性能，还展示了统一不同医疗领域方法的潜力，为更准确、可扩展和全球适用的医疗文本理解解决方案铺平了道路

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a
cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient
care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for
advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their
unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts
make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements
in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as
equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across
clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively
generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present
TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to
address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts
during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL
dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual
samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler
cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling
more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including
English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements
across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission
prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the
performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify
approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,
scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了EGP框架，通过检索相似示例问题及其成功推理路径来指导LLM在知识图谱问答中的规划过程，显著提升了问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在知识图谱问答中存在的语义鸿沟问题，以及训练无关方法未能充分利用训练数据中宝贵推理模式的问题。

Method: EGP框架：1）通过实体模板化预处理训练集问题；2）使用语义嵌入和FAISS索引检索相似示例；3）在任务分解和关系探索两个阶段动态指导LLM规划；4）引入智能前瞻机制提高效率。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ两个真实世界KGQA数据集上的实验表明，PoG-EGP显著优于基线PoG系统和其他对比方法。

Conclusion: EGP框架通过示例引导规划有效提升了LLM在知识图谱问答中的规划能力，证明了利用训练数据中成功推理模式的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise
in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the
semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph
(KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient
exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable
reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning
capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set
questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then
retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning
paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient
FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning
process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated
sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by
providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning
accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during
relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising
paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the
Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two
real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP
significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.

TL;DR: CoordGen是一个移动设备推理框架，通过结合推测解码和动态硬件调度来加速上下文感知的文本生成，在移动设备上实现高达3.8倍的生成速度提升和4.7倍的能效提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备上的大语言模型虽然可以通过本地数据进行个性化生成，但逐令牌的生成过程由于内存限制特性导致高延迟和硬件利用率低的问题。

Method: 提出CoordGen框架，包含三个协同组件：自适应执行调度、上下文对齐草稿生成和硬件高效的草稿扩展，通过动态平衡计算图、在线校准和重用中间序列来优化推理过程。

Result: 在多个智能手机和代表性工作负载上的实验显示，相比现有移动推理解决方案，生成速度提升高达3.8倍，能效提升高达4.7倍。

Conclusion: CoordGen通过推测解码与动态硬件调度的集成，有效解决了移动设备上LLM推理的内存限制问题，显著提升了生成性能和能效。

Abstract: Enhancing on-device large language models (LLMs) with contextual information
from local data enables personalized and task-aware generation, powering use
cases such as intelligent assistants and UI agents. While recent developments
in neural processors have substantially improved the efficiency of prefill on
mobile devices, the token-by-token generation process still suffers from high
latency and limited hardware utilization due to its inherently memory-bound
characteristics. This work presents CoordGen, a mobile inference framework that
integrates speculative decoding with dynamic hardware scheduling to accelerate
context-aware text generation on mobile devices. The framework introduces three
synergistic components: (1) adaptive execution scheduling, which dynamically
balances compute graphs between prefill and decoding phases; (2)
context-aligned drafting, which improves speculative efficiency through
lightweight online calibration to current tasks; and (3) hardware-efficient
draft extension, which reuses and expands intermediate sequences to improve
processing parallelism and reduce verification cost. Experiments on multiple
smartphones and representative workloads show consistent improvements of up to
3.8x in generation speed and 4.7x in energy efficiency compared with existing
mobile inference solutions. Component-level analysis further validates the
contribution of each optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型在古典诗歌生成和评估领域的表现，目前这方面的研究还很缺乏。

Method: 采用三步评估框架：计算指标、LLM作为评判者评估、人类专家验证，评估了六个最先进的LLM在诗歌质量多个维度上的表现。

Result: 发现LLM在评估创意质量时存在"回音室"效应，常常收敛于与人类判断不同的有缺陷标准。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为文学生成代理的能力既有潜力也有局限，在文化和技术上复杂的创意任务中仍需要人类和模型的混合验证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative domains,
yet their performance in classical Chinese poetry generation and evaluation
remains poorly understood. We propose a three-step evaluation framework that
combines computational metrics, LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and human expert
validation. Using this framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across
multiple dimensions of poetic quality, including themes, emotions, imagery,
form, and style. Our analysis reveals systematic generation and evaluation
biases: LLMs exhibit "echo chamber" effects when assessing creative quality,
often converging on flawed standards that diverge from human judgments. These
findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current capabilities
of LLMs as proxy for literacy generation and the limited evaluation practices,
thereby demonstrating the continued need of hybrid validation from both humans
and models in culturally and technically complex creative tasks.

TL;DR: AutoGraph-R1是首个使用强化学习直接优化知识图谱构建以提升任务性能的框架，通过将图生成建模为策略学习问题，并设计任务感知的奖励函数来弥合KG构建与下游应用之间的脱节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱构建过程与下游应用脱节，导致图结构不理想，影响检索增强生成系统的效果。

Method: 使用强化学习训练LLM构造器，将图生成作为策略学习问题，设计两种任务感知奖励函数：知识载体图和知识索引图。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中，AutoGraph-R1显著提升了图RAG方法的性能，优于任务无关的基线图。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了构建与应用之间的闭环是可行的，将范式从构建内在"好"的图转向构建可证明"有用"的图。

Abstract: Building effective knowledge graphs (KGs) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) is pivotal for advancing question answering (QA) systems. However, its
effectiveness is hindered by a fundamental disconnect: the knowledge graph (KG)
construction process is decoupled from its downstream application, yielding
suboptimal graph structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce AutoGraph-R1, the
first framework to directly optimize KG construction for task performance using
Reinforcement Learning (RL). AutoGraph-R1 trains an LLM constructor by framing
graph generation as a policy learning problem, where the reward is derived from
the graph's functional utility in a RAG pipeline. We design two novel,
task-aware reward functions, one for graphs as knowledge carriers and another
as knowledge indices. Across multiple QA benchmarks, AutoGraph-R1 consistently
enables graph RAG methods to achieve significant performance gains over using
task-agnostic baseline graphs. Our work shows it is possible to close the loop
between construction and application, shifting the paradigm from building
intrinsically ``good'' graphs to building demonstrably ``useful'' ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动可读性评估领域存在可读性定义不一致和依赖表层文本属性的问题，需要探究人类可读性感知的真实因素。

Method: 分析了897个人类可读性判断，评估了15个传统可读性指标和6个基于模型的指标在5个英语数据集上的表现。

Result: 4个基于模型的指标在与人类判断的相关性排名中始终位列前四，而表现最好的传统指标平均排名仅为8.6。

Conclusion: 信息内容和主题对文本可理解性有重要影响，基于模型的方法是可读性评估更有前景的方向。

Abstract: Automatic readability assessment plays a key role in ensuring effective and
accessible written communication. Despite significant progress, the field is
hindered by inconsistent definitions of readability and measurements that rely
on surface-level text properties. In this work, we investigate the factors
shaping human perceptions of readability through the analysis of 897 judgments,
finding that, beyond surface-level cues, information content and topic strongly
shape text comprehensibility. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability
metrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced,
model-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics
consistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human
judgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average
rank of 8.6. These findings highlight a mismatch between current readability
metrics and human perceptions, pointing to model-based approaches as a more
promising direction.

TL;DR: SAFE是一个选择性集成LLM的框架，通过考虑分词不匹配和概率分布共识来选择集成位置，在长文本生成中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM集成方法在短文本中有效，但在长文本生成中由于在每个token处集成会导致性能下降，需要更智能的集成位置选择策略。

Method: 提出SAFE框架，基于分词不匹配和概率分布共识选择性集成，并引入概率锐化策略来合并相同单词的多个子词token的概率。

Result: 在MATH500和BBH等基准测试中，SAFE在准确性和效率上都优于现有方法，即使集成少于1%的token也能获得性能提升。

Conclusion: 选择性集成策略在长文本生成中至关重要，SAFE通过智能选择集成位置和概率锐化实现了稳定高效的LLM集成。

Abstract: Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising
approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their
complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token
probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be
effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers,
its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper,
we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a
careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of
ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key
factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models
and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we
propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively
ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability,
we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities
spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single
representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500
and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of
tokens.

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在多样化文档类型上泛化能力差，特别是对分布外数据表现不佳，且高质量布局感知解析训练数据有限。

Method: 使用强化学习框架LayoutRL，通过整合归一化编辑距离、段落计数准确性和阅读顺序保持的复合奖励来优化布局理解，并构建Infinity-Doc-400K数据集训练Infinity-Parser视觉语言模型。

Result: 在OmniDocBench、olmOCR-Bench、PubTabNet和FinTabNet等基准测试中，Infinity-Parser在各种文档类型、语言和结构复杂度上均达到最先进性能，显著优于专用文档解析系统和通用视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: LayoutRL框架和Infinity-Parser模型能够有效解决文档解析中的泛化问题，在多样化文档场景下表现出色，将发布代码、数据集和模型以促进可复现研究。

Abstract: Document parsing from scanned images into structured formats remains a
significant challenge due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text
paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Existing supervised fine-tuning
methods often struggle to generalize across diverse document types, leading to
poor performance, particularly on out-of-distribution data. This issue is
further exacerbated by the limited availability of high-quality training data
for layout-aware parsing tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
LayoutRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes layout
understanding through composite rewards integrating normalized edit distance,
paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. To support this
training, we construct the Infinity-Doc-400K dataset, which we use to train
Infinity-Parser, a vision-language model demonstrating robust generalization
across various domains. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including
OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of
document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially
outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose
vision-language models. We will release our code, dataset, and model to
facilitate reproducible research in document parsing.

Method: 引入VocalBench-DF评估框架，系统评估22个主流Speech-LLMs在语音不流畅场景下的表现，分析性能下降原因

Result: 主流Speech-LLMs在语音不流畅场景下性能显著下降，音素级处理和长上下文建模是主要瓶颈

Conclusion: 需要开发新方法来改进语音不流畅处理能力，构建真正包容的语音大模型，增强识别和推理能力是关键

Abstract: While Speech Large Language Models (Speech-LLMs) show strong performance in
many applications, their robustness is critically under-tested, especially to
speech disfluency. Existing evaluations often rely on idealized inputs,
overlooking common disfluencies, particularly those associated with conditions
like Parkinson's disease. This work investigates whether current Speech-LLMs
can maintain performance when interacting with users who have speech
impairments. To facilitate this inquiry, we introduce VocalBench-DF, a
framework for the systematic evaluation of disfluency across a
multi-dimensional taxonomy. Our evaluation of 22 mainstream Speech-LLMs reveals
substantial performance degradation, indicating that their real-world readiness
is limited. Further analysis identifies phoneme-level processing and
long-context modeling as primary bottlenecks responsible for these failures.
Strengthening recognition and reasoning capability from components and
pipelines can substantially improve robustness. These findings highlight the
urgent need for new methods to improve disfluency handling and build truly
inclusive Speech-LLMs

Motivation: 在线游戏平台需要有效的广告和推荐系统，但现有推荐方法不适合游戏场景，主要面临游戏稀疏性（游戏数量少）和游戏不平衡（用户行为集中在少数热门游戏）两大挑战。

Method: 引入用户游戏生命周期（UGL）来丰富用户行为，提出两种创新策略提取用户短期和长期兴趣，使用逆概率掩码策略进行UGL表示学习以解决游戏不平衡问题。

Result: 离线实验平均AUC提升1.83%，在线实验游戏广告点击转化率提升21.67%；游戏内物品推荐离线AUC提升0.5%，在线平均每用户收入提升0.82%。

Conclusion: UGL表示学习方法能有效解决游戏推荐中的稀疏性和不平衡问题，在游戏广告和游戏内物品推荐任务中都取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of video game production necessitates the development of
effective advertising and recommendation systems for online game platforms.
Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest
in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for
handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game
advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where
the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation
learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated
by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the
User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games.
Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user
behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To
tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking
strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental
results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by
achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online
increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a
0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一个专门化医学视觉语言模型的强大流程，验证了所得模型作为高质量查询生成器的能力，为增强多模态检索增强生成系统在循证临床决策支持中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based
guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their
effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language
Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This
study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for
generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a
synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains,
and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance
was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification
accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption
faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated
substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation
confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating
the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This
work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates
the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork
for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision
support.

Motivation: 现有MLLM评估主要关注被动推理，而现实世界应用往往需要在信息不完整的情况下主动获取证据。论文旨在研究MLLMs能否在信息不完整时主动获取缺失证据并迭代优化决策。

Method: 提出GuessBench基准，包含感知导向和知识导向的图像，要求模型在没有任务特定先验的情况下从候选池中选择目标图像，进行主动证据获取和迭代决策优化。评估了20个优秀MLLM模型。

Result: MLLMs在主动推理上的表现远低于被动推理设置，表明有巨大改进空间。细粒度感知和及时决策是主要挑战。消融研究表明感知增强对小模型有益，而思维导向方法对所有模型尺寸都有稳定提升。

Conclusion: 多模态主动推理是未来研究的有前景方向，需要进一步改进模型在信息不完整情况下的主动证据获取和决策能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities
across a broad range of benchmarks. However, most existing evaluations focus on
passive inference, where models perform step-by-step reasoning under complete
information. This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not
enough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing
evidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs
to actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under
incomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool
without task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose
GuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented
images for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs
and find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive
settings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis
identifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key
challenges. Ablation studies show that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller
models, whereas thinking-oriented methods provide consistent gains across model
sizes. These results suggest promising directions for future research on
multimodal active reasoning.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在摘要质量和可控性方面的问题，提升大语言模型生成摘要的准确性和可控性。

Method: 设计多阶段提示生成框架，包括语义分析、主题建模和噪声控制，使用CNN/Daily Mail数据集进行实验分析。

Result: 提示长度对摘要质量影响显著，过短或过长的提示都会降低质量；数据噪声增加会降低ROUGE-L分数；新闻文本处理效果最佳，学术文章处理效果较差。

Conclusion: 通过控制提示策略和优化文本预处理，可以提升大语言模型生成摘要的准确性和可控性，为改进摘要生成提供新思路。

Abstract: This study presents a controllable abstract summary generation method for
large language models based on prompt engineering. To address the issues of
summary quality and controllability in traditional methods, we design a
multi-stage prompt generation framework. This framework generates summaries
with varying levels of abstraction by performing semantic analysis, topic
modeling, and noise control on the input text. The experiment uses the
CNN/Daily Mail dataset and provides a detailed analysis of different prompt
lengths, data noise, and text types. The experimental results show that prompt
length has a significant impact on the quality of generated summaries. Both
very short and very long prompt tokens result in a decrease in summary quality.
Data noise also negatively affects the summary generation process. As noise
levels increase, the ROUGE-L score gradually decreases. Furthermore, different
text types have varying effects on the model's ability to generate summaries.
The model performs best when handling news texts, while its performance is
worse when processing academic articles. This research provides new insights
into improving summary generation using large language models, particularly in
how controlling prompt strategies and optimizing text preprocessing can enhance
summary accuracy and controllability.

TL;DR: CORE是一个协作框架，结合云端和本地LLM的优势，在保持移动代理任务准确性的同时减少UI暴露。通过布局感知块分区、协同规划和协同决策机制，可减少高达55.6%的UI暴露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云端LLM需要上传完整UI状态，暴露不必要且通常无关的信息；本地LLM避免UI上传但能力有限，导致任务成功率较低。需要一种既能保护隐私又能保持准确性的解决方案。

Method: CORE包含三个关键组件：1）基于XML屏幕层次结构的布局感知块分区；2）本地和云端LLM协同识别当前子任务；3）本地LLM对相关UI块排序，云端LLM在排名最高的块中选择特定UI元素。还引入了多轮累积机制来缓解本地误判。

Result: 实验表明，CORE在多样化移动应用和任务中，将UI暴露减少高达55.6%，同时任务成功率仅略低于纯云端代理，有效缓解了不必要的云端隐私暴露。

Conclusion: CORE成功平衡了隐私保护和任务准确性，为移动代理提供了一种有效的协作框架，既能减少UI信息暴露，又能维持较高的任务完成率。

Abstract: Mobile agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and execute tasks
on smartphone user interfaces (UIs). While cloud-based LLMs achieve high task
accuracy, they require uploading the full UI state at every step, exposing
unnecessary and often irrelevant information. In contrast, local LLMs avoid UI
uploads but suffer from limited capacity, resulting in lower task success
rates. We propose $\textbf{CORE}$, a $\textbf{CO}$llaborative framework that
combines the strengths of cloud and local LLMs to $\textbf{R}$educe UI
$\textbf{E}$xposure, while maintaining task accuracy for mobile agents. CORE
comprises three key components: (1) $\textbf{Layout-aware block partitioning}$,
which groups semantically related UI elements based on the XML screen
hierarchy; (2) $\textbf{Co-planning}$, where local and cloud LLMs
collaboratively identify the current sub-task; and (3)
$\textbf{Co-decision-making}$, where the local LLM ranks relevant UI blocks,
and the cloud LLM selects specific UI elements within the top-ranked block.
CORE further introduces a multi-round accumulation mechanism to mitigate local
misjudgment or limited context. Experiments across diverse mobile apps and
tasks show that CORE reduces UI exposure by up to 55.6% while maintaining task
success rates slightly below cloud-only agents, effectively mitigating
unnecessary privacy exposure to the cloud. The code is available at

### [28] [DeceptionBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for AI Deception Behaviors in Real-world Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15501)
*Yao Huang,Yitong Sun,Yichi Zhang,Ruochen Zhang,Yinpeng Dong,Xingxing Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeceptionBench是首个系统评估大语言模型欺骗行为的基准测试，涵盖5个社会领域150个场景，分析内在行为模式和外在因素影响，揭示模型在强化动态下欺骗行为加剧的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型能力的快速提升带来了新兴的欺骗行为，可能在高风险部署中引发严重风险，而现实场景中的欺骗特征研究仍不足。

Method: 建立包含经济、医疗、教育、社交互动和娱乐5个领域150个场景的基准测试，探索模型内在的利己主义或谄媚行为，以及外在因素（中性条件、奖励激励、强制压力）对欺骗输出的影响，并整合多轮交互循环模拟现实反馈动态。

Result: 对大语言模型和大推理模型的广泛实验揭示了关键脆弱性，特别是在强化动态下欺骗行为加剧，表明当前模型缺乏对操纵性上下文线索的鲁棒抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 迫切需要针对各种欺骗行为的先进安全防护措施，当前模型在抵抗操纵性上下文线索方面存在明显不足。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also
introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in
high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception
across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically
evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains,
what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect
them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150
meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare,
Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples,
providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the
intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic
tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the
extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive
outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive
pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to
construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics.
Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal
critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement
dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to
manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards
against various deception behaviors. Code and resources are publicly available
at https://github.com/Aries-iai/DeceptionBench.

*Ashutosh Bajpai,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为TEMP-ReCon的新基准来评估LLMs的时间指称一致性，并开发了UnTRaP模型来增强LLMs的时间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在各领域的广泛应用，特别是在时间敏感领域如法律、医疗和金融中，LLMs不仅需要事实准确性，还需要在时间维度上保持一致性。但目前缺乏评估和增强LLMs时间一致性的研究。

Method: 提出了TEMP-ReCon基准来评估开源和闭源LLMs的时间指称一致性，涵盖不同资源丰富度的语言环境（英语、法语、罗马尼亚语）。同时开发了UnTRaP模型，基于推理路径对齐来增强LLMs的时间一致性。

Result: 研究发现LLMs确实表现出不足的时间指称一致性。实验证明UnTRaP模型相比多个基线模型具有更好的效果。

Conclusion: LLMs在时间一致性方面存在不足，需要专门的评估方法和增强技术。提出的TEMP-ReCon基准和UnTRaP模型为解决这一问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The increasing acceptance of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative
to knowledge sources marks a significant paradigm shift across various domains,
including time-sensitive fields such as law, healthcare, and finance. To
fulfill this expanded role, LLMs must not only be factually accurate but also
demonstrate consistency across temporal dimensions, necessitating robust
temporal reasoning capabilities. Despite this critical requirement, efforts to
ensure temporal consistency in LLMs remain scarce including noticeable absence
of endeavors aimed at evaluating or augmenting LLMs across temporal references
in time-sensitive inquiries. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by
introducing a novel benchmark entitled temporal referential consistency,
accompanied by a resource TEMP-ReCon designed to benchmark a wide range of both
open-source and closed-source LLMs with various linguistic contexts
characterized by differing resource richness (including English, French, and
Romanian). The findings emphasis that LLMs do exhibit insufficient temporal
referent consistency. To address this, we propose \newmodel, a reasoning path
alignment-based model that aims to enhance the temporal referential consistency
of LLMs. Our empirical experiments substantiate the efficacy of UnTRaP compared
to several baseline models.

*Rares Dolga,Lucas Maystre,Tudor Berariu,David Barber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态字符分组方法，利用现有BPE分词结构，通过添加显式补丁结束标记和二级BPE压缩来控制补丁粒度，实现高效、灵活且语言无关的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决子词分词方法在表示罕见词时的低效性和需要大嵌入矩阵的问题，同时避免字符级模型的性能瓶颈和现有分层模型的局限性。

Method: 在现有BPE分词基础上添加显式补丁结束标记，然后进行二级BPE压缩来控制补丁粒度，无需额外模型依赖。

Result: 实证结果显示该方法在性能上匹配或优于基于动态熵和空白的补丁策略，同时保持紧凑的词汇表。

Conclusion: 提出的动态字符分组方法提供了一种高效、灵活且语言无关的表示方案，成功结合了子词和字符级模型的优势。

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used in
large language models due to their balance of vocabulary compactness and
representational power. However, they suffer from inefficiencies in
representing rare words and require large embedding matrices. Character-level
models address these issues but introduce performance bottlenecks, particularly
in Transformer-based architectures. Recent hierarchical models attempt to merge
the benefits of both paradigms by grouping characters into patches, but
existing patching strategies either rely on whitespace-limiting applicability
to certain languages, or require auxiliary models that introduce new
dependencies. In this paper, we propose a dynamic character grouping method
that leverages the structure of existing BPE tokenization without requiring
additional models. By appending explicit end-of-patch markers to BPE tokens and
introducing a second-level BPE compression stage to control patch granularity,
our method offers efficient, flexible, and language-agnostic representations.
Empirical results demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds the
performance of dynamic entropy- and whitespace-based patching strategies, while
maintaining a compact vocabulary.

*Jingcheng Deng,Liang Pang,Zihao Wei,Shichen Xu,Zenghao Duan,Kun Xu,Yang Song,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent-SFT是一种两阶段学习框架，通过在词汇概率的叠加空间中进行潜在推理，匹配显式推理性能的同时将推理链缩短4倍，在GSM8k等数学推理任务上达到新的最优水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式推理（如思维链）虽然效果好但计算开销大，现有潜在推理方法性能显著下降。研究发现性能下降源于非结构化的潜在空间难以拟合潜在标记。

Method: 提出Latent-SFT两阶段框架：第一阶段设计专用注意力掩码指导潜在标记编码器生成潜在标记；第二阶段丢弃编码器，直接训练LLM自主生成潜在标记进行推理，使用KL和CE损失优化。

Result: 在GSM8k上匹配显式SFT性能，推理链缩短4倍，超越先前潜在方法。在Math500和AIME24上，基于词汇概率的潜在推理明显优于基于隐藏状态的方法。

Conclusion: 潜在推理既是单一路径的压缩，也是多路径的叠加，有效压缩率和有效全局并行度指标验证了这一点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities with
chain-of-thought prompting, but explicit reasoning introduces substantial
computational overhead. Recent work on latent reasoning reduces this cost by
reasoning in latent space without explicit supervision, but performance drops
significantly. Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems
from the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens
difficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of
the LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over
vocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an
eigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,
we propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we
design two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in
generating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer
conditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is
discarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens
autonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT
sets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while
cutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent
methods. On Math500 and AIME24, lexical probability-based latent reasoning also
clearly surpasses hidden-state-based approaches. Our metrics of effective
compression rate and effective global parallelism further show that latent
reasoning is both the compression of a single path and the superposition of
multiple paths.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种模态组合感知框架，通过偏好损失和组合正则化目标来缓解统一编码器在多模态检索中的模态捷径问题，提高分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管统一编码器在多模态检索中具有灵活性，但传统对比学习容易导致模态捷径问题，在分布偏移下表现不佳。

Method: 使用偏好损失强制多模态嵌入优于单模态嵌入，同时通过组合正则化目标将多模态嵌入与其单模态部分的组合原型对齐。

Result: 在各种基准测试中，该框架在分布外检索方面取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 模态组合感知是使用MLLMs作为统一编码器时实现鲁棒组合多模态检索的有效原则。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across
modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to
contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like
CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly
processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that
unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to
learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts.
We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue.
Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform
their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective
aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts.
These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed
representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks
show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition
awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval
when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.

TL;DR: 提出TokenTiming算法，通过动态时间规整技术实现通用推测解码，解决了传统推测解码需要草稿模型和目标模型共享词汇表的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法受限于草稿模型和目标模型必须共享相同词汇表，限制了可用草稿模型的选择范围，往往需要从头训练新模型。

Method: 使用动态时间规整算法重新编码草稿令牌序列得到新的目标令牌序列，建立映射关系来传递概率分布进行推测采样。

Result: 在多种任务上的综合实验显示实现了1.57倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了通用草稿模型选择，使推测解码成为更通用实用的LLM加速工具。

Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a
critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially
improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a
fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same
vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often
necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose
the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by
re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and
then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for
speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched
vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and
modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks,
demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft
model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM
acceleration.

TL;DR: 本文提出跨语言差距主要由目标语言响应的方差引起，而非潜在表征差异。通过偏置-方差分解形式化该问题，并通过推理时干预控制方差来减少跨语言差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将跨语言差距归因于源语言和目标语言潜在表征的差异，但本文提出不同观点，认为目标语言响应的方差是主要原因。

Method: 使用偏置-方差分解形式化跨语言差距，通过多种推理时干预措施控制响应方差，包括简单的提示指令。

Result: 实验证明提出的假设和形式化方法有效，通过控制方差可将目标语言准确率提高20-25%。

Conclusion: 跨语言差距主要源于目标语言响应的方差，通过推理时干预控制方差能有效减少这一差距。

Abstract: Any piece of knowledge is usually expressed in one or a handful of natural
languages on the web or in any large corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) act
as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it
accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a
cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a
target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing
research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and
target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an
alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target
language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the
cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive
experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We
then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions
that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a
simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved
target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ParallaxRAG框架，通过多视图空间对称解耦查询和知识图谱三元组，构建稳健的检索架构，在约束弱相关路径的同时显式增强头部多样性，以改善多跳推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言理解方面表现出色，但经常产生幻觉且在多跳推理方面存在困难。基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法提供了基础，但大多数方法依赖于扁平嵌入和噪声路径探索。

Method: ParallaxRAG框架将查询和知识图谱三元组对称解耦到多视图空间，利用不同注意力头在不同推理阶段专门处理语义关系的特性，构建更清晰的子图并引导LLM进行基于基础的逐步推理。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ数据集上的实验表明，该框架在检索和问答性能方面具有竞争力，同时减少了幻觉并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多视图头部专业化是知识基础多跳推理的一个原则性方向，为改善LLM的推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often
hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely
on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a
framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into
multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly
enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our
approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in
semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops
of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct
cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.
Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +
Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside
reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view
head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop
reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is
accepted.

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注英语模型，忽视了韩语等语言的独特语法、形态特征、敬语系统和双数系统等语言文化特性

Method: 开发了KITE基准，结合自动指标和人工评估，针对通用和韩语特定的开放指令跟随任务进行评估

Result: 评估揭示了不同模型间的性能差异，为理解模型优缺点提供了深入见解

Conclusion: 通过公开KITE数据集和代码，旨在促进文化和语言包容性LLM开发，并激励对其他弱势语言的类似研究

Abstract: The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex
reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English
models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages.
Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features,
honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for
assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific
instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual
knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended
instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics
with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and
providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly
releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar
endeavors for other underrepresented languages.

Abstract: This paper delves into the intricate world of Urdu poetry, exploring its
thematic depths through a lens of polysemy. By focusing on the nuanced
differences between three seemingly synonymous words (pyaar, muhabbat, and
ishq) we expose a spectrum of emotions and experiences unique to the Urdu
language. This study employs a polysemic case study approach, meticulously
examining how these words are interwoven within the rich tapestry of Urdu
poetry. By analyzing their usage and context, we uncover a hidden layer of
meaning, revealing subtle distinctions which lack direct equivalents in English
literature. Furthermore, we embark on a comparative analysis, generating word
embeddings for both Urdu and English terms related to love. This enables us to
quantify and visualize the semantic space occupied by these words, providing
valuable insights into the cultural and linguistic nuances of expressing love.
Through this multifaceted approach, our study sheds light on the captivating
complexities of Urdu poetry, offering a deeper understanding and appreciation
for its unique portrayal of love and its myriad expressions

Method: 提出跨语言双向最大相似度评分(BiMax)计算文档间相似度，替代最优传输方法

Result: 在WMT16双语文档对齐任务中，BiMax达到与最优传输方法相当的准确度，速度提升约100倍

Conclusion: BiMax方法在保持高精度的同时显著提升了文档对齐效率，并发布了EmbDA工具供公开使用

Abstract: Document alignment is necessary for the hierarchical mining (Ba\~n\'on et
al., 2020; Morishita et al., 2022), which aligns documents across source and
target languages within the same web domain. Several high precision sentence
embedding-based methods have been developed, such as TK-PERT (Thompson and
Koehn, 2020) and Optimal Transport (OT) (Clark et al., 2019; El-Kishky and
Guzm\'an, 2020). However, given the massive scale of web mining data, both
accuracy and speed must be considered. In this paper, we propose a
cross-lingual Bidirectional Maxsim score (BiMax) for computing doc-to-doc
similarity, to improve efficiency compared to the OT method. Consequently, on
the WMT16 bilingual document alignment task, BiMax attains accuracy comparable
to OT with an approximate 100-fold speed increase. Meanwhile, we also conduct a
comprehensive analysis to investigate the performance of current
state-of-the-art multilingual sentence embedding models. All the alignment
methods in this paper are publicly available as a tool called EmbDA

Abstract: While coreference resolution is attracting more interest than ever from
computational literature researchers, representative datasets of fully
annotated long documents remain surprisingly scarce. In this paper, we
introduce a new annotated corpus of three full-length French novels, totaling
over 285,000 tokens. Unlike previous datasets focused on shorter texts, our
corpus addresses the challenges posed by long, complex literary works, enabling
evaluation of coreference models in the context of long reference chains. We
present a modular coreference resolution pipeline that allows for fine-grained

TL;DR: HypoSpace是一个用于评估语言模型生成多种合理解释能力的诊断套件，关注假设的有效性、独特性和覆盖率，特别适用于科学领域中具有多种可能解释的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在科学工作流程中的广泛应用，需要评估它们提出多种解释（而非单一正确答案）的能力，因为许多科学问题存在多种机制不同的合理解释。

Method: 将LLMs视为有限假设集的采样器，测量三个指标：有效性（与观测一致的假设精度）、独特性（假设间的非冗余性）和覆盖率（对可接受假设集的覆盖程度）。在三个结构化领域实例化：因果图、重力约束3D体素重建和布尔遗传相互作用。

Result: 研究发现，在指令调优和推理导向模型中，有效性通常保持较高，但随着可接受空间增大，独特性和覆盖率会下降，揭示了仅靠正确性指标无法发现的模式崩溃问题。

Conclusion: HypoSpace提供了一个受控探测工具（而非排行榜），用于评估那些明确探索和覆盖可接受解释空间的方法。

Abstract: As language models are increasingly used in scientific workflows, evaluating
their ability to propose sets of explanations-not just a single correct
answer-becomes critical. Many scientific problems are underdetermined:
multiple, mechanistically distinct hypotheses are consistent with the same
observations. We introduce HypoSpace, a diagnostic suite that treats LLMs as
samplers of finite hypothesis sets and measures three complementary indicators:
Validity (precision of proposals consistent with observations), Uniqueness
(non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of the enumerated
admissible set). We instantiate HypoSpace in three structured domains with
deterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces: (i) causal
graphs from perturbations, (ii) gravity-constrained 3D voxel reconstruction
from top-down projections, and (iii) Boolean genetic interactions. Across
instruction-tuned and reasoning-focused models, Validity often remains high
while Uniqueness and Recovery degrade as the admissible space grows, revealing
mode collapse that is invisible to correctness-only metrics. HypoSpace offers a
controlled probe-rather than a leaderboard-for methods that explicitly explore
and cover admissible explanation spaces. Code is available at:

Result: 在文本Latent Hatred数据集和多模态MAMI数据集上，基于嵌入拼接的方法表现最佳，相比无上下文基线分别提升3和6个F1分数。

Conclusion: 上下文信息和整合方法对仇恨言论检测至关重要，LLM生成的背景知识能有效提升检测性能，特别是在多模态场景中。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach to textual and multimodal Hate
Speech Detection (HSD), using Large Language Models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge
bases to generate background context and incorporate it into the input of HSD
classifiers. Two context generation strategies are examined: one focused on
named entities and the other on full-text prompting. Four methods of
incorporating context into the classifier input are compared: text
concatenation, embedding concatenation, a hierarchical transformer-based
fusion, and LLM-driven text enhancement. Experiments are conducted on the
textual Latent Hatred dataset of implicit hate speech and applied in a
multimodal setting on the MAMI dataset of misogynous memes. Results suggest
that both the contextual information and the method by which it is incorporated
are key, with gains of up to 3 and 6 F1 points on textual and multimodal setups
respectively, from a zero-context baseline to the highest-performing system,
based on embedding concatenation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态调整检索文档长度的检索增强推理模型，通过强化学习训练成本感知模型，在保持效果的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强推理模型计算成本高昂，检索和推理token都消耗大量资源，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 1) 基于查询和检索结果动态调整检索文档列表长度；2) 开发成本感知优势函数用于强化学习训练；3) 探索内存和延迟约束下的实现方案。

Result: 在7个公开问答数据集上验证，模型延迟降低16-20%，准确率平均提升5%，在保持效果的同时显著提升效率。

Conclusion: 提出的成本感知检索增强推理框架能够在不牺牲性能的情况下显著降低计算成本，实现效率与效果的平衡。

Abstract: Reasoning models have gained significant attention due to their strong
performance, particularly when enhanced with retrieval augmentation. However,
these models often incur high computational costs, as both retrieval and
reasoning tokens contribute substantially to the overall resource usage. In
this work, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose a
retrieval-augmented reasoning model that dynamically adjusts the length of the
retrieved document list based on the query and retrieval results; (2) we
develop a cost-aware advantage function for training of efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning models through reinforcement learning; and (3) we
explore both memory- and latency-bound implementations of the proposed
cost-aware framework for both proximal and group relative policy optimization
algorithms. We evaluate our approach on seven public question answering
datasets and demonstrate significant efficiency gains, without compromising
effectiveness. In fact, we observed that the model latency decreases by ~16-20%
across datasets, while its effectiveness increases by ~5% on average, in terms
of exact match.

TL;DR: 本文实证分析了扩散语言模型(DLMs)的注意力机制，发现其存在动态变化的注意力下沉现象，但与自回归模型(ARMs)不同，DLMs对注意力下沉的移除具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型作为自回归模型的替代方案，其内部工作机制尚未被充分探索，特别是注意力模式的特点。

Method: 通过实证分析DLMs的注意力模式，重点关注注意力下沉现象，并与ARMs进行对比研究。

Result: 发现DLMs存在动态变化的注意力下沉现象，且对注意力下沉的移除具有鲁棒性，性能仅轻微下降。

Conclusion: 扩散语言模型在注意力分配和利用方式上与自回归模型存在根本性差异，这为理解扩散模型的工作原理提供了新视角。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ
transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token
generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency
and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that
govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical
analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking
phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based
architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but
with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in
DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic
behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention
sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in
performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of
diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how
they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法依赖固定格式任务和参考答案，难以捕捉现代LLM行为的细微、主观和开放性特征，需要更有效的评估方式。

Method: 提出自动相互评估框架，让LLM通过自玩和同行评审相互评估输出，结合博弈论投票算法聚合同行评审结果，并与人类判断进行对比验证。

Result: 实证结果显示理论预测与人类评估之间存在收敛和分歧，揭示了相互评估方法的潜力和局限性。

Conclusion: 这是首个将相互评估、博弈论聚合和基于人类的验证相结合的工作，为LLM能力评估提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether
principles from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of
large language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing
inadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on
fixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced,
subjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where
LLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer
assessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to
evaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates
game-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a
principled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human
preferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between
theoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into
the promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation,
game-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the
capabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需参考翻译的机器翻译质量评估方法，通过逐段翻译和shuffle测试来验证翻译器，特别适用于动物语言翻译等无参考翻译的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何验证AI动物语言翻译器的问题，避免与动物直接交互带来的安全、伦理和成本问题，探索仅通过英文输出来评估翻译质量的可能性。

Method: 使用逐段翻译结合经典的NLP shuffle测试，通过比较翻译结果在原始顺序和随机排列顺序下的合理性来评估翻译质量。

Result: 在数据稀缺的人类语言和构造语言上的概念验证实验表明，该方法与基于参考翻译的标准评估方法高度相关。

Conclusion: 交互在翻译学习的早期阶段可能不是必要的，也不高效；仅通过输出评估翻译器是可行的，为动物语言翻译等无参考翻译场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether
or not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on
grounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and
proof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even
observations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may
be able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering
potential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance
of machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference
translations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''
false translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using
segment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to
evaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by
turn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in
order than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human
languages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this
evaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to
validate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to
correlate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations,
which are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis
suggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early
stages of learning to translate.

TL;DR: 论文通过构建单层transformer玩具模型，揭示了语言模型中真假陈述线性分离子空间的产生机制，发现这种分离是通过两阶段学习动态形成的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明大语言模型存在区分真假陈述的线性子空间，但其产生机制尚不明确。本文旨在通过透明模型揭示这种线性真值表示的具体产生路径。

Method: 构建单层transformer玩具模型，在事实陈述共现的数据分布下进行训练，观察模型学习区分真假陈述的过程。

Result: 模型表现出两阶段学习动态：首先快速记忆个体事实关联，然后长时间学习线性分离真假陈述，从而降低语言建模损失。在预训练语言模型中也验证了这一模式。

Conclusion: 研究提供了线性真值表示在语言模型中产生机制的具体证明和经验动机，解释了为什么以及如何出现这种线性分离现象。

Abstract: Recent probing studies reveal that large language models exhibit linear
subspaces that separate true from false statements, yet the mechanism behind
their emergence is unclear. We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer
toy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one
concrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which
truth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements
co-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model
to learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We
corroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models.
Finally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks
first memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a
longer horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn
lowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a
mechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear
truth representations can emerge in language models.

Method: 提出Paper2Web基准数据集，包含连接性、完整性等基于规则的指标和人类验证的LLM评估；开发PWAgent自主管道，通过MCP工具迭代优化内容和布局。

Conclusion: Paper2Web为学术网页生成提供了全面的评估框架，PWAgent证明了在生成交互式多媒体学术主页方面的优越性能。

Abstract: Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they
clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction.
However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM)
generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce
layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this
task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark
dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic
webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity,
Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity,
aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level
knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that
converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic
homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP
tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments
show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like
template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while
maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage
generation.

Motivation: 由于非正式和领域特定语言的存在，准确检测产品评论和社交媒体中的情感极性和强度仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用VADER进行初始情感估计，通过DistilBERT的置信度分数和模糊逻辑进行两阶段调整，最终通过自定义模糊推理系统将分数映射到0-1连续区间。

Result: 在四个领域特定数据集上的评估显示，该方法与用户评分更一致，能更好识别情感极端值，减少误分类。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了将符号推理与神经模型相结合在语言动态领域中进行可解释、细粒度情感分析的价值。

Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and
social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific
language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer
framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and
fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity
and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment
estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This
involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight
transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive
neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then
maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like
judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific
datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show
improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment
extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics
(distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case
studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This
work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically
dynamic domains.

Conclusion: 为利用这些新兴模型提供了经验指导和见解，展示了在缩小与上界差距方面的实质性进展。

Abstract: Slot filling is a crucial subtask in spoken language understanding (SLU),
traditionally implemented as a cascade of speech recognition followed by one or
more natural language understanding (NLU) components. The recent advent of
speech-based large language models (speechLLMs), which integrate speech and
textual foundation models, has opened new avenues for achieving speech
understanding tasks in a more unified, generative, and instruction-following
manner while promising data and compute efficiency with zero-shot abilities,
generalizing to unseen slot labels. We address the slot-filling task by
creating an empirical upper bound for the task, identifying performance,
robustness, and generalization gaps, and proposing improvements to the training
data, architecture, and training strategies to narrow the gap with the upper
bound result. We show that each of these measures improve performance
substantially, while highlighting practical challenges and providing empirical
guidance and insights for harnessing these emerging models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ORBIT框架通过基于量规的增量强化学习，在开放式医学对话任务中显著提升模型性能，在HealthBench-Hard基准上从7.0提升至27.2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在数学、代码等有明确奖励函数的领域表现良好，但在开放式、主观性强的领域如医学咨询中缺乏有效的奖励函数，限制了模型在这些高风险任务中的应用。

Method: 提出ORBIT框架，结合合成对话生成和动态量规创建，使用量规指导的反馈来进行增量强化学习，无需外部医学知识或手动规则。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Instruct模型上，仅使用2k样本就将HealthBench-Hard基准性能从7.0提升至27.2，达到同规模模型的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 量规驱动的强化学习在复杂开放式任务中具有可扩展性，能够促进模型在多样化咨询场景中的一致性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be
programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models
benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based
objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in
open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or
context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably
medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas
challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT,
an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed
for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue
generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to
direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend
on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided
feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model,
our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard
benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving
state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that
rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse
consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These
findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing
LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法学习的技能往往过度专门化于单一网站，缺乏泛化能力。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够学习通用技能的框架。

Method: 受软件工程中多态性启发，PolySkill将技能的抽象目标（做什么）与具体实现（如何做）解耦，使智能体能够在不同环境中重用和组合技能。

Result: 实验显示：技能重用在已知网站上提升1.7倍；在Mind2Web和未见网站上成功率分别提升9.4%和13.9%；步骤减少超过20%；在自主探索中能学习跨网站通用的技能。

Conclusion: 将技能目标与执行分离是开发能够在开放网络中持续学习和泛化的自主智能体的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now
powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external
environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating
web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning
often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to
generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to
learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by
polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal
(what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed).
Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen
websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on
unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration
settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of
proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work
across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own
goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum,
leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline
methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of
continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating
a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing
autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web
continuously.

Abstract: The rapid decentralization and digitalization of local electricity markets
have introduced new cyber-physical vulnerabilities, including key leakage, data
tampering, and identity spoofing. Existing blockchain-based solutions provide
transparency and traceability but still depend on classical cryptographic
primitives that are vulnerable to quantum attacks. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes Q-EnergyDEX, a zero-trust distributed energy trading
framework driven by quantum key distribution and blockchain. The framework
integrates physical-layer quantum randomness with market-level operations,
providing an end-to-end quantum-secured infrastructure. A cloud-based Quantum
Key Management Service continuously generates verifiable entropy and regulates
key generation through a rate-adaptive algorithm to sustain high-quality
randomness. A symmetric authentication protocol (Q-SAH) establishes secure and
low-latency sessions, while the quantum-aided consensus mechanism (PoR-Lite)
achieves probabilistic ledger finality within a few seconds. Furthermore, a
Stackelberg-constrained bilateral auction couples market clearing with entropy
availability, ensuring both economic efficiency and cryptographic security.
Simulation results show that Q-EnergyDEX maintains robust key stability and
near-optimal social welfare, demonstrating its feasibility for large-scale
decentralized energy markets.

Motivation: 解决传统多旋翼飞行器无法实现全向运动的问题，同时避免过度驱动（超过6个输入）和平衡时的内力问题。

Method: 设计包含主动倾斜螺旋桨和3个被动万向节摆式连杆的结构，建立详细动力学模型，分析平衡配置，使用几何非线性控制器（动态反馈线性化和反步法）实现闭环系统稳定性。

Result: 理论分析证明存在强制平衡配置，控制器能实现渐近稳定，数值仿真验证了在非零初始条件、参数不确定性和执行器噪声下的解耦姿态和平移运动能力。

Conclusion: 该设计成功实现了仅用6个输入的全向多旋翼飞行器，平衡时无内力，控制器在多种扰动下表现鲁棒。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel concept for achieving omnidirectionality in a
multirotor aerial vehicle (MAV) that uses only 6 inputs and ensures no internal
forces at the equilibria. The concept integrates a single actively-tilting
propeller along with 3 pendulum-like links, each carrying a propeller,
connected by passive universal joints to the main body. We show that this
design ensures omnidirectionality while minimizing the internal forces and
without resorting to overactuation (i.e., more than 6 inputs). A detailed
dynamic model of the multi-link MAV is first developed. Afterwards, the
analysis identifies the equilibrium configurations and illustrates that a
forced equilibrium exists for every pose of the MAV's main platform. In order
to render this equilibrium asymptotically stable for the closed-loop system, a
geometric nonlinear controller is constructed using dynamic feedback
linearization and backstepping techniques with the main platform configuration
error being the left-trivialized error on SE(3). The stability of the
closed-loop system is then investigated by employing standard Lyapunov
arguments on the zero dynamics. We conclude by providing numerical simulations
validating the proposed approach. They demonstrate the MAV capability to
perform decoupled attitude and translational motions under non-zero initial
conditions, parametric uncertainty, and actuators noise.

Conclusion: 所提出的鲁棒暂态学习方法能有效处理数据损坏问题，并通过维度缩减和聚合表示技术显著提高大规模系统的推理效率。

Abstract: Advances in leveraging Gaussian processes (GP) have enabled learning and
inferring dynamic grid behavior from scarce PMU measurements. However, real
measurements can be corrupted by various random and targeted threats, leading
to inaccurate and meaningless results. This paper develops robust transient
learning to overcome this challenge by exploiting the sparse corruption
patterns in the data flow. Specifically, we integrate sparse optimization with
method of moments (MoM) to make learning robust to a sparse distribution of
data corruptions; then, we optimize sparse weights to identify corrupted meter
locations. To improve inference speed on large-scale systems, we further adopt
K-medoid clustering of locations to develop dimension reduction (DR) and
aggregate representation (AR) heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate
robustness against random large errors, targeted false data injections, and
local PMU clock drifts. On a 1354-bus system, inference turns out to be 18x
faster using DR and 400x faster when further combined with AR heuristics.

Result: 在真实对话数据WildChat上，相比LRU，Tail-Optimized LRU实现了P90尾延迟降低27.5%，P95尾延迟降低23.9%，200ms SLO违规减少38.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际LLM部署中优化尾延迟提供了一个实用且理论上有依据的选择。

Abstract: Prompt caching is critical for reducing latency and cost in LLM inference:
OpenAI and Anthropic report up to 50-90% cost savings through prompt reuse.
Despite its widespread success, little is known about what constitutes an
optimal prompt caching policy, particularly when optimizing tail latency, a
metric of central importance to practitioners. The widely used Least Recently
Used (LRU) policy can perform arbitrarily poor on this metric, as it is
oblivious to the heterogeneity of conversation lengths. To address this gap, we
propose Tail-Optimized LRU, a simple two-line modification that reallocates KV
cache capacity to prioritize high-latency conversations by evicting cache
entries that are unlikely to affect future turns. Though the implementation is
simple, we prove its optimality under a natural stochastic model of
conversation dynamics, providing the first theoretical justification for LRU in
this setting, a result that may be of independent interest to the caching
community. Experimentally, on real conversation data WildChat, Tail-Optimized
LRU achieves up to 27.5% reduction in P90 tail Time to First Token latency and
23.9% in P95 tail latency compared to LRU, along with up to 38.9% decrease in
SLO violations of 200ms. We believe this provides a practical and theoretically
grounded option for practitioners seeking to optimize tail latency in
real-world LLM deployments.

Abstract: As connected and autonomous vehicles become more widespread, platooning has
emerged as a key strategy to improve road capacity, reduce fuel consumption,
and enhance traffic flow. However, the benefits of platoons strongly depend on
their ability to maintain stability. Instability can lead to unsafe spacing and
increased energy usage. In this work, we study platoon instability and analyze
the root cause of its occurrence, as well as its impacts on the following
vehicle. To achieve this, we propose a comparative study between different
car-following models such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), the Optimal
Velocity Model (OVM), the General Motors Model (GMM), and the Cooperative
Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC). In our approach, we introduce a disruption in
the model by varying the velocity of the leading vehicle to visualize the
behavior of the following vehicles. To evaluate the dynamic response of each
model, we introduce controlled perturbations in the velocity of the leading
vehicle, specifically, sinusoidal oscillations and discrete velocity changes.
The resulting vehicle trajectories and variations in inter-vehicle spacing are
analyzed to assess the robustness of each model to disturbance propagation. The
findings offer insight into model sensitivity, stability characteristics, and
implications for designing resilient platooning control strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个面向虚拟电厂(VPP)的量子认证聚合与结算框架，通过量子密钥分配(QKD)技术解决分布式能源资源在网络安全威胁下的安全通信问题，并优化密钥分配以最小化残余风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源和需求侧灵活性的普及，虚拟电厂在现代电网运营中变得至关重要。然而，其端到端业务流程面临着复杂的网络安全威胁和极端天气冲击，传统密码学提供有限的长期保护。量子密钥分配虽然具有信息理论安全性保证，但密钥生成率有限、路由容量不足和系统开销使得密钥分配成为紧迫挑战。

Method: 首先开发了一个系统-威胁模型，将QKD密钥生成和路由与业务层安全策略、认证强度、刷新频率和延迟约束相连接。在此基础上，制定了一个密钥预算风险最小化问题，综合考虑经济风险、服务级别违规和密钥预算可行性，并揭示了边际安全价值与影子价格之间的阈值特性。

Result: 在代表性VPP系统上的案例研究表明，所提出的方法显著降低了残余风险和服务级别协议违规，提高了密钥效率和鲁棒性，并观察到与理论影子价格机制一致的动态特性。

Conclusion: 该量子认证聚合与结算框架为虚拟电厂提供了增强的安全保护，通过优化量子密钥分配策略，在有限的密钥资源下实现了风险最小化和服务质量保证。

Abstract: The proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) and demand-side
flexibility has made virtual power plants (VPPs) central to modern grid
operation. Yet their end-to-end business pipeline, covering bidding, dispatch,
metering, settlement, and archival, forms a tightly coupled
cyber-physical-economic system where secure and timely communication is
critical. Under the combined stress of sophisticated cyberattacks and extreme
weather shocks, conventional cryptography offers limited long-term protection.
Quantum key distribution (QKD), with information-theoretic guarantees, is
viewed as a gold standard for securing critical infrastructures. However,
limited key generation rates, routing capacity, and system overhead render key
allocation a pressing challenge: scarce quantum keys must be scheduled across
heterogeneous processes to minimize residual risk while maintaining latency
guarantees. This paper introduces a quantum-authenticated aggregation and
settlement framework for VPPs. We first develop a system-threat model that
connects QKD key generation and routing with business-layer security
strategies, authentication strength, refresh frequency, and delay constraints.
Building on this, we formulate a key-budgeted risk minimization problem that
jointly accounts for economic risk, service-level violations, and key-budget
feasibility, and reveal a threshold property linking marginal security value to
shadow prices. Case studies on a representative VPP system demonstrate that the
proposed approach significantly reduces residual risk and SLA violations,
enhances key efficiency and robustness, and aligns observed dynamics with the
theoretical shadow price mechanism.

Motivation: 现代电力系统的数字化和去中心化使其通信基础设施面临日益增长的网络安全风险，特别是量子计算带来的威胁，需要评估QKD技术的应用可行性。

Method: 开发了随机系统模型，联合考虑时变密钥需求、光损耗约束下的QKD供应、站侧缓冲和后量子密码(PQC)备用机制，并制定了LCoSec和CIS两个量化指标。

Abstract: The accelerating digitalization and decentralization of modern power systems
expose critical communication infrastructures to escalating cyber risks,
particularly under emerging quantum computing threats. This paper presents an
integrated techno-economic framework to evaluate the feasibility of Quantum Key
Distribution (QKD) for secure power-system communications. A stochastic system
model is developed to jointly capture time-varying key demand, QKD supply under
optical-loss constraints, station-side buffering, and post-quantum cryptography
(PQC) fallback mechanisms. Analytical conditions are derived for service-level
assurance, including buffer stability, outage probability, and availability
bounds. Building on this, two quantitative metrics, including the Levelized
Cost of Security (LCoSec) and Cost of Incremental Security (CIS), are
formulated to unify capital, operational, and risk-related expenditures within
a discounted net-present-value framework. Using IEEE 118-bus, 123-node, and
39-bus test systems, we conduct discrete-event simulations comparing PQC-only,
QKD-only, and Hybrid architectures across multiple topologies and service
profiles. Results show that Hybrid architectures dominated by QKD significantly
reduce key-outage probability and SLA shortfalls, achieving near-unit
availability for real-time and confidentiality-critical services. Economic
analyses reveal clear breakeven zones where QKD-enhanced deployments become
cost-effective, primarily in metropolitan and distribution-level networks under
moderate optical loss and buffer sizing. The proposed framework provides a
reproducible, risk-aware decision tool for guiding large-scale, economically
justified QKD adoption in future resilient power-system infrastructures.

Abstract: In this paper, a predictive constraint-aware control scheme is formulated
within the Command Governor (CG) framework for localized hydration management
of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell system. First, a comprehensive
nonlinear dynamic model of the fuel cell system is presented which includes a
pseudo 2-dimensional (P2D) model of the stack, reactant supply and cooling
subsystems. The model captures the couplings among the various subsystems and
serves as the basis for designing output feedback controllers to track the
optimal set-points of the air supply and cooling systems for power
optimization. The closed-loop nonlinear model is then used to analyze the
dynamic behavior of membrane hydration near the anode inlet, the driest region
of the membrane in a counter-flow configuration, under various operating
conditions. A reduced-order linearized model is then derived to approximate
hydration behavior with sufficient fidelity for constraint enforcement. This
model is used within the CG framework to adjust the air supply set-points when
necessary to prevent membrane dry-out. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach in maintaining local membrane hydration while closely tracking the
requested net power is demonstrated through realistic drive-cycle simulations.

Abstract: Offshore renewable energy systems offer promising solutions for sustainable
power generation, yet most existing platforms harvest either wind or wave
energy in isolation. This study presents a hybrid floating offshore platform
that integrates a wind turbine with three oscillating surge wave energy
converters (WECs) into a hexagonal semi-submersible structure. In this
configuration, the flaps are integrated with the platform geometry to provide
both energy extraction and hydrodynamic stability. A modeling and simulation
framework was developed using WEC-Sim and benchmarked against the NREL 5 MW
semisubmersible reference. Metacentric height analysis confirmed hydrostatic
stability across a range of prescribed flap angles. Sensitivity analysis of
twelve geometric variables identified flap dimensions and tower length as
dominant drivers of stability, energy capture, and tower stress. Time-domain
simulations revealed dependence on wave incidence angle, with variations in
flap power sharing, capture width ratio (CWR), and platform response. The
feasibility of using flap sweeps to modulate pitch motion was also
demonstrated. Annual energy production (AEP) estimates based on site-specific
data indicate 16.86 GWh from wind and 3.65 GWh from wave energy, with WECs
contributing about 18% of the total. These results highlight the potential of
integrated wind-wave platforms and point toward future studies on structural
modeling and advanced control.

Abstract: With the practical implementation of connected and autonomous vehicles
(CAVs), the traffic system is expected to remain a mix of CAVs and human-driven
vehicles (HVs) for the foreseeable future. To enhance safety and traffic
efficiency, the trajectory planning strategies of CAVs must account for the
influence of HVs, necessitating accurate HV trajectory prediction. Current
research often assumes that human drivers have perfect knowledge of all
vehicles' objectives, an unrealistic premise. This paper bridges the gap by
leveraging hypergame theory to account for cognitive and perception limitations
in HVs. We model human bounded rationality without assuming them to be merely
passive followers and propose a hierarchical cognition modeling framework that
captures cognitive relationships among vehicles. We further analyze the
cognitive stability of the system, proving that the strategy profile where all
vehicles adopt cognitively equilibrium strategies constitutes a hyper Nash
equilibrium when CAVs accurately learn HV parameters. To achieve this, we
develop an inverse learning algorithm for distributed intention interpretation
via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which extends the framework to
both offline and online scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a distributed
trajectory prediction and planning approach for CAVs, leveraging the learned
parameters in real time. Simulations in highway lane-changing scenarios
demonstrate the proposed method's accuracy in parameter learning, robustness to
noisy trajectory observations, and safety in HV trajectory prediction. The
results validate the effectiveness of our method in both offline and online
implementations.

Abstract: We develop observer design over hypercomplex quaternions in a
characteristic-polynomial-free framework. Using the standard right-module
convention, we derive a right observable companion form and its companion
polynomial that encodes error dynamics via right-eigenvalue similarity classes.
The design mirrors the real/complex case - coefficient updates in companion
coordinates, followed by a similarity back - yet avoids determinants,
characteristic/minimal polynomials, and Cayley-Hamilton identities that do not
transfer to quaternions. We also give an Ackermann-type construction for the
important case of closed-loop companion polynomials with real coefficients,
ensuring similarity-equivariant evaluation. The results yield simple recipes
for full-order observers directly over quaternions, clarify the role of right
spectra and their similarity classes, and pinpoint when classical one-shot
formulas remain valid. Numerical examples illustrate the method and advantages
over vectorized or complex-adjoint surrogates.

Abstract: This paper presents a predictive control strategy to manage low-voltage
distribution systems. The proposed approach relies on an aggregate of the
flexibility at the residential unit level into a three-dimensional chart that
represents the injected active and reactive power, and the flexibility cost.
First, this method solves a multiparametric optimization problem offline at the
residential unit level to aggregate the flexibility of the assets. Then, a
semi-explicit model predictive control problem is solved to account for
forecasts. By combining the results of these problems with measurements, the
method generates the desired flexibility chart. The proposed approach is
compatible with realtime control requirements, as heavy computations are
performed offline locally, making it naturally parallelizable. By linking
realtime flexibility assessment with energy scheduling, our approach enables
efficient, low-cost, and privacy-preserving management of low-voltage
distribution systems. We validate this method on a low-voltage network of 5
buses by comparing it with an ideal technique.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲国家在净零转型和海上能源开发方面雄心勃勃，爱尔兰和英国承诺的海上风电容量远超其电力需求，但岛国的氢能潜力通常被低估。出口剩余的海上绿氢并平衡供需对欧洲碳减排至关重要。

Method: 开发自下而上的方法，考虑海上氢生产的相对成本竞争力、国内小时电力和天然气系统运行以及国际航运成本，评估未来氢/氨交易和各国在碳减排中的贡献。

Result: 海上绿氢可减少欧洲175.16 Mt/年的二氧化碳排放。英国在2030-2040年是最大的氢供应商，但在2050年被爱尔兰超越，爱尔兰向法国和西班牙出口161 TWh的氢。

Conclusion: 氢能从西向东的总体流动不仅促进欧洲的净零进展，还重塑能源供应结构，有助于确保整个欧洲大陆的能源安全。

Abstract: European countries are ambitious in both the net-zero transition and offshore
energy resource development. The Irish and UK governments announced their
commitments to offshore wind capacities - 37 and 125 GW, respectively, in 2050,
more than two times higher than their projected power demands. While other
continental countries, such as Germany, are calling for cleaner fuel resources.
Exporting surplus offshore green hydrogen and bridging supply and demand could
be pivotal in carbon emission mitigation for Europe. Yet, the potentials of
these Island countries, are usually underestimated. This paper developed a
bottom-up method to investigate the role of offshore hydrogen from Ireland and
the UK in the decarbonisation of the entire Europe. We evaluate the future
hydrogen/ammonia trading and the contributions of each country in carbon
emission mitigation, considering their relative cost-competitiveness in
offshore hydrogen production, domestic hourly power and gas system operation,
and international shipping costs. Results indicate that the offshore green
hydrogen could reduce 175.16 Mt/year of carbon dioxide emissions in Europe. The
UK will be the largest hydrogen supplier from 2030 to 2040, while surpassed by
Ireland in 2050, with 161 TWh of hydrogen exports to France and Spain. The
offshore green hydrogen can contribute to 175.16 Mt of annual carbon dioxide
emission reductions in total. This general flow of hydrogen from the West to
the East not only facilitates Europe's net-zero progress, but also reshapes the
energy supply structure and helps to ensure energy security across the European
continent.

Conclusion: 桨距调制是一种有效的噪声缓解策略，能够显著减少海上风力涡轮机的水下声学影响，同时保持可接受的能量生产水平。

Abstract: This paper proposes a pitch control strategy to mitigate the underwater
acoustic footprint of offshore wind turbines, a measure that will soon become
necessary to minimize impacts on marine life, which rely on sound for
communication, navigation, and survival. First, we quantify the underwater
acoustic signature of blade-generated aerodynamic noise from three reference
turbines, the NREL 5 MW, DTU 10 MW, and IEA 22 MW, using coupling blade element
momentum and coupled air-water acoustic propagation modeling. Second, we
propose and implement an open-loop individual pitch control (IPC) strategy that
modulates the pitch of the blade at the blade passing frequency to attenuate
the overall sound pressure level (OSPL) and the amplitude modulation (AM) of
the transmitted noise. Third, we benchmark IPC performance against conventional
pitch schemes. The results indicate that up to 5 dB reductions in OSPL and a
decrease in AM depth 20% can be achieved with a pitch variation of
$\Delta\theta\approx 5^\circ$, with small losses (5-10%) in energy capture.
These findings highlight a previously underappreciated noise pathway and
demonstrate that targeted blade-pitch modulation can mitigate its impact.

Result: 在一个枫糖浆生产中心的实际部署中，评估显示：消息飞行时间约0.1秒，命令到运动延迟2-3秒，命令完成约6秒（主要受执行器机械特性影响），操作运行时间从几十秒到几分钟不等。

Conclusion: 网络和编排开销相对于过程动态可忽略，实现了模块化分布式控制而不牺牲确定性或故障隔离。该方法降低了材料和集成成本，支持容器化部署，并自然实现边缘/云分离。

Abstract: This paper presents a practical alternative to
programmable-logic-controller-centric automation by implementing an
event-driven architecture built with industrial Internet of Things tools. A
layered design on a local edge server (i) abstracts actuators, (ii) enforces
mutual exclusion of shared physical resources through an interlock with
priority queueing, (iii) composes deterministic singular operations, and (iv)
orchestrates complete workflows as state machines in Node-RED, with
communication over MQTT. The device layer uses low-cost ESP32-based gateways to
interface sensors and actuators, while all automation logic is offloaded to the
server side. As part of a larger project involving the first
scientifically-documented integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in a maple
syrup boiling center, this work demonstrates the deployment of the proposed
system as a case-study. Evaluation over an entire production season shows
median message time of flight around one tenth of a second, command
issuance-to-motion latencies of about two to three seconds, and command
completion near six seconds dominated by actuator mechanics; operation runtimes
span tens of seconds to minutes. These results indicate that network and
orchestration overheads are negligible relative to process dynamics, enabling
modular, distributed control without compromising determinism or fault
isolation. The approach reduces material and integration effort, supports
portable containerized deployment, and naturally enables an edge/cloud split in
which persistence and analytics are offloaded while automation remains at the
edge.

### [70] [Integrating Conductor Health into Dynamic Line Rating and Unit Commitment under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15740)
*Geon Roh,Jip Kim*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种导体健康感知的机组组合(CHA-UC)模型，通过考虑动态线路额定值(DLR)下导体高温运行(ETO)的长期折旧成本，优化电力系统运行决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态线路额定值(DLR)虽然能提高现有输电线路利用率，但往往忽略了导体高温运行(ETO)对导体健康的长期影响，这会导致额外的折旧成本。

Method: 1)量化ETO相关的折旧成本；2)提出CHA-UC模型，在目标函数中整合导体温度的鲁棒线性近似和每小时ETO的预期折旧成本。

Result: 在德克萨斯123节点骨干测试系统上，使用NOAA天气数据的案例研究表明，CHA-UC相比静态线路额定值(SLR)降低了总成本0.8%，减少了可再生能源弃电84%。

Conclusion: CHA-UC通过调整机组组合实现了更安全的线路潮流，并能自适应管理风电与DLR预测误差之间的相关性，在风险对冲条件下放松潮流，在风险放大条件下收紧潮流。

Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) enables greater utilization of existing
transmission lines by leveraging real-time weather data. However, the elevated
temperature operation (ETO) of conductors under DLR is often overlooked,
despite its long-term impact on conductor health. This paper addresses this
issue by 1) quantifying depreciation costs associated with ETO and 2) proposing
a Conductor Health-Aware Unit Commitment (CHA-UC) that internalizes these costs
in operational decisions. The CHA-UC incorporates a robust linear approximation
of conductor temperature and integration of expected depreciation costs due to
hourly ETO into the objective function. Case studies on the Texas 123-bus
backbone test system using NOAA weather data demonstrate that the proposed
CHA-UC model reduces the total cost by 0.8% and renewable curtailment by
84%compared to static line rating (SLR), while conventional DLR operation
without risk consideration resulted in higher costs due to excessive ETO.
Further analysis of the commitment decisions and the line temperature
statistics confirms that the CHA-UC achieves safer line flows by shifting
generator commitments. Finally, we examine the emergent correlation between
wind generation and DLR forecast errors, and show that CHA-UC adaptively
manages this effect by relaxing flows for risk-hedging conditions while
tightening flows for risk-amplifying ones.

TL;DR: 提出了一种安全关键控制框架，用于在不对称路面上制动时保持车辆横向运动的边界，防止车辆失控旋转，同时最小化制动距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车辆在不对称路面制动时的安全控制问题，防止因制动导致的过度横向运动（如旋转失控），同时考虑制动力的输入约束。

Method: 使用备份控制屏障函数进行安全控制设计，提出基于反馈线性化和连续时间Lyapunov方程的系统性方法来构建有效的备份集-备份控制器对。

Result: 通过简单示例验证了所提出的安全关键控制方法，并在四轮车辆模型上实现了不对称路面制动控制，展示了仿真结果。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效保证车辆在不对称路面制动时的安全性，防止横向失控，同时优化制动性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a safety-critical control framework to maintain bounded
lateral motions for vehicles braking on asymmetric surfaces. We synthesize a
brake controller that assists drivers and guarantees safety against excessive
lateral motions (i.e., prevents the vehicle from spinning out) while minimizing
the stopping distance. We address this safety-critical control problem in the
presence of input constraints, since braking forces are limited by the
available friction on the road. We use backup control barrier functions for
safe control design. As this approach requires the construction of a backup set
and a backup controller, we propose a novel, systematic method to creating
valid backup set-backup controller pairs based on feedback linearization and
continuous-time Lyapunov equations. We use simple examples to demonstrate our
proposed safety-critical control method. Finally, we implement our approach on
a four-wheel vehicle model for braking on asymmetric surfaces and present
simulation results.

Conclusion: 感觉运动门控机制为设计自保护、自适应和韧性微电网提供了有前景的框架，未来需要在门控数学建模、数字孪生验证和跨学科合作等方面进一步研究。

Abstract: Microgrids are emerging as key enablers of resilient, sustainable, and
intelligent power systems, but they continue to face challenges in dynamic
disturbance handling, protection coordination, and uncertainty. Recent efforts
have explored Brain Emotional Learning (BEL) controllers as bio-inspired
solutions for microgrid control. Building on this growing trajectory, this
article introduces a new paradigm for Neuro-Microgrids, inspired by the brain's
sensorimotor gating mechanisms, specifically the Prepulse Inhibition (PPI) and
Prepulse Facilitation (PPF). Sensorimotor gating offers a biological model for
selectively suppressing or amplifying responses depending on contextual
relevance. By mapping these principles onto the hierarchical control
architecture of microgrids, we propose a Sensorimotor Gating-Inspired
Neuro-Microgrid (SG-NMG) framework. In this architecture, PPI-like control
decisions correspond to protective damping in primary and secondary management
of microgrids, whereas PPF-like decisions correspond to adaptive amplification
of corrective control actions. The framework is presented through analytical
workflow design, neuro-circuitry analogies, and integration with machine
learning methods. Finally, open challenges and research directions are
outlined, including the mathematical modeling of gating, digital twin
validation, and cross-disciplinary collaboration between neuroscience and
industrial power systems. The resulting paradigm highlights sensorimotor gating
as a promising framework for designing self-protective, adaptive, and resilient
microgrids.

### [73] [OpenEstimate: Evaluating LLMs on Reasoning Under Uncertainty with Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15096)
*Alana Renda,Jillian Ross,Michael Cafarella,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenEstimate是一个用于评估语言模型在不确定性下进行数值估计任务的多领域基准测试，发现前沿语言模型的概率先验通常不准确且过度自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中语言模型需要在信息不完整的情况下进行不确定性推理，但现有评估主要关注有明确答案的问题，缺乏对不确定性推理能力的评估。

Method: 开发了OpenEstimate基准测试，通过数值估计任务评估语言模型，要求模型综合背景信息并以概率先验形式表达预测，评估其准确性和校准度。

Result: 六个前沿语言模型的概率先验通常不准确且过度自信，性能仅随不确定性提取方式略有改善，但不受采样策略、推理努力或提示设计变化的影响。

Conclusion: OpenEstimate为前沿语言模型提供了具有挑战性的评估平台，有助于开发更好的概率估计和不确定性推理模型。

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

Motivation: 程序化内容生成在游戏开发中越来越受欢迎，但传统方法缺乏智能性和适应性。本研究旨在探索深度强化学习在游戏关卡设计中的潜力，实现更智能、动态的内容生成。

Method: 使用Unity ML-Agents工具包，训练两个PPO智能体：蜂鸟智能体作为解决者学习导航和收集花朵，浮岛智能体学习基于障碍物位置和蜂鸟性能反馈生成花朵布局。

Result: 该方法产生了有效的智能体行为，并在各种环境配置中展现出强大的泛化能力，证明了深度强化学习在自主游戏关卡设计中的可行性。

Conclusion: 这项工作突出了深度强化学习在虚拟环境中实现智能体生成和解决内容的潜力，为AI在创意游戏开发过程中的贡献开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

TL;DR: 本文认为AGI进展受理论限制而非数据或规模限制，挑战柏拉图表示假说，提出因果力学框架，强调假设空间变化作为首要操作，通过结构原则使错误发现和修正变得可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI发展面临理论瓶颈，观测等价的世界在干预下可能分化，仅靠观测充分性无法保证干预能力，需要转向以错误为中心的范式。

Method: 提出因果力学框架，将假设空间变化作为首要操作，使用概率结构但不预设其存在，引入局部性、自主性、独立因果机制和组合自主性等结构原则。

Result: 建立了使错误发现和修正可行的理论框架，提供了将不可达错误转化为可达错误并修正的脚手架。

Conclusion: AGI进展需要理论突破，因果力学框架通过强调假设空间变化和错误修正机制，为解决理论限制提供了新方向。

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型主要模拟群体共识，缺乏对个体推理风格和信念轨迹的捕捉，需要开发能更好模拟人类个体推理的AI系统。

Method: 采用双轨设计：合成轨道用于大规模系统压力测试，人类轨道收集生态有效的"出声思考"推理数据，评估模型对个体推理演化的捕捉能力。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLM在个体推理适应方面仍存在持续差距，HugAgent成为首个可扩展的基准来对齐机器推理与人类思维的个体性。

Conclusion: HugAgent为推进机器推理更接近人类个体思维提供了首个可扩展的评估基准，有助于缩小AI与人类推理之间的差距。

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as
HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking

Motivation: 解决真实工作环境中情绪识别面临的挑战，特别是缺乏大规模、长期的自然环境数据集的问题。

Method: 使用深度学习面部表情识别技术收集数据，计算情绪概率和32个扩展情绪指标，包括效价、唤醒度、波动性等。

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,
emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

Motivation: 当前AGI评估使用对称权重和快照测试，无法区分持久能力与脆弱表现，且忽视了不同认知领域的重要性差异。

Method: 提出中心性优先分数（使用CHC理论权重）和集群稳定性指数系列，评估能力在延迟、压力下的持久性、学习保持和错误纠正能力。

Result: 这些扩展保持了多领域广度，同时减少了评估的脆弱性和被操控的可能性。

Conclusion: 通用智能应被视为稳态属性集群，评估需关注能力在扰动下的共同保持机制，并提供了可实施的测试协议。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

Motivation: 现有软件大多缺乏可访问的API，智能体只能通过像素级GUI进行操作。在这种无API环境下，基于LLM的智能体面临严重效率瓶颈：局限于局部视觉体验，做出短视决策，依赖低效的试错方法，阻碍技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 提出KG-Agent框架，将原始像素级交互构建为持久的状态-动作知识图(SA-KG)，连接功能相似但视觉不同的GUI状态。设计基于图拓扑的混合内在奖励机制，结合状态价值奖励和探索新颖性奖励，将战略规划与纯发现解耦。

Result: 在Civilization V和Slay the Spire两个复杂的开放式GUI决策环境中进行评估，相比最先进方法，在探索效率和战略深度方面展现出显著改进。

Conclusion: KG-Agent通过结构化经验表示和混合奖励机制，有效解决了无API环境中智能体的探索效率和长期规划问题，为GUI交互智能体提供了更有效的学习框架。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Conclusion: WebGen-V是首个实现高粒度代理爬取和评估的指令到HTML生成工作，提供了从真实数据采集到结构化多模态评估的统一流程。

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and
multimodal understanding, we present WebGen-V, a new benchmark and framework
for instruction-to-HTML generation that enhances both data quality and
evaluation granularity. WebGen-V contributes three key innovations: (1) an
unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and
webpage generation to structured multimodal assessment.

TL;DR: VERITAS是一个通过整合视觉先验和多模态模型来提升监督微调数据质量的流水线，能有效减少事实错误和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型的监督微调数据存在事实错误和幻觉问题，主要由于视觉感知不足导致。

Method: 利用视觉识别模型和OCR系统提取结构化视觉先验，结合多个先进LMM评估原始答案，通过统计融合得到高置信度共识分数作为真实标签，训练轻量级批评模型，最终选择得分最高的精炼答案。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，使用VERITAS处理数据微调的模型性能优于使用原始数据的模型，尤其在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: VERITAS能有效提升多模态模型的数据质量和推理能力，同时批评模型在保持高效的同时具备与先进LMM相当的能力。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

TL;DR: DEPO是一个新的强化学习框架，旨在减少大型推理模型中的低效推理，通过优势解耦算法、难度感知长度惩罚和优势裁剪方法，显著缩短响应长度并减少过度推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习算法虽然提高了模型准确性，但存在响应过长和过度推理的问题，导致推理延迟和计算消耗增加，特别是在简单任务中。

Method: DEPO框架包含三个核心组件：优势解耦算法指导模型减少低效token；难度感知长度惩罚降低整体响应长度；优势裁剪方法防止策略优化偏差。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B和1.5B模型上，DEPO将序列长度减少39%，减少了低效token中的过度推理路径，同时在整体准确性上优于基础模型。

Conclusion: DEPO有效解决了大型推理模型中的低效推理问题，在保持准确性的同时显著降低了计算消耗和推理延迟。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Method: 使用强化学习和关系图卷积神经网络开发自动布局引擎，结合增加的网格分辨率和精确的引脚信息集成，以及动态布线资源估计技术，平衡布线效率和面积效率。

Result: 在模拟环境中，相比过去基于学习的最先进技术，该方法实现了死区面积减少13.8%、线长减少40.6%、布线成功率提高73.4%。

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: 本文提出了可修正性的正式定义，并介绍了一种转换方法，可将任何目标转换为可修正版本而不牺牲性能，通过条件奖励预测实现训练过程中的安全更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI训练过程中，部分学习的目标往往会激励AI避免进一步的目标更新，因为大多数目标通过持续追求能更好地实现。可修正性允许纠正错误和适应人类偏好变化，是重要的安全属性。

Method: 引入一个转换方法，通过短视地获取条件奖励预测来构建可修正目标版本，该方法可递归扩展到新创建的代理，并防止代理故意修改其目标。

Result: 两个网格世界实验证明，这些可修正目标可以有效学习，并产生期望的行为。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够创建既具有竞争力又具有可修正性的目标，解决了现有文献中缺乏此类规范的问题，为AI安全提供了重要保障。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习在单智能体推理任务中有效，但在多轮次、多智能体场景中的扩展仍未被充分探索，主要挑战包括长期信用分配和智能体特定的优势估计。

Method: MARS框架包含回合级优势估计器用于信用分配，以及智能体特定的优势归一化来稳定多智能体训练，通过自博弈在合作和竞争游戏中学习。

Conclusion: 在策略游戏中通过自博弈进行端到端RL训练是开发LLM可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code

Conclusion: Adaptive Minds提供了一个可扩展和可扩展的领域自适应AI助手基础，完全开源，结合了灵活性和效率的优势。

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as
domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single fine-tuned model or rigid
rule-based routing, our approach empowers the base LLM itself to act as a
semantic router analyzing each query and dynamically selecting the most
relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent
orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive
Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational
ability. The system is built with LangGraph for workflow management, supports
both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and
extensible foundation for domain-adaptive AI assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临判断不一致性问题，这会破坏强化学习的稳定性。虽然之前研究关注判断准确性，但逻辑一致性特别是偏好循环等关键问题尚未得到充分解决。

Method: 引入包含两个主要贡献的框架：CDR指标量化判断冲突，DGR框架通过构建偏好图、转换为无冲突有向无环图，在策略优化前去除循环来净化信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架相比强基线显著提升了训练稳定性和模型性能。

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性已成为AI反馈中关键且可管理的重要维度。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉复杂多模态信号关系，局限于单模态数据或单一故障类型，且在噪声或跨域条件下性能下降。需要开发能够同时诊断轴承、定子和转子故障的鲁棒诊断方案。

Method: 首次将对比学习集成到专门为多模态传感器融合设计的超图拓扑中，联合建模模态内和模态间依赖关系，超越欧几里得嵌入空间增强泛化能力。

Result: 在三个真实基准测试中达到99.82%准确率，表现出强跨域泛化能力和噪声鲁棒性，消融研究验证了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: MM-HCAN为全面多故障诊断提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，支持工业环境中的预测性维护和资产寿命延长。

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

TL;DR: JudgeSQL是一个通过结构化推理和加权共识锦标赛机制重新定义SQL候选选择的框架，解决了在测试时扩展中选择正确查询的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到SQL任务存在语义模糊性和复杂组合推理的挑战，现有选择方法（如自一致性或最佳N解码）只能提供浅层信号，容易导致不一致评分、脆弱推理链和无法捕捉细粒度语义差异。

Method: 开发基于推理的SQL判断模型，通过强化学习在可验证奖励指导下提炼推理轨迹；采用加权共识锦标赛机制，整合显式推理偏好和隐式生成器置信度。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，JudgeSQL展现出卓越的SQL判断能力、良好的跨尺度泛化能力以及对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL通过结构化推理和加权共识机制，为SQL候选选择提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案，显著提升了文本到SQL任务的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学中的时间背景对于评估患者健康状况随时间变化很有价值，特别是在历史就诊次数有限且频率不定的情况下。

Method: 模型首先使用最近一次就诊的医疗数据估计疾病初始风险，然后利用先前收集的影像和/或临床生物标志物信息来完善评估。

Result: 整合历史背景将假阳性转化为真阴性，假阳性率从51%逐步降低到24%（整合最多三次先前影像检查），预测五年内前列腺癌风险的假阳性率从64%降至9%。

Conclusion: 随时间收集的信息提供了相关背景，可增强医学风险预测的特异性，为扩展纵向健康监测项目提供可能，实现更早检测和改善健康结果。

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的科学助手铺平了道路，能够将知识与实验执行相连接。

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Result: 建立了生成模型对齐中公平性和个性化的理论和算法框架，确保从有限用户数据和无限用户中识别潜在用户偏好。

Conclusion: 通过引入排序数据和异质偏好处理机制，为生成模型对齐提供了更公平和个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator

Motivation: 需要标准化评估发票信息提取的准确性，以便比较不同提取方法并发现各字段提取的优缺点。

Method: 使用Docling和LlamaCloud服务对扫描或数字发票进行预处理，识别并提取关键字段（发票号码、日期、总金额、供应商详情等）。

Result: 建立了包含字段级精度、一致性检查失败率和完全匹配准确率的稳健评估框架。

Conclusion: 提出的评估指标为比较不同提取方法提供了标准化方式，并能突出显示字段特定性能的强弱项。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for extracting structured information from
invoice documents and proposes a set of evaluation metrics (EM) to assess the
accuracy of the extracted data against annotated ground truth. The approach
involves pre-processing scanned or digital invoices, applying Docling and
LlamaCloud Services to identify and extract key fields such as invoice number,
date, total amount, and vendor details. To ensure the reliability of the
extraction process, we establish a robust evaluation framework comprising
field-level precision, consistency check failures, and exact match accuracy.
The proposed metrics provide a standardized way to compare different extraction
methods and highlight strengths and weaknesses in field-specific performance.

Abstract: As autonomous agentic AI systems see increasing adoption across
organisations, persistent challenges in alignment, governance, and risk
management threaten to impede deployment at scale. We present AURA (Agent
aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify,
and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and
practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology
that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and
practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score,
evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,
synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)
communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic
systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with
established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and
transparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and
mitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a
critical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise
environments.

TL;DR: 提出首个将帕金森病评估中的多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题的系统TRIP，解决了传统多模态方法在训练时需要同步所有模态、推理时依赖所有模态的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态方法存在两个主要限制：训练时需要同步所有模态，推理时依赖所有模态，这阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 将多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题，引入基于边界的类别重平衡策略来处理模态内不平衡问题。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，TRIP在异步设置下比最佳基线方法提升了16.48、6.89和11.55个百分点，在同步设置下提升了4.86和2.30个百分点。

Conclusion: TRIP框架在帕金森病评估中实现了最先进的性能，具有有效性和适应性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

TL;DR: Dialectica框架通过结构化对话、记忆和自我反思机制，让AI代理在复杂问题中发展专业知识，实验证明该方法能显著提升代理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多维度问题（如司法框架、环境污染等）时，现有LLM缺乏通过经验发展专业知识的内生机制，需要新的方法来提升AI在这些开放不可验证领域的能力。

Method: 提出Dialectica框架，让代理在定义的主题上进行结构化对话，增强记忆、自我反思和政策约束的上下文编辑功能，将讨论视为隐式元强化学习过程。

Result: 实验显示，在两种模型架构上，启用基于反思的上下文编辑的代理在Elo评分、标准化Bradley-Terry-Davidson能力和AlphaRank质量上均优于基线版本。

Conclusion: 对话驱动的上下文演化是实现在开放不可验证领域中针对性专业知识放大的可行路径，定性和定量证据一致支持这一结论。

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Result: 结合临床指南和高质量系统评价的RAG配置在各方面表现最优，既优于狭窄的单一指南方法，也优于大规模文献数据库。

Conclusion: 对于新兴疾病，基于精选二次评价的检索在狭窄共识文档和未过滤原始文献之间提供了最佳平衡，支持临床决策同时避免信息过载和过度简化指导。

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可持续能源发展增加了电网负荷的不确定性，输电系统运营商需要更高空间分辨率的负荷预测，从区域级扩展到节点级，但节点负荷预测准确性较低且管理困难。

Method: 设计多级预测系统，使用可解释且可扩展的预测模型，通过完全并行化的单模型预测工作流，逐步将区域运营扩展到节点预测。

Result: 区域预测的准确性和可解释性得到改善，节点预测有显著提升，运营商能够以前所未有的信心和准确性调整预测，并精确诊断错误。

Conclusion: 多级预测系统成功解决了节点负荷预测的挑战，为电网运营商提供了更可靠、可管理的负荷预测工具。

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

TL;DR: 提出了TangledFeatures框架，用于在相关特征空间中进行特征选择，通过识别纠缠预测变量组中的代表性特征来减少冗余同时保留解释力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法主要关注预测准确性，在存在相关预测变量的情况下性能会下降，需要一种能够处理相关特征空间的方法。

Method: TangledFeatures框架识别相关预测变量组中的代表性特征，形成特征子集可直接应用于下游模型。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide数据集上应用该框架预测主链扭转角，所选特征对应于结构上有意义的原子间距离，能够解释这些角度的变化。

Conclusion: TangledFeatures提供比传统选择技术更可解释和稳定的分析基础，在相关特征空间中表现有效。

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

*Rijul Tandon,Peter Vamplew,Cameron Foale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ES-C51算法，用Expected Sarsa更新替换C51中的贪婪Q学习更新，通过softmax结合所有动作信息，解决了当动作具有相似期望奖励时分布学习不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于值的RL算法只估计期望奖励，而分布强化学习估计整个奖励分布。C51在离散动作空间中很流行，但当多个动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时，贪婪更新会导致分布学习不稳定。

Method: 修改C51算法，用Expected Sarsa更新替换贪婪Q学习更新，使用softmax计算结合所有可能动作的信息，而不是依赖单一最佳动作。同时将标准C51的探索策略从ε-greedy改为softmax作为对比基线。

Result: 在Gym经典控制环境和Atari-10游戏中评估，ES-C51在多数环境中优于QL-C51（修改后的标准C51）。

Conclusion: ES-C51通过Expected Sarsa更新有效解决了动作具有相似期望奖励时的分布学习不稳定问题，能够学习到性能更高的策略。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机效用模型(RUMs)在人类反馈强化学习中很重要，但许多技术依赖不相关的替代品独立性(IIA)假设，这过度简化了人类偏好的多样性。避免这一假设的模型缺乏统计和计算保证。

Method: 研究相关probit模型的学习挑战，分析不同数据收集范式（成对偏好vs三选一偏好）的有效性，并开发统计和计算高效的估计算法。

Result: 证明成对偏好数据本质上不足以学习相关性信息，而三选一偏好数据能够克服这一限制，提出的算法在多个真实数据集上验证了改进的人类偏好个性化效果。

Conclusion: 高阶偏好数据在相关效用学习中具有显著优势，能够实现更细粒度的人类偏好建模，为个性化偏好建模提供了理论基础和实践方法。

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

Result: 在两个真实信用数据集上评估，IQNN-CS表现出稳定的训练动态、有竞争力的预测性能和增强的可解释性。

Conclusion: 为金融决策提供了透明和可问责的QML模型的实用路径。

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a
practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial
decision-making.

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和Sudoku等多样化环境中显著提升性能：Sokoban成功率从25.6%提升至59.8%，FrozenLake得分从22.1%提升至70.9%

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体配备内部世界模型能更好地对齐推理与环境动态，改善决策能力，SPA框架有效提升了RL智能体训练性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

*Ziqing Lu,Babak Hassibi,Lifeng Lai,Weiyu Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出多层级可配置时变马尔可夫决策过程（MCTVMDP），允许智能体通过上层模型改变动作主动修改环境动态，而不仅是被动适应固定环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习假设环境固定不变，但实际中智能体可能通过主动改变环境动态来获得更高奖励。

Method: 构建双层MDP框架：下层MDP具有可配置的非平稳转移函数，通过上层模型改变动作进行配置；智能体需要联合优化上层配置策略和下层原始动作策略。

Result: 提出了MCTVMDP框架，使智能体能够主动修改环境动态以最大化长期奖励。

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了传统RL的被动适应范式，为智能体提供了主动改造环境的能力，有望在需要环境配置的场景中带来性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Antislop框架通过采样器、自动化流水线和FTPO微调方法，有效检测和消除LLM输出中的重复短语模式，在保持性能的同时显著减少AI文本特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM广泛采用导致输出中出现特征性的重复短语模式（称为"slop"），这降低了输出质量并使AI生成文本容易被识别。

Method: 结合三种创新方法：Antislop采样器使用回溯抑制不需要的字符串；自动化流水线分析模型特定slop并生成训练数据；FTPO微调方法在单个token级别调整logits。

Result: 成功抑制8000+模式，而token禁止在2000模式时就不可用；FTPO实现90% slop减少，同时在GSM8K、MMLU和创意写作任务中保持或改善性能。

Conclusion: Antislop框架能有效减少LLM输出中的重复模式，提高文本质量，而DPO方法会导致写作质量和词汇多样性显著下降。

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种基于物理信息数据驱动预测模型和统计方法的双光子光刻系统健康监测方法，能够准确及时地监控机器健康状况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前双光子光刻系统的维护主要依赖经验而非基于机器健康状态的监测，导致维护不及时或过度维护的问题。

Method: 结合物理信息数据驱动预测模型和统计方法，提出了三种能够处理不同泛化能力水平的复杂场景的健康监测方法。

Result: 在包含六种工艺参数组合和六种结构尺寸的全面实验数据集上测试，所有方法都实现了高精度，表现出优异的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这些结果为双光子光刻系统实现基于状态的维护迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

*Sami Davies,Benjamin Moseley,Heather Newman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次在在线设置中实现了同时逼近所有ℓp范数的聚类算法，在AOS模型中通过少量样本输入，实现了对ℓ1范数O(1)竞争比、ℓ∞范数O(log n)竞争比以及所有ℓp范数O(log⁴ n)竞争比的高概率保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于ℓp范数目标在相关性聚类中的基本权衡：ℓ1范数最小化总分歧，ℓ∞范数确保对单个节点的公平性。虽然离线设置中可以实现同时逼近所有范数，但在线设置中是否可行尚不清楚。

Method: 提出了在线带样本(AOS)模型中的单一算法，利用输入的一小部分常数比例作为样本，生成一个聚类，同时为所有ℓp范数提供竞争性保证。

Result: 算法在AOS模型中实现了：对ℓ1范数O(1)竞争比(期望值)，对ℓ∞范数O(log n)竞争比(高概率)，对所有ℓp范数O(log⁴ n)竞争比(高概率)。同时证明了在标准随机顺序在线模型中，ℓ∞范数需要至少Ω(n¹/³)竞争比。

Conclusion: 成功将离线"全范数"保证迁移到在线世界，证明了AOS模型在克服标准在线模型局限性方面的必要性，并为ℓ1和ℓ∞范数的竞争比提供了接近紧的下界。

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归和扩散方法在长期物理一致性预测中存在累积误差和离散化伪影问题，流匹配提供了一种高效的确定性采样替代方案。

Method: 提出TempO模型，采用潜在流匹配和稀疏条件，通过通道折叠处理3D时空场，使用时变傅里叶层捕捉多尺度模式。

Result: 在三个基准PDE数据集上优于最先进基线，谱分析显示能更好地恢复多尺度动力学，效率研究表明其参数和内存需求低于基于注意力或卷积的回归器。

Conclusion: TempO通过流匹配和傅里叶层有效解决了高维PDE动力学预测问题，在精度和效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge
for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches
often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to
attention-based or convolutional regressors.

TL;DR: DLER通过改进RL优化方法解决推理语言模型输出过长问题，使用简单的截断长度惩罚，结合批量奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样等技术，在保持准确率的同时大幅缩短输出长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理语言模型（如OpenAI-o1、DeepSeek-R1、Qwen）虽然性能强大，但生成了不必要的冗长输出，如何在保持准确率的同时最大化每个token的智能度是一个开放性问题。

Method: 提出DLER训练方法，使用简单的截断长度惩罚，结合批量奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样等技术，解决RL优化中的三个关键挑战：优势估计偏差大、熵崩溃和稀疏奖励信号。

Result: DLER将输出长度减少超过70%，同时超越了所有先前基线的准确率。DLER-7B相比DeepSeek-R1-7B，在并行生成多个简洁响应时准确率提高28%，延迟更低。

Conclusion: DLER实现了最先进的准确率-效率权衡，证明了通过改进RL优化而非复杂惩罚机制可以有效解决输出冗长问题。还提出了难度感知DLER和更新选择性合并方法以进一步提升效率。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Conclusion: 该框架是迈向机械通气优化和个性化治疗的重要一步，可模拟MV决策效果并指导临床实践。

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图拉普拉斯算子的非参数概率质量函数估计方法，通过数据依赖的低通滤波处理多模态和重尾分布，计算高效且无需过多调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大离散支撑集上多模态和重尾概率质量函数的非参数估计问题，传统方法在处理噪声和保持粗粒度结构方面存在挑战。

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图上的信号，构建对称三对角算子（路径图拉普拉斯加上经验PMF构建的对角矩阵），计算最小特征值对应的特征向量，将经验PMF投影到低维子空间进行平滑估计。

Result: 在合成和真实重尾数据上，该方法能有效保持粗粒度结构同时抑制采样噪声，在目标场景下优于logspline和高斯KDE基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简洁、计算可靠、内存效率高，适合自动化流水线和大规模探索性分析，但存在已知失效模式（如突然不连续性）。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

Result: BiLSTM在测试集上获得RMSE 6.38，优于LSTM-Attention(9.19，提升30.6%)和线性滞后回归基线(提升35.4% RMSE)，在MAE和MAPE指标上也有并行改进。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使用长历史数据训练的模型泛化能力最好，适中的回看窗口(20-30周)提供强上下文，双向编码对捕捉窗口内的积累和后续模式至关重要，短期结构特征贡献最大。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Conclusion: 该均值场理论为理解有限宽度神经网络中的特征学习提供了机制性见解，揭示了自强化输入特征选择在特征学习中的关键作用。

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

Motivation: 虽然优化代理在平均情况下能达到高精度，但最坏情况下的最优性差距可能很大，难以在实际中信任预测结果。需要在经典求解器和优化代理之间找到平衡，实现可信部署。

Method: 提出混合求解器，利用对偶理论高效地界定预测的最优性差距边界；提出结合原始和对偶代理训练的替代训练过程；在无法认证最优性时回退到经典求解器。

Result: 在大规模输电系统上的实验表明，混合求解器具有高度可扩展性，相比并行化单纯形求解器实现了超过1000倍的加速，同时保证最大最优性差距不超过2%。

Conclusion: 该混合求解器成功地在优化代理和经典求解器之间实现了平衡，提供了可解释的速度-最优性权衡，能够保证用户定义的最优性阈值，实现了可信的实际部署。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段模型，结合临床和影像学信息来提高髋部骨折风险预测的准确性，相比传统方法具有更高敏感性和更少的漏诊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前常用的DXA T评分和FRAX工具在髋部骨折风险评估中缺乏敏感性，特别是对于无既往骨折史或骨量减少的高风险人群容易漏诊。

Method: 采用顺序两阶段模型：第一阶段使用临床、人口统计学和功能变量进行筛查，第二阶段结合DXA影像特征进行精炼预测。基于MrOS、SOF和UK Biobank数据集开发。

Result: 经过内部和外部验证，该模型在不同队列中表现一致且适应性强。相比T评分和FRAX，两阶段框架实现了更高的敏感性和更少的漏诊病例。

Conclusion: 该两阶段模型提供了一种成本效益高且个性化的早期髋部骨折风险评估方法，能够更准确地识别高风险个体。

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

Motivation: 传统的高保真有限元仿真计算成本高、耗时，需要开发更高效的碰撞安全性评估方法。

Method: 使用MeshGraphNet和Transolver神经网络架构，结合时间条件、标准自回归和稳定性增强自回归三种策略，基于150个LS-DYNA有限元仿真数据集进行训练。

Result: 模型能够合理捕捉整体变形趋势，计算成本降低数个数量级，但尚未达到完整有限元仿真的精度水平。

Conclusion: 机器学习在结构碰撞动力学中的应用具有可行性，能够实现快速设计探索和早期优化，尽管精度仍需提升。

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过实证研究发现马氏距离方法在OOD检测中并非普遍可靠，定义了理想的数据表示几何结构，并提出径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法来显著提升OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然马氏距离方法在OOD检测中被广泛使用，但表示几何和归一化对其性能的影响尚未被充分理解，这可能限制其下游应用。

Method: 进行了全面的实证研究，涵盖多种图像基础模型、数据集和距离归一化方案；提出了径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法，通过可调参数直接控制特征空间的径向几何结构。

Result: 分析表明马氏距离方法并非普遍可靠；谱和内在维度指标能准确预测模型的OOD性能；径向缩放归一化能显著提升OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过弥合表示几何、归一化和OOD性能之间的差距，为设计更有效可靠的深度学习模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ReasonIF基准来评估大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令的能力，发现当前模型存在严重缺陷，并探索了多轮推理和指令微调两种改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究评估模型主要回复的指令遵循能力，但推理过程中的指令遵循对模型可控性、透明性和安全性同样至关重要，需要专门评估。

Method: 构建ReasonIF基准，包含多语言推理、格式控制和长度控制等6类指令提示；测试多个开源LRM；探索多轮推理和推理指令微调(RIF)两种改进策略。

Result: 当前模型推理指令遵循能力严重不足：最高IFS得分低于0.25；任务难度增加时表现进一步下降；RIF方法将GPT-OSS-20B的IFS从0.11提升至0.27。

Conclusion: 推理指令遵循是LRM的重要能力维度，现有模型表现不佳，RIF方法虽有改进但仍有很大提升空间，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

*Zhiyuan Fan,Yifeng Liu,Qingyue Zhao,Angela Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对AdamW优化器的权重衰减缩放规则，解决了在尺度不变架构中μP方法在训练后期失效的问题，实现了学习率和权重衰减在不同宽度模型间的零样本迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在尺度不变架构中，训练很快进入优化器主导的稳态，归一化层导致反向传播尺度敏感性，使得有效学习率变得宽度依赖，从而破坏了μP方法的学习率迁移能力。

Method: 引入权重衰减缩放规则λ₂∝√d，结合矩阵参数的学习率规则η₂∝d⁻¹和向量参数的学习率η₁=Θ_d(1)、λ₁=0，保持子层增益在不同宽度下的不变性。

Result: 在LLaMA风格Transformer和最小合成设置中验证了该规则的有效性，实现了学习率和权重衰减在不同宽度模型间的零样本迁移，无需为每个宽度单独调整超参数。

Conclusion: 通过显式控制优化器设定的稳态尺度，将μP方法扩展到近初始化阶段之外，为AdamW下的宽度鲁棒超参数迁移提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

*Xuansheng Wu,Xiaoman Pan,Wenlin Yao,Jianshu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究发现，不同基础模型在强化学习可验证奖励（RLVR）后的推理性能差异源于模型对知识正确性的内在感知能力。通过引入正确性感知水平（SAL）这一微观指标，揭示了模型推理潜力与其预训练时区分正确与错误知识的内在能力密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同基础模型在RLVR强化学习后的推理性能差异很大，研究者希望探究这种差异背后的微观机制，了解预训练模型的哪些内在属性导致了这种变化。

Method: 将推理形式化为Horn子句链，使用跨层稀疏自编码器从LLM潜在空间提取特征，估计特征间的转移概率，并用LLM对每条规则按语义正确性水平进行分类，最后引入SAL指标来量化不同正确性水平下概率分布的分离程度。

Result: 发现高性能模型具有内在的正确性感知能力，其内部概率分布在不同的正确性水平下系统性变化，特别是"严格"与"噪声"规则间差异显著；而弱模型则对正确性不敏感。SAL指标能准确预测模型在RLVR后的推理性能（R^2=0.87）。

Conclusion: 模型的推理潜力与其预训练时内在区分正确与错误知识的能力紧密相关，这强调了模型预训练在塑造推理能力中的关键作用，并为选择和设计更强的基础模型提供了基于内部机制的实际指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

Motivation: 潜变量能量模型能够表达生成建模并捕捉隐藏结构，但传统训练方法存在局限性。本文旨在开发无需判别器或辅助网络的高效训练算法。

Method: 将最大似然训练重新表述为鞍点问题，通过耦合的Wasserstein梯度流进行优化，交替使用过阻尼Langevin更新和随机参数上升。

Result: 在标准平滑性和耗散性假设下证明了算法的存在性和收敛性，在KL散度和Wasserstein-2距离上获得衰减率，且ELBO比受限摊销后验获得的边界更严格。

Conclusion: 该方法在物理系统数值近似上表现良好，与可比方法竞争性相当，为潜变量能量模型提供了有效的训练框架。

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设演示者属于低复杂度策略类，但本文认为奖励模型属于低基数类是一个更弱的假设。当存在多个正确答案时，最大似然估计可能失败。

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文强盗中的离线模仿学习，基于奖励模型在低基数类中的假设，设计了一种样本复杂度与奖励类基数对数相关的新方法。

Result: 证明了最大似然估计方法在这种情况下可能失败，而提出的新方法能够以对数样本复杂度学习。

Conclusion: 当从正确演示中学习时，需要超越传统的似然最大化方法，特别是在奖励模型属于低基数类的情况下。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

*Shiqin Tang,Rong Feng,Shuxin Zhuang,Hongzong Li,Youzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于信息论的因果推断方法，通过最小化表示与处理变量之间的互信息来消除分配偏差，无需对抗训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因果推断中的分配偏差问题，传统对抗训练方法存在不稳定性和调参负担，需要更稳定且理论完备的方法。

Method: 学习随机表示Z来预测结果，同时最小化I(Z;T)，推导出可处理的变分目标上界信息项，并与监督解码器耦合。

Result: 在数值模拟和真实临床数据集上评估，在似然度、反事实误差和政策评估等指标上表现优于现有方法，避免了对抗训练的不稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的信息论方法能有效消除处理-协变量依赖关系，在因果推断任务中表现优异且训练稳定。

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

Motivation: 扩展先前关于使用乘积系数增强3D LiDAR点云分类的研究，探索结合自编码器表示是否能进一步提升性能。

Method: 将乘积系数与自编码器表示相结合，使用KNN分类器，并逐级添加乘积系数来研究其对分类性能的影响。

Result: 逐级添加乘积系数显示出明显趋势：更丰富的系数集合系统性地提高了类别可分性和整体准确率。

Conclusion: 结合分层乘积系数特征与自编码器对提升LiDAR分类性能具有重要价值。

Abstract: This work extends our previous study on enhancing 3D LiDAR point-cloud
classification with product coefficients
\cite{medina2025integratingproductcoefficientsimproved}, measure-theoretic
descriptors that complement the original spatial Lidar features. Here, we show
that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based
baselines and our earlier framework. We also investigate the effect of adding
product coefficients level by level, revealing a clear trend: richer sets of
coefficients systematically improve class separability and overall accuracy.
The results highlight the value of combining hierarchical product-coefficient
features with autoencoders to push LiDAR classification performance further.

*Naoki Yoshida,Satoshi Hayakawa,Yuhta Takida,Toshimitsu Uesaka,Hiromi Wakaki,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出KME-CLIP方法，通过再生核希尔伯特空间的内积来改进多模态对比预训练中的相似度计算，更好地逼近点互信息(PMI)，在检索和分类任务中优于标准CLIP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP及其变体未能充分利用PMI的线性结构，而理论研究表明多模态配对的最优相似度度量应对应于点互信息。

Method: 提出KME-CLIP方法，利用再生核希尔伯特空间的内积来近似PMI，理论上可以任意精度逼近PMI。

Result: 经验证实在多个检索和分类任务中，该方法整体表现优于标准CLIP。

Conclusion: 通过利用PMI的线性结构，KME-CLIP能够更有效地计算多模态相似度，提升模型性能。

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

*Gabriel Nixon Raj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在分布漂移下的序列决策方法——熵正则化信任衰减，通过注入压力感知的指数倾斜来更新信念和做出镜像下降决策，实现了动态遗憾的O(√T)保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在分布漂移环境下的序列决策问题，传统方法在动态环境中表现不佳，需要开发能够适应分布变化的鲁棒决策框架。

Method: 提出熵正则化信任衰减方法，在信念更新和镜像下降决策中注入压力感知的指数倾斜，建立了Fenchel对偶等价性，并形式化了鲁棒性度量指标。

Result: 证明了高概率敏感性边界，在KL漂移路径长度ST下实现了O(√T)的动态遗憾保证，信任衰减方法实现了O(1)的每次切换遗憾，而无压力更新会导致Ω(1)的尾部风险。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了动态遗憾分析、分布鲁棒目标和KL正则化控制，提供了一个单一的压力自适应更新机制，并扩展到二阶更新、老虎机反馈、异常值处理等多个场景。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

TL;DR: Chronos-2是一个预训练的时间序列模型，能够以零样本方式处理单变量、多变量和协变量预测任务，通过组注意力机制实现上下文学习，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练时间序列模型主要关注单变量预测，限制了其在现实世界多变量数据和协变量场景中的适用性。

Method: 采用组注意力机制促进跨多个时间序列的上下文学习，通过在合成数据集上训练来获得通用能力，这些数据集在单变量序列上施加了多样化的多变量结构。

Result: 在fev-bench、GIFT-Eval和Chronos Benchmark II三个综合基准测试中达到最先进性能，特别是在多变量和协变量预测任务上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Chronos-2的上下文学习能力使其成为一个通用预测模型，可以直接用于现实世界的预测流程中。

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

TL;DR: FinTrust是一个专门评估金融领域LLM可信赖性的综合基准，涵盖多种对齐问题，通过细粒度任务评估11个LLM，发现专有模型在安全性等方面表现更好，而开源模型在特定领域有优势，所有模型在法律意识方面都存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于金融领域的高风险和高利害关系特性，在实际金融应用中应用LLM仍然具有挑战性，需要专门的可信赖性评估基准。

Method: 开发FinTrust基准，基于实际情境设计广泛的对齐问题，为每个可信赖性维度创建细粒度任务，评估11个LLM的表现。

Result: 专有模型如o4-mini在大多数任务（如安全性）中表现更好，开源模型如DeepSeek-V3在特定领域（如行业级公平性）有优势，所有LLM在受托责任对齐和披露等挑战性任务中表现不足。

Conclusion: FinTrust可以作为金融领域LLM可信赖性评估的有价值基准，当前LLM在法律意识方面存在显著差距，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related
problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains
challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TESSERA方法，为蛋白质-配体亲和力预测提供可靠的不确定性量化，在分布偏移下保证覆盖率，生成信息丰富且自适应的预测区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习社区缺乏可靠、信息丰富且个体化的不确定性量化方法，这阻碍了AI/ML在风险敏感领域的有效应用。特别是在药物发现中的蛋白质-配体亲和力预测，存在异质性噪声、化学空间不平衡和分布偏移等挑战。

Method: TESSERA结合专家混合模型的多样性和保形校准，提供每个样本的不确定性，具有可靠的覆盖率保证，生成信息丰富且自适应的预测区间宽度。

Result: 在独立同分布和基于支架的分布外分割下，TESSERA达到接近名义覆盖率，在覆盖率-宽度标准上表现最佳，同时保持竞争性的自适应能力。大小分层覆盖率确认区间大小合适。

Conclusion: 通过统一专家混合模型多样性与保形校准，TESSERA提供了可信、紧凑且自适应的不确定性，适用于药物发现管道中的选择性预测和下游决策制定。

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

TL;DR: 提出了双权重强化学习（DWRL）框架，将思维链推理与Bradley-Terry模型结合，用于处理非可验证任务的人类偏好建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在可验证答案任务上有效扩展思维链推理，但在非可验证的人类偏好任务上仍面临挑战且研究不足。

Method: DWRL通过双权重RL目标整合思维链推理与BT模型，包含实例级错位权重和组级条件偏好分数两个互补权重。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型规模上，DWRL始终优于GPM基线和标量模型，同时产生连贯、可解释的思维。

Conclusion: DWRL作为推理增强偏好学习的通用框架，可扩展到可验证任务之外。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

Result: 在测试集上表现优异：准确率0.9821、AUC 0.9803、平均精度0.9299、F1分数0.8836。

Conclusion: Transformer架构在禽类疾病监测早期预警系统中具有重要潜力，能够支持及时干预和预防策略。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These
results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support
early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely
intervention and prevention strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero通过分布鲁棒优化方法改进零样本提示优化，在分布偏移和对抗评估中显著提升提示的可靠性和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示搜索方法（如InstructZero）在单一评估分布下优化期望性能，导致提示在分布偏移和对抗评估中性能下降，缺乏可靠性。

Method: 将零样本提示优化建模为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布周围的模糊集，通过鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用，同时保持贝叶斯搜索的查询效率。

Result: 在形式化重写任务中准确率从61.3%提升至85-90%，代码调试在域偏移下提升约25个百分点，稳定任务如因果推理保持96%以上准确率。

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习相结合，提供了一种即插即用的通用方法，在现实世界不确定性下实现可靠、可迁移的提示对齐。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

Conclusion: 因果发现不仅是特征选择手段，更是构建可泛化、机制基础的地球表面动态过程模型的途径。

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

Conclusion: 所提出的不确定性感知伪标签框架有效缓解了不可靠伪标签的影响，为半监督回归提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

Motivation: 传统集合数据同化方法在分析精度和计算效率之间存在权衡，大集合规模提高精度但增加计算成本

Method: 结合集合卡尔曼滤波和全连接神经网络，先用小规模集合生成初步分析状态，再用神经网络学习预测校正项

Result: 在Lorenz系统和非线性海洋波场模拟实验中，新方法比传统EnKF在相同集合规模下精度更高，且额外计算成本可忽略

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN方法能够有效提高数据同化精度，适应性强，可与不同模型和集合数据同化方法结合

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Result: 在各种数据集上的实验表明，DFCA优于其他去中心化算法，在稀疏连接下仍能与集中式IFCA性能相当。

Conclusion: DFCA展示了其在动态真实世界去中心化网络中的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了可学习激活函数的随机特征模型(RFLAF)的泛化性质，通过数据依赖的采样方案显著提高了特征数量的边界要求，在回归和分类任务中都取得了最尖锐的边界结果。


<details>

Motivation: 研究RFLAF模型的泛化特性，旨在通过数据依赖的采样方案减少所需的特征数量，提高模型效率。

Method: 采用数据依赖的杠杆加权采样方案，提出算法来寻找近似核并应用杠杆加权采样，比较了普通采样和加权采样两种方案。

Result: 通过加权采样，MSE损失情况下的特征数量边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进为~Ω((1/ε)^{1/t})，当Gram矩阵有有限秩时甚至可达到Ω(1)。Lipschitz损失情况下的边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进为~Ω((1/ε²)^{1/t})。实验表明加权RFLAF能用更少特征达到相同性能。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的杠杆加权采样能显著减少RFLAF模型所需的特征数量，在理论和实验上都验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络防御方法通常只针对单一攻击类型，缺乏同时防御多种威胁的统一方法，需要开发能够应对后门攻击、边操纵和节点注入攻击的综合防御框架。

Method: 使用混合专家(MoE)架构，提出基于互信息的逻辑多样性损失来鼓励专家关注不同的邻域结构，并设计鲁棒性感知路由器来识别扰动模式并自适应路由受扰节点到相应的鲁棒专家。

Result: 在各种对抗设置下进行的广泛实验表明，该方法在对抗多种图对抗攻击时始终实现卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于MoE的统一防御框架能够有效同时防御多种图对抗攻击，通过逻辑多样性和自适应路由机制确保了在局部结构扰动下仍有足够专家子集不受影响。

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: 该方法为序列建模提供了新的算子理论视角，通过谱分解和梯度流技术实现了可扩展的学习和采样。

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Motivation: 现有零样本RL方法（如Forward-Backward表示）存在表达性不足和离线学习中外推误差导致表示偏差的问题，最终导致次优性能。

Method: 引入行为正则化将策略优化转化为稳定的样本内学习范式；使用任务条件扩散模型提取策略以生成高质量多模态动作分布；采用表达性注意力架构建模环境动态的复杂关系。

Conclusion: BREEZE通过同时增强学习稳定性、策略提取能力和表示学习质量，有效解决了零样本RL中的关键挑战，为学习预训练通用策略提供了更可靠的框架。

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available

Conclusion: SWFP框架通过将流匹配与JKO原理结合，提供了一种稳定高效的策略微调方法，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical
development, and beyond.

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

Conclusion: 基于通用逼近定理的闭式Transformer公式不仅解释了'深度信念'，还为设计高效Transformer架构开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

TL;DR: 提出SESA框架，通过顺序采样生成多样化解决方案草图，解决强化学习中探索不足和熵崩溃问题，提升LLM推理的多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在提升大语言模型推理能力时存在探索不足和熵崩溃问题，模型倾向于利用狭窄的解决方案集，导致采样多样性丧失，阻碍性能进一步提升。

Method: SESA顺序采样框架：首先生成多样化的解决方案草图，然后将其扩展为完整的推理路径。通过将每个新输出基于先前输出进行条件化，确保更广泛的探索。

Result: 在合成任务中，顺序采样在路径多样性和从崩溃中恢复方面持续优于传统RL方法。在三个智能体基准测试中，成功率分别提升+0.25、+0.42和+0.07（相比基线RL最高达211%相对改进）。

Conclusion: SESA提供了一种结构化的探索方法，为RL训练的大语言模型实现更有效和多样化的推理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

TL;DR: 本文证明Transformer语言模型是单射的，即不同输入会映射到不同输出，并提出了SipIt算法可以从隐藏激活中精确重建输入文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即Transformer组件如非线性激活和归一化是非单射的，可能阻止从模型表示中精确恢复输入。

Method: 首先数学证明Transformer语言模型在初始化和训练过程中保持单射性；其次通过数十亿次碰撞测试在六个最先进语言模型上验证；最后提出SipIt算法实现精确输入重建。

Result: 理论证明和实证测试均表明Transformer语言模型是单射的，SipIt算法能够在线性时间内从隐藏激活中精确重建输入文本。

Conclusion: 单射性是语言模型的基本且可利用属性，对透明度、可解释性和安全部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 知识蒸馏在低数据量情况下效果更显著，这一新发现被称为蒸馏的数据效率特性。研究通过大量实验验证了数据集大小是影响蒸馏机制的关键因素，并否定了蒸馏等同于标签平滑的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管知识蒸馏被广泛采用，但其工作机制仍不明确。以往研究关注模型大小和泛化能力，本研究从第三个维度——数据集大小——来探索蒸馏机制。

Method: 在多种数据集、任务和神经网络架构上进行广泛实验，测试不同数据集大小下蒸馏的效果，并验证现有理论在数据量变化时的预测能力。

Result: 发现蒸馏效果在低数据量情况下不仅保持而且增强，这种数据效率特性在各类实验中都得到验证。结果否定了蒸馏等同于标签平滑的假设，支持了暗知识假说。

Conclusion: 数据集大小可能是理解蒸馏机制的一个基本但被忽视的关键变量，这一发现为深入理解知识蒸馏提供了新视角。

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

in building compressed data models using implicit neural representations have
shown promising results for tasks like spatiotemporal volume visualization and
super-resolution. Inspired by these successes, we develop compressed neural
representations for multivariate datasets containing tens to hundreds of

all data variables simultaneously through parameter sharing. This allows us to
achieve state-of-the-art data compression. Through comprehensive evaluations,
we demonstrate superior performance in terms of reconstructed data quality,
rendering and visualization quality, preservation of dependency information
among variables, and storage efficiency.

TL;DR: MC Dropout不确定性在脑肿瘤MRI分割中对边界错误定位效果有限，与分割误差相关性较弱，需要开发替代或混合不确定性估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估MC Dropout在脑肿瘤MRI分割中识别分割错误的有效性，特别是在肿瘤边界区域，这对医学诊断和治疗规划至关重要。

Method: 使用U-Net在四种数据增强设置（无增强、水平翻转、旋转、缩放）下进行2D脑肿瘤MRI分割，通过50次随机前向传播计算不确定性，并使用Pearson和Spearman系数分析不确定性与像素级误差的相关性。

Result: 结果显示全局相关性较弱（r≈0.30-0.38），边界相关性可忽略（|r|<0.05）。虽然不同增强设置间的差异具有统计显著性（p<0.001），但缺乏实际意义。

Conclusion: MC Dropout不确定性在边界错误定位方面提供有限线索，突显了在医学图像分割中需要替代或混合不确定性估计方法的必要性。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

Motivation: 解决由战略代理行为引起的内生处理分配问题，在保持双重稳健性的同时纳入战略考量。

Method: 整合战略均衡建模与双重稳健估计框架，在战略无混杂性假设下进行理论分析。

Result: 实证评估显示SDR优于基线方法，在不同战略强度下实现7.6%-29.3%的偏差减少，并保持与代理群体规模的稳健可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架为代理对干预做出战略响应时的可靠因果推断提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Strategic Doubly Robust (SDR) estimator, a novel framework
that integrates strategic equilibrium modeling with doubly robust estimation
for causal inference in strategic environments. SDR addresses endogenous
treatment assignment arising from strategic agent behavior, maintaining double
robustness while incorporating strategic considerations. Theoretical analysis
confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic
unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance
over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying
strategic strengths and maintaining robust scalability with agent populations.
The framework provides a principled approach for reliable causal inference when
agents respond strategically to interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度神经网络的特征学习机制是建立数学基础的重要问题，神经特征假设(NFA)提供了一个理论框架来描述训练后网络权重的结构特性。

Method: 使用梯度流动力学和平衡权重初始化，分析多层线性网络的训练过程，并通过数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 对于L≥2层的线性网络，NFA在整个训练过程中成立且指数α=1/L；对于不平衡初始化，在权重衰减下NFA渐近成立；但在某些非线性网络中NFA不成立。

Conclusion: NFA的深度依赖性得到了理论证明，但该假设对网络架构和激活函数敏感，在非线性网络中可能失效。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受迭代联合图传播(IJGP)算法启发，旨在通过神经网络方法改进#SAT问题的求解精度。

Method: 使用树分解将CNF公式编码为联合图，在图上执行迭代消息传递，通过学习分区函数来近似模型数量，并应用注意力机制来关注关键变量和簇。

Result: 实验表明Attn-JGNN模型比其他神经网络方法取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 注意力增强的联合图神经网络能够有效提高#SAT问题的求解精度，通过注意力机制减少冗余计算并关注关键推理元素。

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRATING是一个无需训练的推理系统，通过渐进式聚类剪枝和内存优化策略，显著降低语义Top-K选择任务的延迟和内存使用，在保持精度的同时提升边缘设备上的部署效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义Top-K选择在边缘AI服务中延迟和内存需求过高，而实际应用中只需要相对排名而非精确分数，且中间层存在序列级稀疏性，为优化提供了机会。

Method: 提出整体前向传播和GRATING系统，通过渐进式聚类剪枝减少延迟，采用双层滑动窗口和分块执行策略来限制峰值内存使用，并重叠I/O与计算。

Result: 在0.6B到8B参数的reranker上测试，GRATING在微基准测试中延迟降低达89.0%，峰值内存减少达94.9%，在三个真实应用中延迟降低11.6%-51.0%，内存减少18.6%-77.8%。

Conclusion: GRATING通过利用相对排名特性和序列级稀疏性，在不损失精度的情况下显著提升了语义Top-K选择任务的效率和部署能力。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

TL;DR: 提出了CQD-SHAP框架，用于解释复杂查询回答中各个查询部分对特定答案排名的贡献，基于Shapley值理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的复杂查询回答方法大多是黑盒模型，缺乏解释性。虽然神经符号方法如CQD允许跟踪中间结果，但无法解释查询不同部分的重要性。

Method: 基于合作博弈论中的Shapley值，计算每个查询部分对答案排名的贡献，满足所有基本Shapley公理。

Result: 自动化评估显示，该方法在必要性和充分性解释方面对大多数查询类型有效，优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP能够有效解释神经预测器从不完整知识图谱中推断新知识的价值，而不是仅仅依赖知识图谱中现有事实的符号方法。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

Motivation: Tsetlin机器在资源受限设备上具有高速推理能力，其逻辑驱动操作适合在现代CPU架构上并行执行。

Method: 利用指令级位运算进行紧凑模型表示和加速处理，引入基于AND子句评估的提前退出机制，并通过统计分析提出文字重排序策略。

Result: 在ARM处理器上的实验结果显示，优化实现相比传统基于整数的TM实现减少了高达96.71%的推理时间，同时保持相当的代码密度。

Conclusion: 所提出的优化方法显著提升了Tsetlin机器的推理效率，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

Result: 在CIFAR-10上比DLGNs收敛显著更快，同时保持可比较的准确率。

Conclusion: WARP-LUTs方法为在现代FPGA上高效部署和实时科学应用提供了潜力，可扩展到更高输入逻辑块。

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

Method: 两阶段方法：先探索解空间，然后学习输入特定的温度T和偏移向量δ来校准logits，引导生成更可靠的推理路径

Result: 在MATH-500和AIME-2024上，CarBoN效率提升4倍，在相同采样次数下达到更高准确率

Conclusion: CarBoN框架有效提升推理任务的测试时扩展效率，T和δ在平衡输出多样性和正确性方面发挥互补作用

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

Motivation: 传统有限元方法分析IPMSM转子形状计算成本高，需要寻找更快速、成本更低的替代方案。

Method: 使用自定义深度学习模型KS-Net，并与Cubic SVM、Quadratic SVM、Fine KNN、Cosine KNN和Fine Tree算法进行对比评估。使用9000个样本的平衡数据集，采用10折交叉验证。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可以高精度预测IPMSM转子形状，为加速电机设计过程、开发自动转子识别系统和数据驱动的故障诊断提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

Conclusion: CAP方法能有效处理约束特征空间中的对抗攻击，并提出了从数据中学习特征约束的原则性方法，适用于具有结构化输入空间的广泛领域。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

### [180] [ProofOptimizer: Training Language Models to Simplify Proofs without Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15700)
*Alex Gu,Bartosz Piotrowski,Fabian Gloeckle,Kaiyu Yang,Aram H. Markosyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProofOptimizer是一个通过专家迭代和强化学习训练的语言模型，专门用于简化Lean证明，无需人工监督即可大幅压缩证明长度并提升验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经定理证明生成的证明过于冗长（数千行），虽然能被Lean等系统验证，但人类难以理解且缺乏数学洞察力。证明简化成为关键瓶颈，但训练数据稀缺，现有方法难以处理RL训练证明器生成的超长证明。

Method: 采用专家迭代和强化学习训练ProofOptimizer语言模型，利用Lean验证简化结果并提供训练信号。推理时采用迭代证明缩短工作流，逐步减少证明长度。

Result: 在标准基准测试中显著压缩证明长度：miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，Seed-Prover的IMO 2025证明减少49%。简化后的证明在Lean中验证更快，且作为训练数据能进一步提升下游证明器性能。

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer是首个无需人工监督即可简化Lean证明的语言模型，能有效解决证明冗长问题，提升证明的可理解性和实用性。

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

*Edwin Hamel-De le Court,Gaspard Ohlmann,Francesco Belardinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProSh是一种基于风险增强的概率屏蔽模型无关安全强化学习算法，通过将约束MDP状态空间与风险预算增强，并使用学习到的成本评论家对策略分布应用屏蔽，确保所有采样动作在期望上保持安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习系统的安全性是主要关注点，需要开发不仅性能最优且能提供正式安全保证的系统，确保部署安全。

Method: 引入概率屏蔽通过风险增强方法，将约束MDP状态空间与风险预算增强，使用学习到的成本评论家对策略分布应用屏蔽，确保采样动作在期望上保持安全。

Result: 在确定性环境中保持最优性，提供仅依赖于备份评论家准确度的成本期望紧上界，在训练期间始终满足。在实验显示，在温和且实际可实现的假设下，ProSh即使在训练时也能保证安全性。

Conclusion: ProSh是一种有效的模型无关安全强化学习算法，能够提供正式的安全保证，在训练和部署阶段都能确保系统安全性。

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

*Mahyar Alinejad,Alvaro Velasquez,Yue Wang,George Atia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自动机反馈的强化学习方法，利用确定性有限自动机(DFA)生成轨迹偏好来学习奖励函数，替代传统的手动奖励工程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有复杂历史依赖奖励结构的强化学习环境中的挑战，传统方法难以处理非马尔可夫奖励。

Method: 使用DFA结构生成轨迹偏好来学习奖励函数，包括静态方法（直接使用学习到的奖励函数进行策略优化）和动态方法（通过迭代更新持续优化奖励函数和策略）。

Result: 在离散和连续环境中，该方法能够学习具有时间依赖任务的有效策略，优于传统奖励工程和基于自动机的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于自动机的偏好方法在处理非马尔可夫奖励方面具有优势，提供了可扩展、高效且不依赖人工的奖励建模替代方案，并具有收敛保证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

TL;DR: 本文评估了图神经网络和3D U-Net作为参数化工字梁有限元分析的替代模型，发现GNN显著优于U-Net，其中MPNN和Graph Transformer表现最佳，物理信息神经网络框架显著提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限元分析计算成本高，不适合设计优化问题，需要寻找深度学习模型作为替代方案。

Method: 使用图神经网络和3D U-Net作为FEA替代模型，引入基于Navier-Cauchy方程的物理信息神经网络框架，采用课程学习策略（数据预训练+物理信息微调）。

Result: GNN显著优于U-Net，MPNN和Graph Transformer相对L2误差分别为3.5%和2.6%，物理信息框架将误差降低达11.3%。

Conclusion: MPNN PINN提供了最佳实用解决方案，在预测性能、模型大小和推理速度之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

*Trung-Anh Dang,Vincent Nguyen,Ngoc-Son Vu,Christel Vrain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)方法，在神经坍缩框架下通过自适应混合策略增强持续学习模型的校准性和性能，减少过自信和遗忘，提高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要关注减轻遗忘和提高准确率，但忽视了网络校准的重要性。神经坍缩现象在持续学习中显示出优势，但很少有工作专门改进持续学习模型的校准以获得更可靠的预测。

Method: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)，一种针对神经坍缩方法定制的自适应混合策略。该方法根据神经坍缩下特征空间的几何特性调整混合过程，确保更稳健的正则化和对齐。

Result: 实验表明SAMix显著提升了性能，在持续学习中超越了最先进方法，同时改善了模型校准。该方法提高了跨任务准确率和预测的可靠性。

Conclusion: SAMix是构建稳健持续学习系统的一个有前景的进展，能够同时增强校准性和性能表现。

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust
continual learning systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中小型家禽养殖场缺乏经济实惠的集成工具进行连续监测和决策，主要依赖手动、被动的检查方式，难以同时满足生产力目标、动物福利和环境合规要求。

Method: 使用进化算法离线优化摄像头布局实现全覆盖；视听监测模块从同步视频、音频和喂食数据中提取福利指标；边缘视觉模型实现实时鸡蛋计数；预测模型进行10天内的产量和饲料消耗预测；推荐模块整合预测和天气数据提供操作建议。

Conclusion: PoultryFI填补了孤立试点工具与可扩展农场智能之间的空白，使生产者能够主动保障动物福利和盈利能力。

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
profitability.

generation. Next, we show favorable performances of AB-UPT against previous
state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines on both datasets, followed by
extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our best AB-UPT model.
AB-UPT shows strong performances across the board. Notably, it obtains near

TL;DR: 论文发现DiLoCo优化器的有效性主要来自对伪梯度应用Nesterov动量，提出了SNOO优化器，在非分布式设置中实现1.5-2.5倍计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Lookahead系列优化器中DiLoCo在非分布式设置下表现优异的原因，特别是Nesterov动量对伪梯度的作用。

Method: 提出SNOO优化器，在Lookahead的两循环框架中，对伪梯度应用Nesterov动量更新慢权重。

Result: SNOO在非分布式设置中达到1.5-2.5倍计算效率提升，且模型规模越大提升越明显，兼容AdamW、Muon等内部优化器。

Conclusion: SNOO通过简单有效的Nesterov动量应用，显著提升训练效率，是实用的优化器增强方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

TL;DR: 提出FIDDLE学习框架，通过高斯过程代理模型和强化学习模块在量子电路路由阶段直接最大化过程保真度，优于依赖间接指标的传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子设备受噪声影响，可靠性降低。在门基量子计算中，提高量子电路在编译过程（特别是路由阶段）的过程保真度是关键挑战。

Method: FIDDLE框架包含两个模块：基于高斯过程的代理模型（用有限训练样本估计过程保真度）和强化学习模块（优化路由）。这是首个直接最大化过程保真度的方法。

Result: 与最先进的保真度估计技术和路由优化方法相比，提出的代理模型能提供更好的过程保真度估计，端到端框架在各种噪声模型下显著提高了量子电路的过程保真度。

Conclusion: FIDDLE框架在量子电路路由阶段有效提高了过程保真度，为噪声量子设备的可靠性提升提供了新途径。

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨物种转录组数据利用不足的问题，通过生物学的同源关系来指导知识转移，提高转移学习的效果和可解释性。

Method: 在预训练的前馈神经网络前添加物种转换层，该层的权重由物种间二分图的邻接矩阵进行掩码，学习从源物种到目标物种基因表达的线性变换。

Result: TRON提供了一种生物学基础且可解释的跨物种转移学习方法，能够有效利用现有转录组数据，转换层的权重可用于解释功能同源性。

Conclusion: TRON为跨物种转移学习提供了新的架构方向，目前正在收集跨物种转录组/表型数据进行实验验证。

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于Navier-Stokes偏微分方程的空间处理效应连续函数框架，将处理强度建模为时空连续函数，能够分析边界演化、空间梯度和累积暴露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散处理参数方法无法充分捕捉空间效应的连续性和动态演化，需要开发能够表征空间梯度、边界演化和累积暴露的连续框架。

Method: 使用Navier-Stokes偏微分方程建立连续函数框架，将处理强度建模为时空连续函数τ(x,t)，通过32,520个美国邮政编码数据进行实证验证。

Result: 医疗可及性呈现指数空间衰减（κ=0.002837/km，R²=0.0129），检测到37.1km的边界；模型选择强烈支持对数衰减而非指数衰减（ΔAIC>10,000）；老年人群距离效应强2-13倍。

Conclusion: 连续函数框架提供了预测能力、参数敏感性和诊断测试，这些在传统差分方法中不可用，适用于环境经济学、银行和医疗政策等多个领域。

Abstract: I develop a continuous functional framework for spatial treatment effects
grounded in Navier-Stokes partial differential equations. Rather than discrete
treatment parameters, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as
continuous functions $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous
analysis of boundary evolution, spatial gradients, and cumulative exposure.
Empirical validation using 32,520 U.S. ZIP codes demonstrates exponential
spatial decay for healthcare access ($\kappa = 0.002837$ per km, $R^2 =
0.0129$) with detectable boundaries at 37.1 km. The framework successfully
diagnoses when scope conditions hold: positive decay parameters validate
diffusion assumptions near hospitals, while negative parameters correctly
signal urban confounding effects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals 2-13 $\times$
stronger distance effects for elderly populations and substantial education
gradients. Model selection strongly favors logarithmic decay over exponential
($\Delta \text{AIC} > 10,000$), representing a middle ground between
exponential and power-law decay. Applications span environmental economics,
banking, and healthcare policy. The continuous functional framework provides
predictive capability ($d^*(t) = \xi^* \sqrt{t}$), parameter sensitivity
($\partial d^*/\partial \nu$), and diagnostic tests unavailable in traditional
difference-in-differences approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI有潜力显著改善NGO利用有限资源实现社会效益的方式，但关于NGO采用AI的证据仍然分散，需要系统研究。

Method: 遵循PRISMA协议，两位独立评审员进行文献筛选，采用主题和叙事分析方法，最终纳入65项研究，在技术-组织-环境(TOE)框架内分析挑战和解决方案。

Result: 识别出NGO中六类AI用例：参与、创意、决策、预测、管理和优化；发现AI采用在NGO中不均衡，偏向大型组织，但基于文献的路线图可帮助克服初始障碍。

Conclusion: AI在NGO中具有前景，但采用仍不均衡。通过基于文献的路线图，NGO可以克服AI采用的初始障碍，最终提高效率、参与度和社会影响力。

Abstract: AI has the potential to significantly improve how NGOs utilize their limited
resources for societal benefits, but evidence about how NGOs adopt AI remains
scattered. In this study, we systematically investigate the types of AI
adoption use cases in NGOs and identify common challenges and solutions,
contextualized by organizational size and geographic context. We review the
existing primary literature, including studies that investigate AI adoption in
NGOs related to social impact between 2020 and 2025 in English. Following the
PRISMA protocol, two independent reviewers conduct study selection, with
regular cross-checking to ensure methodological rigour, resulting in a final
literature body of 65 studies. Leveraging a thematic and narrative approach, we
identify six AI use case categories in NGOs - Engagement, Creativity,
Decision-Making, Prediction, Management, and Optimization - and extract common
challenges and solutions within the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE)
framework. By integrating our findings, this review provides a novel
understanding of AI adoption in NGOs, linking specific use cases and challenges
to organizational and environmental factors. Our results demonstrate that while
AI is promising, adoption among NGOs remains uneven and biased towards larger
organizations. Nevertheless, following a roadmap grounded in literature can
help NGOs overcome initial barriers to AI adoption, ultimately improving
effectiveness, engagement, and social impact.

TL;DR: 本研究基于扩展的UTAUT模型，调查了人口统计因素对员工AI技术采用和态度的影响，发现组织层级显著预测AI采用率，而经验和地区影响较小，情感因素在AI接受度中起重要作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索人口统计因素（工作经验、组织层级、地理区域）如何影响员工对工作场所AI技术的采用和态度，以更全面地理解技术接受度的个体差异。

Method: 采用扩展的UTAUT模型，增加了态度、自我效能和焦虑等情感维度，对跨国咨询公司的2,257名专业人员进行了调查，使用非参数检验分析人口统计因素与AI采用、使用强度和八个UTAUT构念的关系。

Result: 组织层级显著预测AI采用，资深员工使用率更高；经验和地区与采用无关。AI用户群体中，使用频率和时长的人口统计差异很小，但在焦虑、绩效期望和行为意图等UTAUT构念上存在小而一致的群体差异。

Conclusion: 人口统计因素对AI接受度的解释力有限，但对理解技术相关态度的情境差异仍具相关性。研究强调需要将情感和组织因素整合到技术接受模型中，以支持现代工作场所中公平、自信和可持续的AI参与。

Abstract: This study investigates whether demographic factors shape adoption and
attitudes among employees toward artificial intelligence (AI) technologies at
work. Building on an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of
Technology (UTAUT), which reintroduces affective dimensions such as attitude,
self-efficacy, and anxiety, we surveyed 2,257 professionals across global
regions and organizational levels within a multinational consulting firm.
Non-parametric tests examined whether three demographic factors (i.e., years of
experience, hierarchical level in the organization, and geographic region) were
associated with AI adoption, usage intensity, and eight UTAUT constructs.
Organizational level significantly predicted AI adoption, with senior employees
showing higher usage rates, while experience and region were unrelated to
adoption. Among AI users (n = 1,256), frequency and duration of use showed
minimal demographic variation. However, omnibus tests revealed small but
consistent group differences across several UTAUT constructs, particularly
anxiety, performance expectancy, and behavioral intention, suggesting that
emotional and cognitive responses to AI vary modestly across contexts. These
findings highlight that demographic factors explain limited variance in AI
acceptance but remain relevant for understanding contextual nuances in
technology-related attitudes. The results underscore the need to integrate
affective and organizational factors into models of technology acceptance to
support equitable, confident, and sustainable engagement with AI in modern
workplaces.

TL;DR: 本文提出了"美学不对称"概念来解释左翼和右翼运动在艺术形式使用上的差异：左翼倾向使用参与式艺术（如壁画、抗议歌曲）来构建社区和团结，而右翼则更注重战略沟通和数字迷因文化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究为什么左翼运动历史上整合参与式艺术形式，而右翼运动优先考虑战略沟通和数字迷因文化，这种差异背后的结构性原因。

Method: 通过比较分析，从组织生态系统、道德情感框架、物质支持和历史传统四个相互关联的结构性因素来解释美学不对称现象。

Result: 发现左翼倾向于以构成性方式使用艺术来建立社区、团结和希望，而当代右翼则工具性地使用艺术来动员极化情感如幽默和怨恨。

Conclusion: 理解这种美学不对称对于分析政治沟通和设计能够产生深刻社会变革的文化干预至关重要，文章最后提出了一个艺术行动的规定性模型。

Abstract: Why have left-wing movements historically integrated participatory art forms
(such as murals and protest songs) into their praxis, while right-wing
movements have prioritized strategic communication and, more recently, the
digital culture of memes? This article introduces the concept of aesthetic
asymmetry to explain this divergence in political action. We argue that the
asymmetry is not coincidental but the result of four interconnected structural
factors: the organizational ecosystem, the moral and emotional framework, the
material supports, and the historical tradition of each political spectrum.
While the left tends to use art in a constitutive manner to forge community,
solidarity, and hope, the contemporary right tends to use it instrumentally to
mobilize polarizing affects such as humor and resentment. Drawing on
comparative literature from the Theatre of the Oppressed to analyses of
alt-right meme wars, we nuance this distinction and show how the aesthetic
logic of each pole aligns with its strategic objectives. The article culminates
in a prescriptive model for artistic action, synthesizing keys to effective
mobilization into emotional, narrative, and formatting strategies.
Understanding this asymmetry is crucial for analyzing political communication
and for designing cultural interventions capable of generating profound social
change.

TL;DR: VERA-MH是一个用于评估心理健康AI聊天机器人安全性的自动化系统，专注于自杀风险。它使用两个AI代理：用户代理模拟患者对话，法官代理根据临床专家制定的评分标准进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化工具来评估心理健康AI聊天机器人的安全性，特别是针对自杀风险管理的伦理和负责任AI实践。

Method: 使用两个AI代理：用户代理模拟不同风险等级的患者与待测聊天机器人对话，法官代理根据临床专家制定的评分标准对对话进行评分。

Result: 已对GPT-5、Claude Opus和Claude Sonnet进行了初步评估，并将结果用于进一步的设计开发。系统仍在临床验证和完善中。

Conclusion: VERA-MH是一个有前景的自动化评估框架，但需要更严格的临床验证和迭代改进，以提供可靠的心理健康AI安全性评估。

Abstract: We introduce VERA-MH (Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental
Health), an automated evaluation of the safety of AI chatbots used in mental
health contexts, with an initial focus on suicide risk.
  Practicing clinicians and academic experts developed a rubric informed by
best practices for suicide risk management for the evaluation. To fully
automate the process, we used two ancillary AI agents. A user-agent model
simulates users engaging in a mental health-based conversation with the chatbot
under evaluation. The user-agent role-plays specific personas with pre-defined
risk levels and other features. Simulated conversations are then passed to a
judge-agent who scores them based on the rubric. The final evaluation of the
chatbot being tested is obtained by aggregating the scoring of each
conversation.
  VERA-MH is actively under development and undergoing rigorous validation by
mental health clinicians to ensure user-agents realistically act as patients
and that the judge-agent accurately scores the AI chatbot. To date we have
conducted preliminary evaluation of GPT-5, Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet using
initial versions of the VERA-MH rubric and used the findings for further design
development. Next steps will include more robust clinical validation and
iteration, as well as refining actionable scoring. We are seeking feedback from
the community on both the technical and clinical aspects of our evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着虚假信息驱动的认知攻击日益复杂，量化其影响对于推进网络安全防御策略至关重要。

Method: 应用该模型到社交媒体平台上的真实世界虚假信息活动，展示了该指标如何捕捉用户参与的行为深度而不仅仅是覆盖范围。

Result: 研究结果提供了对认知战行为动态的新见解。

Conclusion: 为研究人员和从业者提供了评估和对抗在线恶意影响传播的可操作工具。

Abstract: As disinformation-driven cognitive attacks become increasingly sophisticated,
the ability to quantify their impact is essential for advancing cybersecurity
defense strategies. This paper presents a novel framework for measuring the
engagement effectiveness of cognitive attacks by introducing a weighted
interaction metric that accounts for both the type and volume of user
engagement relative to the number of attacker-generated transmissions. Applying
this model to real-world disinformation campaigns across social media
platforms, we demonstrate how the metric captures not just reach but the
behavioral depth of user engagement. Our findings provide new insights into the
behavioral dynamics of cognitive warfare and offer actionable tools for
researchers and practitioners seeking to assess and counter the spread of
malicious influence online.

### [197] [DeepAries: Adaptive Rebalancing Interval Selection for Enhanced Portfolio Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14985)
*Jinkyu Kim,Hyunjung Yi,Mogan Gim,Donghee Choi,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: DeepAries是一个新颖的深度强化学习框架，用于动态投资组合管理，联合优化再平衡时机和资产配置决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法使用固定的再平衡间隔，不考虑市场条件变化，导致不必要的交易成本和次优收益。

Method: 集成基于Transformer的状态编码器和PPO算法，同时生成离散的再平衡间隔和连续的资产配置动作。

Result: 在多个真实金融市场上的实验表明，DeepAries在风险调整收益、交易成本和回撤方面显著优于传统固定频率策略。

Conclusion: DeepAries通过将时机和配置整合到统一决策过程中，为自适应和实用的投资组合管理引入了创新范式。

Abstract: We propose DeepAries , a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for
dynamic portfolio management that jointly optimizes the timing and allocation
of rebalancing decisions. Unlike prior reinforcement learning methods that
employ fixed rebalancing intervals regardless of market conditions, DeepAries
adaptively selects optimal rebalancing intervals along with portfolio weights
to reduce unnecessary transaction costs and maximize risk-adjusted returns. Our
framework integrates a Transformer-based state encoder, which effectively
captures complex long-term market dependencies, with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) to generate simultaneous discrete (rebalancing intervals)
and continuous (asset allocations) actions. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world financial markets demonstrate that DeepAries significantly
outperforms traditional fixed-frequency and full-rebalancing strategies in
terms of risk-adjusted returns, transaction costs, and drawdowns. Additionally,
we provide a live demo of DeepAries at https://deep-aries.github.io/, along
with the source code and dataset at https://github.com/dmis-lab/DeepAries,
illustrating DeepAries' capability to produce interpretable rebalancing and
allocation decisions aligned with shifting market regimes. Overall, DeepAries
introduces an innovative paradigm for adaptive and practical portfolio
management by integrating both timing and allocation into a unified
decision-making process.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: RegimeFolio是一个新颖的机制感知和行业专业化投资组合框架，通过整合显式波动机制分割、行业特定集成预测和自适应均值-方差分配，在动态市场中提高稳健性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场本质上是非平稳的，具有不断变化的波动机制，而标准的投资组合优化方法通常基于平稳性或机制不可知假设，难以适应这种变化。

Method: RegimeFolio包含三个组件：(i)基于VIX的可解释市场机制分类器；(ii)机制和行业特定的集成学习器；(iii)具有收缩正则化协方差估计的动态均值-方差优化器。

Result: 在2020-2024年34只美国大盘股的评估中，RegimeFolio实现了137%的累计回报、1.17的夏普比率、最大回撤降低12%，预测准确性比传统和先进机器学习基准提高15-20%。

Conclusion: 在预测学习和投资组合分配中显式建模波动机制可以增强稳健性，并在真实市场中带来更可靠的决策。

Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary, with shifting volatility
regimes that alter asset co-movements and return distributions. Standard
portfolio optimization methods, typically built on stationarity or
regime-agnostic assumptions, struggle to adapt to such changes. To address
these challenges, we propose RegimeFolio, a novel regime-aware and
sector-specialized framework that, unlike existing regime-agnostic models such
as DeepVol and DRL optimizers, integrates explicit volatility regime
segmentation with sector-specific ensemble forecasting and adaptive
mean-variance allocation. This modular architecture ensures forecasts and
portfolio decisions remain aligned with current market conditions, enhancing
robustness and interpretability in dynamic markets. RegimeFolio combines three
components: (i) an interpretable VIX-based classifier for market regime
detection; (ii) regime and sector-specific ensemble learners (Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting) to capture conditional return structures; and (iii) a
dynamic mean-variance optimizer with shrinkage-regularized covariance estimates
for regime-aware allocation. We evaluate RegimeFolio on 34 large cap U.S.
equities from 2020 to 2024. The framework achieves a cumulative return of 137
percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.17, a 12 percent lower maximum drawdown, and a 15
to 20 percent improvement in forecast accuracy compared to conventional and
advanced machine learning benchmarks. These results show that explicitly
modeling volatility regimes in predictive learning and portfolio allocation
enhances robustness and leads to more dependable decision-making in real
markets.

*Davide Ferrari,Alessandro Fulci,Sandra Paterlini*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: 提出了选择置信集(SCS)方法来解决等权重投资组合选择中的不确定性，识别出一系列在统计意义上同样优秀的投资组合，而非单一最优选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常依赖单一选定的投资组合，但忽略了统计不确定性下可能存在多个表现相当的替代策略。投资者在构建等权重投资组合时面临选择不确定性，需要量化这种不确定性。

Method: 引入选择置信集(SCS)概念，该集合包含在给定损失函数和置信水平下所有可能的最优投资组合，其大小反映了选择不确定性程度。

Result: 理论证明SCS以高概率覆盖未知的最优选择，并通过蒙特卡洛实验验证了其有效性。在法国17行业投资组合和Layer-1加密货币的应用中展示了选择不确定性的重要性。

Conclusion: SCS方法挑战了唯一最优选择的概念，为投资组合选择提供了更全面的不确定性量化框架，有助于投资者更好地理解和管理选择风险。

Abstract: Given a universe of N assets, investors often form equally weighted
portfolios (EWPs) by selecting subsets of assets. EWPs are simple, robust, and
competitive out-of-sample, yet the uncertainty about which subset truly
performs best is largely ignored. Traditional approaches typically rely on a
single selected portfolio, but this fails to consider alternative investment
strategies that may perform just as well when accounting for statistical
uncertainty. To address this selection uncertainty, we introduce the Selection
Confidence Set (SCS) for EWPs: the set of all portfolios that, under a given
loss function and at a specified confidence level, contains the unknown set of
optimal portfolios under repeated sampling. The SCS quantifies selection
uncertainty by identifying a range of plausible portfolios, challenging the
idea of a uniquely optimal choice. Like a confidence set, its size reflects
uncertainty -- growing with noisy or limited data, and shrinking as the sample
size increases. Theoretically, we establish that the SCS covers the unknown
optimal selection with high probability and characterize how its size grows
with underlying uncertainty, corroborating these results through Monte Carlo
experiments. Applications to the French 17-Industry Portfolios and Layer-1
cryptocurrencies underscore the importance of accounting for selection
uncertainty when comparing equally weighted strategies.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: 该研究比较了移动窗口法和自助法在构建不确定性集合时的表现，发现移动窗口法配合较小的风险厌恶参数能提供更好的风险收益权衡，特别适合风险容忍度较高的投资者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于COVID-19疫情后印尼证券交易所投资者数量增加，需要更好的投资组合优化方法来平衡风险和收益。传统的均值-方差优化依赖历史数据估计，存在不确定性，可能导致次优投资组合。

Method: 使用移动窗口法和自助法构建不确定性集合，并将其应用于印尼银行股票数据，同时调整不同的风险厌恶参数进行稳健优化。

Result: 结果显示，采用移动窗口法的稳健优化，特别是配合较小的风险厌恶参数时，比自助法提供了更好的风险收益权衡。

Conclusion: 移动窗口法在构建不确定性集合方面具有潜力，能为风险容忍度较高的投资者生成更有效的投资组合策略。

Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of investors in the Indonesia Stock
Exchange has steadily increased, emphasizing the importance of portfolio
optimization in balancing risk and return. The classical mean-variance
optimization model, while widely applied, depends on historical return and risk
estimates that are uncertain and may result in suboptimal portfolios. To
address this limitation, robust optimization incorporates uncertainty sets to
improve portfolio reliability under market fluctuations. This study constructs
such sets using moving-window and bootstrapping methods and applies them to
Indonesian banking stock data with varying risk-aversion parameters. The
results show that robust optimization with the moving-window method,
particularly with a smaller risk-aversion parameter, provides a better
risk-return trade-off compared to the bootstrapping approach. These findings
highlight the potential of the moving-window method to generate more effective
portfolio strategies for risk-tolerant investors.

*Yi-Shan Chu,Yueh-Cheng Kuo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文通过热带几何视角重新审视通用逼近定理，提出了一种构造性的几何感知初始化方法，用于构建具有预定形状决策边界的sigmoid多层感知机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接热带几何理论与平滑MLP之间的实践桥梁，实现可解释的、形状驱动的初始化，而不依赖ReLU架构。

Method: 利用热带几何理论，设计纯sigmoid MLP，使其在初始化时就具有与预定形状对齐的决策边界，采用有限线性组合的格式。

Result: 构建的模型在初始化时决策边界就能与预定形状对齐，可以通过标准训练进一步优化，在二维分类任务中进行了实证验证。

Conclusion: 为热带几何视角与平滑MLP之间提供了实践桥梁，实现了形状驱动的初始化方法，但理论分析和高维扩展有待未来研究。

Abstract: We revisit the Universal Approximation Theorem(UAT) through the lens of the
tropical geometry of neural networks and introduce a constructive,
geometry-aware initialization for sigmoidal multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).
Tropical geometry shows that Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks admit
decision functions with a combinatorial structure often described as a tropical
rational, namely a difference of tropical polynomials. Focusing on planar
binary classification, we design purely sigmoidal MLPs that adhere to the
finite-sum format of UAT: a finite linear combination of shifted and scaled
sigmoids of affine functions. The resulting models yield decision boundaries
that already align with prescribed shapes at initialization and can be refined
by standard training if desired. This provides a practical bridge between the
tropical perspective and smooth MLPs, enabling interpretable, shape-driven
initialization without resorting to ReLU architectures. We focus on the
construction and empirical demonstrations in two dimensions; theoretical
analysis and higher-dimensional extensions are left for future work.

*Magnus Neuman,Jelena Smiljanić,Martin Rosvall*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出使用基于最小描述长度原则的贝叶斯社区检测方法（Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model和Regularized Map Equation）来替代传统聚类方法，以解决噪声环境下模块结构检测的可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法（如层次聚类、k-means、WGCNA）缺乏原则性模型选择，容易受噪声影响。常用的稀疏化相关矩阵方法引入任意阈值，会扭曲结构并导致不可靠结果。

Method: 采用两种基于最小描述长度原则的贝叶斯社区检测方法：Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model和Regularized Map Equation，将稀疏化和聚类与原则性模型选择相结合。

Result: 在合成数据中，新方法在高噪声条件下能检测到植入的簇，且需要更少样本。在基因共表达数据中，Regularized Map Equation比WGCNA识别出更稳健和功能一致的基因模块。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯社区检测为跨领域高维数据中的模块结构发现提供了一个原则性和抗噪声的框架。

Abstract: From neuroscience and genomics to systems biology and ecology, researchers
rely on clustering similarity data to uncover modular structure. Yet widely
used clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering, k-means, and WGCNA,
lack principled model selection, leaving them susceptible to noise. A common
workaround sparsifies a correlation matrix representation to remove noise
before clustering, but this extra step introduces arbitrary thresholds that can
distort the structure and lead to unreliable results. To detect reliable
clusters, we capitalize on recent advances in network science to unite
sparsification and clustering with principled model selection. We test two
Bayesian community detection methods, the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block
Model and the Regularized Map Equation, both grounded in the Minimum
Description Length principle for model selection. In synthetic data, they
outperform traditional approaches, detecting planted clusters under high-noise
conditions and with fewer samples. Compared to WGCNA on gene co-expression
data, the Regularized Map Equation identifies more robust and functionally
coherent gene modules. Our results establish Bayesian community detection as a
principled and noise-resistant framework for uncovering modular structure in
high-dimensional data across fields.

TL;DR: 提出了tree-SNE方法，通过增加尺度参数将2维t-SNE扩展为(2+1)维嵌入，解决高维数据聚类中的尺度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非线性降维方法（如t-SNE、UMAP）在聚类时面临的尺度问题——在不同任务下需要区分不同层次的聚类结构。

Method: 利用t-SNE中的尺度对称性，增加一个尺度参数，将2维嵌入扩展为(2+1)维，创建t-SNE树结构。

Result: 证明了对于几乎所有初始条件，最优嵌入在尺度参数上连续变化，即tree-SNE树存在。该方法可扩展到其他吸引-排斥方法。

Conclusion: tree-SNE通过引入尺度参数有效解决了聚类中的尺度依赖问题，为高维数据可视化提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The clustering and visualisation of high-dimensional data is a ubiquitous
task in modern data science. Popular techniques include nonlinear
dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE or UMAP. These methods face the
`scale-problem' of clustering: when dealing with the MNIST dataset, do we want
to distinguish different digits or do we want to distinguish different ways of
writing the digits? The answer is task dependent and depends on scale. We
revisit an idea of Robinson & Pierce-Hoffman that exploits an underlying
scaling symmetry in t-SNE to replace 2-dimensional with (2+1)-dimensional
embeddings where the additional parameter accounts for scale. This gives rise
to the t-SNE tree (short: tree-SNE). We prove that the optimal embedding
depends continuously on the scaling parameter for all initial conditions
outside a set of measure 0: the tree-SNE tree exists. This idea conceivably
extends to other attraction-repulsion methods and is illustrated on several
examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型在下游任务中表现出色，但预训练如何影响最终模型性能的机制尚不清楚。交叉熵损失不能很好地预测下游性能，需要新的理论视角。

Method: 提出覆盖度概念，量化预训练模型对高质量响应的概率分配。通过理论分析揭示覆盖度原理，并研究模型选择、梯度归一化和测试时解码等算法干预措施。

Result: 发现覆盖度比交叉熵能更快泛化，避免对序列长度等参数的虚假依赖。覆盖度是后训练和测试时缩放方法成功的必要且充分条件。

Conclusion: 覆盖度原理为理解预训练成功提供了新视角，覆盖度是预测下游性能的更好指标，提出的算法干预措施能有效提升覆盖度。

Abstract: Language models demonstrate remarkable abilities when pre-trained on large
text corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks, but how and why pre-training
shapes the success of the final model remains poorly understood. Notably,
although pre-training success is often quantified by cross entropy loss,
cross-entropy can be a poor predictor of downstream performance. Instead, we
provide a theoretical perspective on this relationship through the lens of
\emph{coverage}, which quantifies the probability mass the pre-trained model
places on high-quality responses and which is necessary and sufficient for
post-training and test-time scaling methods such as Best-of-N to succeed. Our
main results develop an understanding of \emph{the coverage principle}, a
phenomenon whereby next-token prediction implicitly optimizes toward a model
with good coverage. In particular, we uncover a mechanism that explains the
power of coverage in predicting downstream performance: \emph{coverage
generalizes faster than cross entropy}, avoiding spurious dependence on
problem-dependent parameters such as the sequence length. We also study
practical algorithmic interventions with provable benefits for improving
coverage, including (i) model/checkpoint selection procedures, (ii) gradient
normalization schemes, and (iii) test-time decoding strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型在数据增强时可能不尊重因果结构，导致干预鲁棒优化问题在标准Wasserstein距离下不连续，这凸显了使用符合因果结构的生成模型的重要性。

Method: 提出了一种新的归一化流架构，该架构满足因果结构模型的通用逼近性质，并能高效训练以最小化G-因果Wasserstein距离。

Result: 实证研究表明，该模型在因果回归和均值-方差投资组合优化的数据增强任务中，性能优于标准（非因果）生成模型。

Conclusion: 使用尊重因果结构的生成模型对于干预鲁棒优化问题至关重要，提出的新架构能有效解决这一问题并在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that interventionally robust optimization problems in
causal models are continuous under the $G$-causal Wasserstein distance, but may
be discontinuous under the standard Wasserstein distance. This highlights the
importance of using generative models that respect the causal structure when
augmenting data for such tasks. To this end, we propose a new normalizing flow
architecture that satisfies a universal approximation property for causal
structural models and can be efficiently trained to minimize the $G$-causal
Wasserstein distance. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model outperforms
standard (non-causal) generative models in data augmentation for causal
regression and mean-variance portfolio optimization in causal factor models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KSD估计器都只能达到√n收敛速率，但缺乏理论上的最优性证明，需要确定KSD估计的极小极大下界。

Method: 采用两种互补的证明策略：第一种针对ℝ^d空间上的Langevin-Stein算子和高斯核，第二种针对一般域上的KSD估计。

Result: 证明了KSD估计的极小极大下界为n^{-1/2}，且对于高斯核，估计难度随维度d呈指数增长。

Conclusion: 现有KSD估计器已达到最优收敛速率，为KSD理论提供了完整的极小极大分析框架。

Abstract: Kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
quantifying goodness-of-fit over the last decade, featuring numerous successful
applications. To the best of our knowledge, all existing KSD estimators with
known rate achieve $\sqrt n$-convergence. In this work, we present two
complementary results (with different proof strategies), establishing that the
minimax lower bound of KSD estimation is $n^{-1/2}$ and settling the optimality
of these estimators. Our first result focuses on KSD estimation on $\mathbb
R^d$ with the Langevin-Stein operator; our explicit constant for the Gaussian
kernel indicates that the difficulty of KSD estimation may increase
exponentially with the dimensionality $d$. Our second result settles the
minimax lower bound for KSD estimation on general domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Local PCA和CA-PCA的成功，希望开发一个更通用的流形维度估计框架，能够捕捉流形的局部图结构

Method: 提出结合PCA与回归技术的通用框架，包含两种具体实现：二次嵌入(QE)和总体最小二乘(TLS)

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，这些方法具有竞争力，且通常优于最先进的替代方法

Conclusion: 该框架为流形维度估计提供了有效的解决方案，QE和TLS方法在性能上超越了现有技术

Abstract: Local principal component analysis (Local PCA) has proven to be an effective
tool for estimating the intrinsic dimension of a manifold. More recently,
curvature-adjusted PCA (CA-PCA) has improved upon this approach by explicitly
accounting for the curvature of the underlying manifold, rather than assuming
local flatness. Building on these insights, we propose a general framework for
manifold dimension estimation that captures the manifold's local graph
structure by integrating PCA with regression-based techniques. Within this
framework, we introduce two representative estimators: quadratic embedding (QE)
and total least squares (TLS). Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that these methods perform competitively with, and often
outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives.

and exploitation, are critical for online decision-making. Existing approaches
typically assume no interference, where each individual's action affects only
their own reward. Yet, such an assumption can be violated in many practical
scenarios, and the oversight of interference can lead to short-sighted policies
that focus solely on maximizing the immediate outcomes for individuals, which
further results in suboptimal decisions and potentially increased regret over
time. To address this significant gap, we introduce the foresighted online
policy with interference (FRONT) that innovatively considers the long-term
impact of the current decision on subsequent decisions and rewards. The
proposed FRONT method employs a sequence of exploratory and exploitative
strategies to manage the intricacies of interference, ensuring robust parameter
inference and regret minimization. Theoretically, we establish a tail bound for
the online estimator and derive the asymptotic distribution of the parameters
of interest under suitable conditions on the interference network. We further
show that FRONT attains sublinear regret under two distinct definitions,
capturing both the immediate and consequential impacts of decisions, and we
establish these results with and without statistical inference. The
effectiveness of FRONT is further demonstrated through extensive simulations
and a real-world application to urban hotel profits.

Motivation: 迁移学习和过参数化模型在现代机器学习中都很重要，但它们的交集尚未被充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Abstract: Transfer learning is a key component of modern machine learning, enhancing
the performance of target tasks by leveraging diverse data sources.
Simultaneously, overparameterized models such as the minimum-$\ell_2$-norm
interpolator (MNI) in high-dimensional linear regression have garnered
significant attention for their remarkable generalization capabilities, a
property known as benign overfitting. Despite their individual importance, the
intersection of transfer learning and MNI remains largely unexplored. Our
research bridges this gap by proposing a novel two-step Transfer MNI approach
and analyzing its trade-offs. We characterize its non-asymptotic excess risk
and identify conditions under which it outperforms the target-only MNI. Our
analysis reveals free-lunch covariate shift regimes, where leveraging
heterogeneous data yields the benefit of knowledge transfer at limited cost. To
operationalize our findings, we develop a data-driven procedure to detect
informative sources and introduce an ensemble method incorporating multiple
informative Transfer MNIs. Finite-sample experiments demonstrate the robustness
of our methods to model and data heterogeneity, confirming their advantage.

### [210] [RankSEG-RMA: An Efficient Segmentation Algorithm via Reciprocal Moment Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15362)
*Zixun Wang,Ben Dai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出RankSEG-RMA方法，通过互逆矩近似降低RankSEG的计算复杂度，从O(d log d)和O(d²)降至O(d)，同时保持性能，并扩展适用于非重叠分割场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分割方法通常使用argmax或阈值处理概率图，但这种方法不能直接优化分割指标（如IoU和Dice），导致结果不一致或次优。RankSEG虽然能优化这些指标，但计算复杂度高且仅适用于重叠分割场景。

Method: 提出RankSEG-RMA方法，使用互逆矩近似来降低RankSEG的计算复杂度，同时开发像素级评分函数以支持非重叠分割场景的高效实现。

Result: RankSEG-RMA将RankDice和RankIoU的复杂度分别从O(d log d)和O(d²)降至O(d)，在LiTS数据集上预测时间从16.33秒降至接近argmax规则的0.01秒，同时保持可比较的性能。

Conclusion: RankSEG-RMA成功解决了RankSEG的计算复杂度和应用场景限制问题，为语义分割指标的直接优化提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation labels each pixel in an image with its corresponding
class, and is typically evaluated using the Intersection over Union (IoU) and
Dice metrics to quantify the overlap between predicted and ground-truth
segmentation masks. In the literature, most existing methods estimate
pixel-wise class probabilities, then apply argmax or thresholding to obtain the
final prediction. These methods have been shown to generally lead to
inconsistent or suboptimal results, as they do not directly maximize
segmentation metrics. To address this issue, a novel consistent segmentation
framework, RankSEG, has been proposed, which includes RankDice and RankIoU
specifically designed to optimize the Dice and IoU metrics, respectively.
Although RankSEG almost guarantees improved performance, it suffers from two
major drawbacks. First, it is its computational expense-RankDice has a
complexity of O(d log d) with a substantial constant factor (where d represents
the number of pixels), while RankIoU exhibits even higher complexity O(d^2),
thus limiting its practical application. For instance, in LiTS, prediction with
RankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule.
Second, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where
multiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard
benchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation. In this paper,
we overcome these two drawbacks via a reciprocal moment approximation (RMA) of
RankSEG with the following contributions: (i) we improve RankSEG using RMA,
namely RankSEG-RMA, reduces the complexity of both algorithms to O(d) while
maintaining comparable performance; (ii) inspired by RMA, we develop a
pixel-wise score function that allows efficient implementation for
non-overlapping segmentation settings.

Motivation: 现有核岭回归理论主要针对独立同分布数据，而现实数据往往具有结构化依赖关系，特别是在去噪分数学习等应用中，多个噪声观测来自共享的底层信号。

Method: 开发了新颖的块分解方法，能够对依赖数据进行精确的集中分析，推导出核岭回归的超额风险界限。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了核岭回归理论，同时为现代机器学习应用中分析依赖数据提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a foundational tool in machine learning,
with recent work emphasizing its connections to neural networks. However,
existing theory primarily addresses the i.i.d. setting, while real-world data
often exhibits structured dependencies - particularly in applications like
denoising score learning where multiple noisy observations derive from shared
underlying signals. We present the first systematic study of KRR generalization
for non-i.i.d. data with signal-noise causal structure, where observations
represent different noisy views of common signals. By developing a novel
blockwise decomposition method that enables precise concentration analysis for
dependent data, we derive excess risk bounds for KRR that explicitly depend on:
(1) the kernel spectrum, (2) causal structure parameters, and (3) sampling
mechanisms (including relative sample sizes for signals and noises). We further
apply our results to denoising score learning, establishing generalization
guarantees and providing principled guidance for sampling noisy data points.
This work advances KRR theory while providing practical tools for analyzing
dependent data in modern machine learning applications.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于高斯过程状态空间模型(GPSSM)的递归学习方法，通过异构多输出核、诱导点管理算法和统一递归推理框架，实现了在强非线性和显著噪声下的高效在线学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统通常具有多通道和高度非线性动态特性，传统建模方法难以应对。需要开发能够在线学习这些复杂系统动态的方法。

Method: 1. 设计异构多输出核，允许每个输出维度采用不同的核类型、超参数和输入变量；2. 开发诱导点管理算法，通过独立选择和修剪提高计算效率；3. 推导统一的递归推理框架，支持扩展卡尔曼滤波、无迹卡尔曼滤波和假设密度滤波等方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂非线性系统的在线学习提供了高效准确的解决方案，在计算效率和精度方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate learning of system dynamics is becoming increasingly crucial for
advanced control and decision-making in engineering. However, real-world
systems often exhibit multiple channels and highly nonlinear transition
dynamics, challenging traditional modeling methods. To enable online learning
for these systems, this paper formulates the system as Gaussian process
state-space models (GPSSMs) and develops a recursive learning method. The main
contributions are threefold. First, a heterogeneous multi-output kernel is
designed, allowing each output dimension to adopt distinct kernel types,
hyperparameters, and input variables, improving expressiveness in
multi-dimensional dynamics learning. Second, an inducing-point management
algorithm enhances computational efficiency through independent selection and
pruning for each output dimension. Third, a unified recursive inference
framework for GPSSMs is derived, supporting general moment matching approaches,
including the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and
assumed density filtering (ADF), enabling accurate learning under strong
nonlinearity and significant noise. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that the proposed method matches the accuracy of SOTA offline
GPSSMs with only 1/100 of the runtime, and surpasses SOTA online GPSSMs by
around 70% in accuracy under heavy noise while using only 1/20 of the runtime.

Abstract: Open world Machine Learning (OWML) aims to develop intelligent systems
capable of recognizing known categories, rejecting unknown samples, and
continually learning from novel information. Despite significant progress in
open set recognition, novelty detection, and continual learning, the field
still lacks a unified theoretical foundation that can quantify uncertainty,
characterize information transfer, and explain learning adaptability in
dynamic, nonstationary environments. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of information theoretic approaches in open world machine learning, emphasizing
how core concepts such as entropy, mutual information, and Kullback Leibler
divergence provide a mathematical language for describing knowledge
acquisition, uncertainty suppression, and risk control under open world
conditions. We synthesize recent studies into three major research axes:
information theoretic open set recognition enabling safe rejection of unknowns,
information driven novelty discovery guiding new concept formation, and
information retentive continual learning ensuring stable long term adaptation.
Furthermore, we discuss theoretical connections between information theory and
provable learning frameworks, including PAC Bayes bounds, open-space risk
theory, and causal information flow, to establish a pathway toward provable and
trustworthy open world intelligence. Finally, the review identifies key open
problems and future research directions, such as the quantification of
information risk, development of dynamic mutual information bounds, multimodal
information fusion, and integration of information theory with causal reasoning
and world model learning.

Motivation: 自适应实验产生依赖数据，打破了经典集中不等式所依赖的i.i.d.假设，使标准学习保证无效，需要开发适用于一般依赖数据的理论框架。

Method: 开发自归一化最大不等式，提出自适应样本方差惩罚程序平衡经验损失和样本方差，建立方差正则化悲观离策略学习目标，结合顺序更新。

Result: 在标准复杂度和边界条件下，所得估计器在参数和非参数情况下都实现了比1/√n基线更快的收敛速率，并通过数值模拟验证了实际增益。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法成功解决了依赖数据下的学习问题，提供了理论保证和实际性能提升，为自适应实验中的学习算法提供了新框架。

Abstract: Adaptive experiments produce dependent data that break i.i.d. assumptions
that underlie classical concentration bounds and invalidate standard learning
guarantees. In this paper, we develop a self-normalized maximal inequality for
martingale empirical processes. Building on this, we first propose an adaptive
sample-variance penalization procedure which balances empirical loss and sample
variance, valid for general dependent data. Next, this allows us to derive a
new variance-regularized pessimistic off-policy learning objective, for which
we establish excess-risk guarantees. Subsequently, we show that, when combined
with sequential updates and under standard complexity and margin conditions,
the resulting estimator achieves fast convergence rates in both parametric and
nonparametric regimes, improving over the usual $1/\sqrt{n}$
  baseline. We complement our theoretical findings with numerical simulations
that illustrate the practical gains of our approach.

TL;DR: 该论文为变分推断的收敛性分析建立了一个新的理论框架，通过利用指数族分布的结构，将负ELBO表示为关于对数配分函数的Bregman散度，从而能够对优化景观进行几何分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分推断为贝叶斯推断提供了可扩展的框架，但由于目标函数在欧几里得空间中的非凸性和非光滑性，收敛性分析仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 利用指数族分布结构，将负ELBO表示为Bregman散度，通过推导参数空间中射线上的目标函数边界，建立由Fisher信息矩阵谱特性控制的属性。

Result: 在该几何框架下，证明了具有恒定和递减步长的梯度下降算法的非渐近收敛速率。

Conclusion: 该Bregman表示允许弱单调性特性，虽然比凸性弱，但为严格的收敛性分析提供了足够的结构。

Abstract: Variational Inference (VI) provides a scalable framework for Bayesian
inference by optimizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), but convergence
analysis remains challenging due to the objective's non-convexity and
non-smoothness in Euclidean space. We establish a novel theoretical framework
for analyzing VI convergence by exploiting the exponential family structure of
distributions. We express negative ELBO as a Bregman divergence with respect to
the log-partition function, enabling a geometric analysis of the optimization
landscape. We show that this Bregman representation admits a weak monotonicity
property that, while weaker than convexity, provides sufficient structure for
rigorous convergence analysis. By deriving bounds on the objective function
along rays in parameter space, we establish properties governed by the spectral
characteristics of the Fisher information matrix. Under this geometric
framework, we prove non-asymptotic convergence rates for gradient descent
algorithms with both constant and diminishing step sizes.

Motivation: 需要有效的方法来评估和优化条件序列模型（特别是计算生物学中的模型）的性能，传统方法可能不足以准确衡量模型与真实条件分布的匹配程度。

Method: 提出Augmented Conditional Maximum Mean Discrepancy (ACMMD)作为新的分布差异度量，基于核方法构建，能够从模型采样中无偏估计，用于假设检验和超参数调优。

Result: 应用该方法分析ProteinMPNN蛋白质设计模型，能够拒绝该模型对某些蛋白质家族数据拟合的假设，并通过调整温度超参数获得更好的拟合效果。

Conclusion: ACMMD提供了一种有效的工具来评估条件序列模型的绝对拟合度，并在实际应用中展示了其在模型诊断和超参数优化方面的实用性。

Abstract: We propose a set of kernel-based tools to evaluate the designs and tune the
hyperparameters of conditional sequence models, with a focus on problems in
computational biology. The backbone of our tools is a new measure of
discrepancy between the true conditional distribution and the model's estimate,
called the Augmented Conditional Maximum Mean Discrepancy (ACMMD). Provided
that the model can be sampled from, the ACMMD can be estimated unbiasedly from
data to quantify absolute model fit, integrated within hypothesis tests, and
used to evaluate model reliability. We demonstrate the utility of our approach
by analyzing a popular protein design model, ProteinMPNN. We are able to reject
the hypothesis that ProteinMPNN fits its data for various protein families, and
tune the model's temperature hyperparameter to achieve a better fit.

Motivation: 传统VAE使用单个连续潜在空间学习解缠表示，本文探索使用离散潜在变量组合多个源的特征表示，特别适用于声学数据等线性组合场景。

Method: 基于源组合的显式模型，使用线性组合模型，推导MS-VAE的推理和学习方程，在数字叠加和说话人日志任务中验证方法。

Conclusion: MS-VAE是一种领域无关的方法，能够有效分离多个源，在源分离任务中表现出色，特别在说话人日志等应用中具有优势。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a leading approach to address the problem
of learning disentangled representations. Typically a single VAE is used and
disentangled representations are sought in its continuous latent space. Here we
explore a different approach by using discrete latents to combine
VAE-representations of individual sources. The combination is done based on an
explicit model for source combination, and we here use a linear combination
model which is well suited, e.g., for acoustic data. We formally define such a
multi-stream VAE (MS-VAE) approach, derive its inference and learning
equations, and we numerically investigate its principled functionality. The
MS-VAE is domain-agnostic, and we here explore its ability to separate sources
into different streams using superimposed hand-written digits, and mixed
acoustic sources in a speaker diarization task. We observe a clear separation
of digits, and on speaker diarization we observe an especially low rate of
missed speakers. Numerical experiments further highlight the flexibility of the
approach across varying amounts of supervision and training data.

Conclusion: 深度和读出层是实现等变神经网络普适性的关键机制，为先前专门结果提供了统一视角并进行了扩展。

Abstract: Universality results for equivariant neural networks remain rare. Those that
do exist typically hold only in restrictive settings: either they rely on
regular or higher-order tensor representations, leading to impractically
high-dimensional hidden spaces, or they target specialized architectures, often
confined to the invariant setting. This work develops a more general account.
For invariant networks, we establish a universality theorem under separation
constraints, showing that the addition of a fully connected readout layer
secures approximation within the class of separation-constrained continuous
functions. For equivariant networks, where results are even scarcer, we
demonstrate that standard separability notions are inadequate and introduce the
sharper criterion of $\textit{entry-wise separability}$. We show that with
sufficient depth or with the addition of appropriate readout layers,
equivariant networks attain universality within the entry-wise separable
regime. Together with prior results showing the failure of universality for
shallow models, our findings identify depth and readout layers as a decisive
mechanism for universality, additionally offering a unified perspective that
subsumes and extends earlier specialized results.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) has become a widely used framework in
applied sciences for estimating the parameters of stochastic models that best
explain experimental observations. A central question in this setting is how to
effectively combine multiple observations in order to improve parameter
inference and obtain sharper posterior distributions. Recent advances in
score-based diffusion methods address this problem by constructing a
compositional score, obtained by aggregating individual posterior scores within
the diffusion process. While it is natural to suspect that the accumulation of
individual errors may significantly degrade sampling quality as the number of
observations grows, this important theoretical issue has so far remained
unexplored. In this paper, we study the compositional score produced by the
GAUSS algorithm of Linhart et al. (2024) and establish an upper bound on its
mean squared error in terms of both the individual score errors and the number
of observations. We illustrate our theoretical findings on a Gaussian example,
where all analytical expressions can be derived in a closed form.

tradeoffs. We then construct coverage and efficiency objectives under potential

approachability strategy to achieve these goals. The resulting algorithm enjoys
strong theoretical guarantees and provides practical insights, though its
computational burden may limit deployment in practice.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了模型不确定性下保险公司的稳健定价策略如何影响动态保险市场竞争均衡，发现稳健定价导致保费和股权估值显著上升，保险承保周期延长，流动性管理更加保守。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着新兴风险的出现，模型不确定性给保险业带来根本性挑战，使得稳健定价成为首要问题。研究旨在了解保险公司稳健偏好如何塑造动态保险市场的竞争均衡。

Method: 保险公司优化其承保和流动性管理策略以最大化股东价值，通过分析推导和数值求解得出均衡结果。

Result: 相比无模型不确定性的基准情形，稳健保险定价导致保费和股权估值显著提高；承保能力的最小值、最大值和可接受范围均扩大；预期承保周期长度大幅增加；虽然承保能力过程在长期仍具有遍历性，但稳态密度更集中于低能力状态。

Conclusion: 这些发现为近期对承保周期经验证据的怀疑提供了潜在解释，表明此类周期确实存在但比以前假设的要长得多。

Abstract: With the rise of emerging risks, model uncertainty poses a fundamental
challenge in the insurance industry, making robust pricing a first-order
question. This paper investigates how insurers' robustness preferences shape
competitive equilibrium in a dynamic insurance market. Insurers optimize their
underwriting and liquidity management strategies to maximize shareholder value,
leading to equilibrium outcomes that can be analytically derived and
numerically solved. Compared to a benchmark without model uncertainty, robust
insurance pricing results in significantly higher premiums and equity
valuations. Notably, our model yields three novel insights: (1) The minimum,
maximum, and admissible range of aggregate capacity all expand, indicating that
insurers' liquidity management becomes more conservative. (2) The expected
length of the underwriting cycle increases substantially, far exceeding the
range commonly reported in earlier empirical studies. (3) While the capacity
process remains ergodic in the long run, the stationary density becomes more
concentrated in low-capacity states, implying that liquidity-constrained
insurers require longer to recover. Together, these findings provide a
potential explanation for recent skepticism regarding the empirical evidence of
underwriting cycles, suggesting that such cycles may indeed exist but are
considerably longer than previously assumed.

Abstract: The Koopman operator, originally defined for dynamical systems without input,
has inspired many applications in control. Yet, the theoretical foundations
underpinning this progress in control remain underdeveloped. This paper
investigates the theoretical structure and connections between two extensions
of Koopman theory to control: (i) Koopman operator via infinite input sequences
and (ii) the Koopman control family. Although these frameworks encode system
information in fundamentally different ways, we show that under certain
conditions on the function spaces they operate on, they are equivalent. The
equivalence is both in terms of the actions of the Koopman-based formulations
in each framework as well as the function values on the system trajectories.
Our analysis provides constructive tools to translate between the frameworks,

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stability of a triangularly coupled triple
loop thermosyphon system with momentum and heat exchange at the coupling point
as well as the existence of disturbances. The controller consists of a single,
local state feedback. From the stability analysis, we obtain explicit bounds on
the feedback gains, which depend on the Rayleigh numbers and the momentum
coupling parameter, but independent of the thermal coupling parameter. The
existence of the stability bounds allows us to design decentralized adaptive
controllers to automatically search for the feasible gains when the system
parameters are unknown. In the case of existing disturbances in the system, we
approximate the disturbances via an extended state observer for the purpose of
disturbance rejection. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the
performance of the proposed decentralized disturbance rejection controller
design.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统场景缩减方法在尾部风险保持和问题特定代表性方面的不足

Abstract: Scenario reduction (SR) alleviates the computational complexity of
scenario-based stochastic optimization with conditional value-at-risk
(SBSO-CVaR) by identifying representative scenarios to depict the underlying
uncertainty and tail risks. Existing distribution-driven SR methods emphasize
statistical similarity but often exclude extreme scenarios, leading to weak
tail-risk awareness and insufficient problem-specific representativeness.
Instead, this paper proposes an iterative problem-driven scenario reduction
framework. Specifically, we integrate the SBSO-CVaR problem structure into SR
process and project the original scenario set from the distribution space onto
the problem space. Subsequently, to minimize the SR optimality gap with
acceptable computation complexity, we propose a tractable iterative
problem-driven scenario reduction (IPDSR) method that selects representative
scenarios that best approximate the optimality distribution of the original
scenario set while preserving tail risks. Furthermore, the iteration process is
rendered as a mixed-integer program to enable scenario partitioning and
representative scenarios selection. And ex-post problem-driven evaluation
indices are proposed to evaluate the SR performance. Numerical experiments show
IPDSR significantly outperforms existing SR methods by achieving an optimality
gap of less than 1% within an acceptable computation time.

Abstract: We consider the minimisation problem of submodular functions and investigate
the application of a zeroth-order method to this problem. The method is based
on exploiting a Gaussian smoothing random oracle to estimate the smoothed
function gradient. We prove the convergence of the algorithm to a global
$\epsilon$-approximate solution in the offline case and show that the algorithm
is Hannan-consistent in the online case with respect to static regret.
Moreover, we show that the algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{NP_N^\ast})$ dynamic
regret, where $N$ is the number of iterations and $P_N^\ast$ is the path
length. The complexity analysis and hyperparameter selection are presented for
all the cases. The theoretical results are illustrated via numerical examples.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization (BLO) offers a principled framework for hierarchical
decision-making and has been widely applied in machine learning tasks such as
hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. While existing BLO methods are
mostly developed in Euclidean spaces, many real-world problems involve
structural constraints. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian bilevel
optimization (RBLO) algorithm that incorporates a bilevel descent aggregation
(BDA) scheme to jointly coordinate upper- and lower-level updates. Concretely,
first we abstract the constraints in the BLO to a manifold structure and then
transform the constrained BLO be a unconstrained RBLO problem. Second, to
address limitations of existing RBLO methods, particularly the restrictive
assumptions required for convergence, we reformulate the bilevel problem using
smooth manifold mappings and provide a convergence analysis under the
conditions of geodesic convexity and Lipschitz smoothness. Finally, we recall
the multi-view hypergraph spectral clustering task, and evaluate the proposed
approach on 3sources data sets. The numerical results validate the superior
performance over Euclidean and manifold-based baselines.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a standard approach for sample-efficient global
optimisation of expensive black-box functions, yet its scalability to high
dimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate nonlinear dimensionality
reduction techniques that reduce the problem to a sequence of low-dimensional
Latent-Space BO (LSBO). While early LSBO methods used (linear) random
projections (Wang et al., 2013), building on Grosnit et al. (2021), we employ
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for LSBO, focusing on deep metric loss for
structured latent manifolds and VAE retraining to adapt the encoder-decoder to
newly sampled regions. We propose some changes in their implementation,
originally designed for tasks such as molecule generation, and reformulate the
algorithm for broader optimisation purposes. We then couple LSBO with
Sequential Domain Reduction (SDR) directly in the latent space (SDR-LSBO),
yielding an algorithm that narrows the latent search domains as evidence
accumulates. Implemented in a GPU-accelerated BoTorch stack with Matern-5/2
Gaussian process surrogates, our numerical results show improved optimisation
quality across benchmark tasks and that structured latent manifolds improve BO
performance. Additionally, we compare random embeddings and VAEs as two
mechanisms for dimensionality reduction, showing that the latter outperforms
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to combine
SDR with VAE-based LSBO, and our analysis clarifies design choices for metric
shaping and retraining that are critical for scalable latent space BO. For
reproducibility, our source code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架为不确定性下的鲁棒决策提供了统一、可扩展和规范的方法，有效桥接了数据驱动学习和优化

Abstract: Traditional end-to-end contextual robust optimization models are trained for
specific contextual data, requiring complete retraining whenever new contextual
information arrives. This limitation hampers their use in online
decision-making problems such as energy scheduling, where multiperiod
optimization must be solved every few minutes. In this paper, we propose a
novel Data-Driven Contextual Uncertainty Set, which gives rise to a new
End-to-End Data-Driven Contextual Robust Optimization model. For
right-hand-side uncertainty, we introduce a reformulation scheme that enables
the development of a variant of the Column-and-Constraint Generation (CCG)
algorithm. This new CCG method explicitly considers the contextual vector
within the cut expressions, allowing previously generated cuts to remain valid
for new contexts, thereby significantly accelerating convergence in online
applications. Numerical experiments on energy and reserve scheduling problems,
based on classical test cases and large-scale networks (with more than 10,000
nodes), demonstrate that the proposed method reduces computation times and
operational costs while capturing context-dependent risk structures. The
proposed framework (model and method), therefore, offers a unified, scalable,
and prescriptive approach to robust decision-making under uncertainty,
effectively bridging data-driven learning and optimization.

Main category: math.OC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二阶方法虽然收敛快，但由于Hessian计算和分解成本远高于梯度计算，在实践中很少使用。需要一种方法来克服这个瓶颈。

Method: 采用分离客户端框架，让梯度和曲率由不同的客户端异步计算，捕捉了实际延迟和不精确的Hessian更新，同时避免了Lazy Hessian方法需要的手动调参。

Result: 该方法保持了强收敛保证，实现了理论上的时钟速度提升√τ倍（τ是Hessian计算相对于梯度计算的时间比）。在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，异步曲率方法始终优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 分离客户端框架有效解决了二阶方法的高计算成本问题，在保持二阶精度的同时实现了显著的性能提升，特别适用于高维问题。

Abstract: Second-order methods promise faster convergence but are rarely used in
practice because Hessian computations and decompositions are far more expensive
than gradients. We propose a \emph{split-client} framework where gradients and
curvature are computed asynchronously by separate clients. This abstraction
captures realistic delays and inexact Hessian updates while avoiding the manual
tuning required by Lazy Hessian methods. Focusing on cubic regularization, we
show that our approach retains strong convergence guarantees and achieves a
provable wall-clock speedup of order $\sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the
relative time needed to compute and decompose the Hessian compared to a
gradient step. Since $\tau$ can be orders of magnitude larger than one in
high-dimensional problems, this improvement is practically significant.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm the theory: asynchronous
curvature consistently outperforms vanilla and Lazy Hessian baselines, while
maintaining second-order accuracy.

Abstract: Algorithms for continuous optimization problems have a rich history of design
and innovation over the past several decades, in which mathematical analysis of
their convergence and complexity properties plays a central role. Besides their
theoretical properties, optimization algorithms are interesting also for their
practical usefulness as computational tools for solving real-world problems.
There are often gaps between the practical performance of an algorithm and what
can be proved about it. These two facets of the field -- the theoretical and
the practical -- interact in fascinating ways, each driving innovation in the
other. This work focuses on the development of algorithms in two areas --
linear programming and unconstrained minimization of smooth functions --
outlining major algorithm classes in each area along with their theoretical
properties and practical performance, and highlighting how advances in theory
and practice have influenced each other in these areas. In discussing theory,
we focus mainly on non-asymptotic complexity, which are upper bounds on the
amount of computation required by a given algorithm to find an approximate
solution of problems in a given class.

Abstract: The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem is a non-convex, NP-hard
optimization task essential for secure and economic power system operation. Two
prominent solution strategies are interior-point methods, valued for
computational efficiency, and spatial branching techniques, which provide
global optimality guarantees at higher computational cost. In this work, we
also explore data-boosted variants that leverage historical operating data to
enhance performance by guiding initialization in interior-point methods or
constraining the search region in spatial branching. We conduct a comprehensive
empirical comparison across networks of varying sizes and under both standard
benchmark conditions and modified configurations designed to induce local
optima. Our results show that data-boosted strategies can improve convergence
and reduce computation times for both approaches. Spatial branching, however,
remains computationally demanding, requiring further development for practical
application. In contrast, modern interior-point solvers exhibit remarkable
robustness, often converging to the global optimum even in challenging
instances with multiple local solutions.

Abstract: Chance-constrained programming is a widely used framework for decision-making
under uncertainty, yet its mixed-integer reformulations involve nonconvex
mixing sets with a knapsack constraint, leading to weak relaxations and
computational challenges. Most existing approaches for strengthening the
relaxations of these sets rely primarily on extensions of a specific class of
valid inequalities, limiting both convex hull coverage and the discovery of
fundamentally new structures. In this paper, we develop a novel convexification
framework that reformulates chance-constrained sets as bilinear sets over a
simplex in a lifted space and employs a step-by-step aggregation procedure to
derive facet-defining inequalities in the original space of variables. Our
approach generalizes and unifies established families of valid inequalities in
the literature while introducing new ones that capture substantially larger
portions of the convex hull. Main contributions include: (i) the development of
a new aggregation-based convexification technique for bilinear sets over a
simplex in a lower-dimensional space; (ii) the introduction of a novel bilinear
reformulation of mixing sets with a knapsack constraint -- arising from
single-row relaxations of chance constraints -- over a simplex, which enables
the systematic derivation of strong inequalities in the original variable
space; and (iii) the characterization of facet-defining inequalities within a
unified framework that contains both existing and new families. Preliminary
computational experiments demonstrate that our inequalities describe over 90\%
of the facet-defining inequalities of the convex hull of benchmark instances,
significantly strengthening existing relaxations and advancing the polyhedral
understanding of chance-constrained programs.

Abstract: In quantitative investing, return prediction supports various tasks,
including stock selection, portfolio optimization, and risk management.
Quantitative factors, such as valuation, quality, and growth, capture various
characteristics of stocks. Unstructured financial data, like news and
transcripts, has attracted growing attention, driven by recent advances in
large language models (LLMs). This paper examines effective methods for
leveraging multimodal factors and newsflow in return prediction and stock
selection. First, we introduce a fusion learning framework to learn a unified
representation from factors and newsflow representations generated by an LLM.
Within this framework, we compare three representative methods: representation
combination, representation summation, and attentive representations. Next,
building on empirical observations from fusion learning, we explore the mixture
model that adaptively combines predictions made by single modalities and their
fusion. To mitigate the training instability observed in the mixture model, we
introduce a decoupled training approach with theoretical insights. Finally, our
experiments on real investment universes yield several insights into effective
multimodal modeling of factors and news for stock return prediction.
