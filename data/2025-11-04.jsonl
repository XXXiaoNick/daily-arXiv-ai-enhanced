The use of RL for optimal trading\nstrategies that exploit latent information in the market is, to the best of our\nknowledge, not widely tackled. In this paper we study an optimal trading\nproblem, where a trading signal follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with\nregime-switching dynamics. We employ a blend of RL and Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNN) in order to make the most at extracting underlying information\nfrom the trading signal with latent parameters.\n  The latent parameters driving mean reversion, speed, and volatility are\nfiltered from observations of the signal, and trading strategies are derived\nvia RL. To address this problem, we propose three Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG)-based algorithms that integrate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\nnetworks to capture temporal dependencies in the signal. The first, a one -step\napproach (hid-DDPG), directly encodes hidden states from the GRU into the RL\ntrader. The second and third are two-step methods: one (prob-DDPG) makes use of\nposterior regime probability estimates, while the other (reg-DDPG) relies on\nforecasts of the next signal value. Through extensive simulations with\nincreasingly complex Markovian regime dynamics for the trading signal's\nparameters, as well as an empirical application to equity pair trading, we find\nthat prob-DDPG achieves superior cumulative rewards and exhibits more\ninterpretable strategies. By contrast, reg-DDPG provides limited benefits,\nwhile hid-DDPG offers intermediate performance with less interpretable\nstrategies.

In this context, our study focused on a parallel\nmonetary system based on a redeemable self-decay/devalued money(RSDM). Firstly,\nwe point out the idea of redeeming gold at a fixed denomination with gold\ncertificates is similar to an impossible perpetual motion machine. Only when\nthe face value of a gold token self-decays or self-depreciates and the weight\nof the reduced value can compensate for the storage cost of physical gold, can\nit be convertible or redeemable.

We employ a blend of RL and Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNN) in order to make the most at extracting underlying information\nfrom the trading signal with latent parameters.\n  The latent parameters driving mean reversion, speed, and volatility are\nfiltered from observations of the signal, and trading strategies are derived\nvia RL. To address this problem, we propose three Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG)-based algorithms that integrate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\nnetworks to capture temporal dependencies in the signal. The first, a one -step\napproach (hid-DDPG), directly encodes hidden states from the GRU into the RL\ntrader. The second and third are two-step methods: one (prob-DDPG) makes use of\nposterior regime probability estimates, while the other (reg-DDPG) relies on\nforecasts of the next signal value. Through extensive simulations with\nincreasingly complex Markovian regime dynamics for the trading signal's\nparameters, as well as an empirical application to equity pair trading, we find\nthat prob-DDPG achieves superior cumulative rewards and exhibits more\ninterpretable strategies.

Findings from a Mixed-Methods Study on the Post-production Design Change Process of Navy Assets", "comment": null, "summary": "Complex engineered systems routinely face schedule and cost overruns, along\nwith poor post-deployment performance. Championed by both INCOSE and the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD), the systems engineering (SE) community has\nincreasingly looked to Digital Engineering (DE) as a potential remedy. Despite\nthis growing advocacy, most of DE's purported benefits remain anecdotal, and\nits return on investment (ROI) remains poorly understood. This research\npresents findings from a case study on a Navy SE team responsible for the\npreliminary design phase of post-production design change projects for Navy\nassets. Using a mixed-methods approach, we document why complex system\nsustainment projects are routinely late, where and to what extent schedule\nslips arise, and how a DE transformation could improve schedule adherence. This\nstudy makes three contributions. First, it identifies four archetypical\ninefficiency modes that drive schedule overruns and explains how these\nmechanisms unfold in their organizational context. Second, it quantifies the\nmagnitude and variation of schedule slips. Third, it creates a hypothetical\ndigitally transformed version of the current process, aligned with DoD DE\npolicy, and compares it to the current state to estimate potential schedule\ngains. Our findings suggest that a DE transformation could reduce the median\nproject duration by 50.1% and reduce the standard deviation by 41.5%, leading\nto faster and more predictable timelines. However, the observed gains are not\nuniform across task categories. Overall, this study provides initial\nquantitative evidence of DE's potential ROI and its value in improving the\nefficiency and predictability of complex system sustainment projects."}

Theoretically, we demonstrate that\nTransit-MP, while using different traffic state measures for upstream and\ndownstream links for pressure calculation, still achieves road network\nstability even in partially CV environments.

On the other hand, neural MTPPs models forego\nthis interpretability in favor of absolute predictive performance. In this\nwork, we present a new family MTPP models: the hyper Hawkes process (HHP),\nwhich aims to be as flexible and performant as neural MTPPs, while retaining\ninterpretable aspects. To achieve this, the HHP extends the classical Hawkes\nprocess to increase its expressivity by first expanding the dimension of the\nprocess into a latent space, and then introducing a hypernetwork to allow time-\nand data-dependent dynamics. These extensions define a highly performant MTPP\nfamily, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmark\ntasks and metrics. Furthermore, by retaining the linearity of the recurrence,\nalbeit now piecewise and conditionally linear, the HHP also retains much of the\nstructure of the original Hawkes process, which we exploit to create direct\nprobes into how the model creates predictions. HHP models therefore offer both\nstate-of-the-art predictions, while also providing an opportunity to ``open the\nbox'' and inspect how predictions were generated."}

During the pandemic, we have observed a spike in\ncases related to mental health, such as anxiety, stress, and depression.\nDepression significantly influences most diseases worldwide, making it\ndifficult to detect mental health conditions in people due to unawareness and\nunwillingness to consult a doctor. However, nowadays, people extensively use\nonline social media platforms to express their emotions and thoughts. Hence,\nsocial media platforms are now becoming a large data source that can be\nutilized for detecting depression and mental illness. However, existing\napproaches often overlook data sparsity in tweets and the multimodal aspects of\nsocial media. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework that\ncombines textual, user-specific, and image analysis to detect depression among\nsocial media users. To provide enough context about the user's emotional state,\nwe propose (i) an extrinsic feature by harnessing the URLs present in tweets\nand (ii) extracting textual content present in images posted in tweets. We also\nextract five sets of features belonging to different modalities to describe a\nuser. Additionally, we introduce a Deep Learning model, the Visual Neural\nNetwork (VNN), to generate embeddings of user-posted images, which are used to\ncreate the visual feature vector for prediction.

It is motivated by the rapidly evolving field of\nalgorithmic fairness where new metrics, mitigation strategies, and machine\nlearning methods continuously emerge. A central challenge in fairness, but also\nfar beyond, is that existing toolkits either focus narrowly on single\ninterventions or treat reproducibility and extensibility as secondary\nconsiderations rather than core design principles. flowengineR addresses this\nby introducing a unified architecture of standardized engines for data\nsplitting, execution, preprocessing, training, inprocessing, postprocessing,\nevaluation, and reporting. Each engine encapsulates one methodological task yet\ncommunicates via a lightweight interface, ensuring workflows remain\ntransparent, auditable, and easily extensible. Although implemented in R,\nflowengineR builds on ideas from workflow languages (CWL, YAWL), graph-oriented\nvisual programming languages (KNIME), and R frameworks (BatchJobs, batchtools).\nIts emphasis, however, is less on orchestrating engines for resilient parallel\nexecution but rather on the straightforward setup and management of distinct\nengines as data structures. This orthogonalization enables distributed\nresponsibilities, independent development, and streamlined integration. In\nfairness context, by structuring fairness methods as interchangeable engines,\nflowengineR lets researchers integrate, compare, and evaluate interventions\nacross the modeling pipeline. At the same time, the architecture generalizes to\nexplainability, robustness, and compliance metrics without core modifications.\nWhile motivated by fairness, it ultimately provides a general infrastructure\nfor any workflow context where reproducibility, transparency, and extensibility\nare essential."}

The use of RL for optimal trading\nstrategies that exploit latent information in the market is, to the best of our\nknowledge, not widely tackled. In this paper we study an optimal trading\nproblem, where a trading signal follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with\nregime-switching dynamics. We employ a blend of RL and Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNN) in order to make the most at extracting underlying information\nfrom the trading signal with latent parameters.\n  The latent parameters driving mean reversion, speed, and volatility are\nfiltered from observations of the signal, and trading strategies are derived\nvia RL. To address this problem, we propose three Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG)-based algorithms that integrate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\nnetworks to capture temporal dependencies in the signal. The first, a one -step\napproach (hid-DDPG), directly encodes hidden states from the GRU into the RL\ntrader. The second and third are two-step methods: one (prob-DDPG) makes use of\nposterior regime probability estimates, while the other (reg-DDPG) relies on\nforecasts of the next signal value. Through extensive simulations with\nincreasingly complex Markovian regime dynamics for the trading signal's\nparameters, as well as an empirical application to equity pair trading, we find\nthat prob-DDPG achieves superior cumulative rewards and exhibits more\ninterpretable strategies. By contrast, reg-DDPG provides limited benefits,\nwhile hid-DDPG offers intermediate performance with less interpretable\nstrategies.

To quantify the behavioral effects of such\ninterventions in a freely moving mouse, we developed a dual-channel magnetic\nchamber, specifically designed for rate-sensitive magnetothermal-genetic\nstimulation, and adaptable for other uses of alternating magnetic fields.\nThrough an optimized coil design, the system allows independent control of two\nspatially orthogonal uniform magnetic fields delivered at different frequencies\nwithin a 10 cm x 10 cm x 6 cm chamber. The two channels have nominal\nfrequencies of 50 and 550 kHz with peak magnetic field strengths of 88 and 12.5\nmT, achieved with resonant coil drives having peak voltages of 1.6 and 1.8 kV\nand currents of 1.0 and 0.26 kA, respectively. Additionally, a liquid cooling\nsystem enables magnetic field generation for second-level duration, and an\nobservation port and camera allow video capture of the animal's behavior within\nthe chamber. The system generates high-amplitude magnetic fields across two\nwidely separated frequency channels with negligible interference (< 1%).\nRelatively uniform magnetic field distribution (+/-10% across 94% of the\nchamber volume) is maintained throughout the chamber, and temperature increase\nof the inner side of the coil enclosure during the operation is limited to <\n0.35 {\\deg}C/s to ensure in vivo safety.

One promising\napproach is layer-wise optimization, which treats each transformer block as a\nsingle layer and optimizes it sequentially, while freezing the other layers to\nsave optimizer states and activations. Although effective, these methods ignore\nthe varying importance of the modules within each layer, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. Moreover, layer-wise sampling provides only limited memory\nsavings, as at least one full layer must remain active during optimization. To\novercome these limitations, we propose Module-wise Importance SAmpling (MISA),\na novel method that divides each layer into smaller modules and assigns\nimportance scores to each module. MISA uses a weighted random sampling\nmechanism to activate modules, provably reducing gradient variance compared to\nlayer-wise sampling.

To prove this, we consider an inf-compact perturbation to the\nrunning cost over the entire space such that the resulting ergodic risk\nsensitive control problem is well-defined and then use the corresponding\nexisting results. The heart of the analysis lies in exploiting the variational\nformula of exponential functionals of Brownian motion and applying it to the\nobjective exponential cost function of the controlled diffusion. This\nrepresentation facilitates us to view the risk sensitive cost for any\nstationary Markov control as the optimal value of a control problem of an\nextended diffusion involving a new auxiliary control where the optimal\ncriterion is to maximize the associated long-run average cost criterion that is\na difference of the original running cost and an extra term that is quadratic\nin the auxiliary control.

In fact, we also show that the\nnegative-entropy is inherently non-adaptive to sparsity: it provably incurs\nregret scaling with $\\sqrt{\\log S}$ on sparse problems. Instead, we propose a\nfamily of $\\ell_r$-norm regularizers ($r \\in (1,2)$) that adapts to the\nsparsity and achieves regret scaling with $\\sqrt{\\log M}$ instead of\n$\\sqrt{\\log SA}$. We show this is optimal via a matching lower bound,\nhighlighting that $M$ captures the effective dimension of the problem instead\nof $SA$.

This work, to our knowledge, is the\nfirst to bridge the gap between RLVR LLM training with the critical, real-world\nforecasting challenges in public transit operations. We adapt RLVR to this task\nby introducing a tolerance-based, shaped reward function that grants partial\ncredit within a continuous error margin, rather than demanding a single correct\nanswer.

In practice, however, previously unseen or unknown fault types\n(i.e., out-of-distribution or open-set observations not present during\ntraining) can occur, causing such methods to fail and posing a significant\nchallenge to their widespread industrial deployment. To address this challenge,\nthis paper proposes a semi-supervised open-set fault diagnosis (SOFD) framework\nthat enhances and extends the applicability of deep learning models in open-set\nfault diagnosis scenarios. The framework includes a reliability subset\nconstruction process, which uses a multi-layer fusion feature representation\nextracted by a supervised feature learning model to select an unlabeled test\nsubset. The labeled training set and pseudo-labeled test subset are then fed\ninto a semi-supervised diagnosis model to learn discriminative features for\neach class, enabling accurate classification of known faults and effective\ndetection of unknown samples.

These limitations reveal the weakness of the\nprevailing \"one-model-fits-all\" paradigm, particularly in safety-critical urban\ncontexts where simpler physics-based models can occasionally outperform\nadvanced networks (Kalman, 1960). To bridge this gap, we propose a dynamic\nmulti-expert gating framework that adaptively selects the most reliable\ntrajectory predictor among a physics-informed LSTM, a Transformer, and a\nfine-tuned GameFormer on a per-sample basis.\n  Our method leverages internal model signals (meta-features) such as stability\nand uncertainty (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016), which we demonstrate to be\nsubstantially more informative than geometric scene descriptors. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first work to formulate trajectory expert selection\nas a pairwise-ranking problem over internal model signals (Burges et al.,\n2005), directly optimizing decision quality without requiring post-hoc\ncalibration.\n  Evaluated on the nuPlan-mini dataset (Caesar et al., 2021) with 1,287\nsamples, our LLM-enhanced tri-expert gate achieves a Final Displacement Error\n(FDE) of 2.567 m, representing a 9.5 percent reduction over GameFormer (2.835\nm), and realizes 57.8 percent of the oracle performance bound. In open-loop\nsimulations, after trajectory horizon alignment, the same configuration reduces\nFDE on left-turn scenarios by approximately 10 percent, demonstrating\nconsistent improvements across both offline validation and open-loop\nevaluation. These results indicate that adaptive hybrid systems enhance\ntrajectory reliability in safety-critical autonomous driving, providing a\npractical pathway beyond static single-model paradigms."}

This review examines this convergence across three\nprinciples: automaticity, in which responses emerge from associative rather\nthan deliberative processes; suppressed monitoring, leading to errors such as\nconfabulation in hypnosis and hallucination in LLMs; and heightened contextual\ndependency, where immediate cues (for example, the suggestion of a therapist or\nthe prompt of the user) override stable knowledge.\n  These mechanisms reveal an observer-relative meaning gap: both systems\nproduce coherent but ungrounded outputs that require an external interpreter to\nsupply meaning. Hypnosis and LLMs also exemplify functional agency - the\ncapacity for complex, goal-directed, context-sensitive behavior - without\nsubjective agency, the conscious awareness of intention and ownership that\ndefines human action. This distinction clarifies how purposive behavior can\nemerge without self-reflective consciousness, governed instead by structural\nand contextual dynamics.

While full fine-tuning is a powerful\nadaptation method, it is computationally expensive and can lead to a\ndegradation of general reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic\nforgetting. A range of alternative techniques exists, each with its own\ntrade-offs. In-Context Learning (ICL) is fast but limited by context length,\nwhile Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) offer a middle ground by minimizing parameter changes.

The agent learns a policy to strategically seek external visual\nevidence to support its diagnostic reasoning. This policy is optimized using\nreinforcement learning, resulting in a model that is both efficient and\ngeneralizable. Our experiments show that this action-based reasoning process\nsignificantly improves calibrated accuracy, reducing the Brier score by 18\\%\ncompared to a non-interactive baseline. To validate the faithfulness of the\nagent's explanations, we introduce a causal intervention method. By masking the\nvisual evidence the agent chooses to use, we observe a measurable degradation\nin its performance ($\\Delta$Brier=+0.029), confirming that the evidence is\nintegral to its decision-making process.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nDouble Information Bottleneck (DIB) strategy to obtain a powerful, unified\ncompact multimodal representation. Implemented within the framework of low-rank\nRenyi's entropy functional, DIB offers enhanced robustness against diverse\nnoise sources and computational tractability for high-dimensional data, as\ncompared to the conventional Shannon entropy-based methods.

Consequently, DIB yields a multimodal representation that\neffectively filters out noisy information from unimodal data while capturing\ninter-modal complementarity.

We present DeepSpecs,\na RAG system enhanced by structural and temporal reasoning via three\nmetadata-rich databases: SpecDB (clause-aligned specification text), ChangeDB\n(line-level version diffs), and TDocDB (standardization meeting documents).\nDeepSpecs explicitly resolves cross-references by recursively retrieving\nreferenced clauses through metadata lookup, and traces specification evolution\nby mining changes and linking them to Change Requests that document design\nrationale. We curate two 5G QA datasets: 573 expert-annotated real-world\nquestions from practitioner forums and educational resources, and 350\nevolution-focused questions derived from approved Change Requests. Across\nmultiple LLM backends, DeepSpecs outperforms base models and state-of-the-art\ntelecom RAG systems; ablations confirm that explicit cross-reference resolution\nand evolution-aware retrieval substantially improve answer quality,\nunderscoring the value of modeling the structural and temporal properties of 5G\nstandards."}

The FFBA combine\nideas from the popular LoRA and parallel adapters to improve the overall\nfine-tuning accuracies. At the same time, latencies are minimized by fusing the\nforward and backward adapters into existing projection layers of the base\nmodel. Experimental results show that the proposed FFB adapters perform\nsignificantly better than the popularly used LoRA in both accuracy and latency\nfor a similar parameter budget."}

Our findings suggest that roughly half\nof the neurons in layer 5 can be accurately described by compact, rule-based\ndecision trees ($R^2 > 0.7$ for 913 of 2,048 neurons), while the remainder\nlikely participate in more distributed or non-rule-based computations. We\nverify the causal relevance of patterns identified by our decision trees\nthrough targeted interventions. For a specific square, for specific game\npatterns, we ablate neurons corresponding to those patterns and find an\napproximately 5-10 fold stronger degradation in the model's ability to predict\nlegal moves along those patterns compared to control patterns. To facilitate\nfuture work, we provide a Python tool that maps rule-based game behaviors to\ntheir implementing neurons, serving as a resource for researchers to test\nwhether their interpretability methods recover meaningful computational\nstructures."}

We introduce the assumption that heterogeneous client data\nlead to distinct local optima, and show that this assumption implies two key\nconsequences: 1) the distance among clients' local optima raises the lower\nbound of the global objective, making perfect fitting of all client data\nimpossible; and 2) in the final training stage, the global model oscillates\nwithin a region instead of converging to a single optimum, limiting its ability\nto fully fit the data.

While modern AI-based generative models are orders of\nmagnitude faster to evaluate, computing sensitivities with them remains a\nsignificant bottleneck. This work addresses this challenge by applying the\nadjoint state method for calculating gradients in generative flow models, with\ndiffusion models as a special case. We apply this method to the cBottle\ngenerative model, an emulator of ERA5 data, to perform sensitivity analysis\nwith respect to sea surface temperatures. Furthermore, we propose a novel\ngradient self-consistency check to quantitatively validate the computed\nsensitivities against the model's own outputs. Our results provide initial\nevidence that this approach can produce reliable gradients, reducing the\ncomputational cost of sensitivity analysis from weeks on a supercomputer with a\nphysical model to hours on a GPU, thereby simplifying a critical workflow in\nclimate science."}

Specifically, we show that starting from an unbiased\nisotropic normal distribution, samples undergo sharp, discrete transitions,\neventually forming distinct events of a desired distribution while\nprogressively revealing finer structure. As this process is reversible, these\ntransitions also occur in reverse, where intermediate states progressively\nmerge, tracing a path back to the initial distribution. We demonstrate that\nthese transitions can be detected as discontinuities in $n^{\\text{th}}$-order\ncross-fluctuations. For variance-preserving SDEs, we derive a closed-form for\nthese cross-fluctuations that is efficiently computable for the reverse\ntrajectory. We find that detecting these transitions directly boosts sampling\nefficiency, accelerates class-conditional and rare-class generation, and\nimproves two zero-shot tasks--image classification and style transfer--without\nexpensive grid search or retraining.

Our approach separates the trend\nand seasonal learning into distinct blocks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)\nstructure captures the trend, while adaptive wavelet distillation facilitates\neffective multi-resolution learning of seasonal components. This decomposition\nimproves the interpretability of the model on multiple scales. In addition, we\ndesigned a comprehensive correction mechanism aimed at ensuring that the\ngenerated components exhibit a high degree of internal consistency and preserve\nmeaningful interrelationships with one another. Our empirical studies on eight\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that STDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in time series generation tasks. Furthermore, we extend the model's\napplication to multi-window long-sequence time series generation, which\ndelivered reliable results and highlighted its robustness and versatility."}

In this work we assess the degree to which\nSparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can reveal (and control) associations the model has\nmade between race and stigmatizing concepts. We first identify SAE latents in\nGemma-2 models which appear to correlate with Black individuals. We find that\nthis latent activates on reasonable input sequences (e.g., \"African American\")\nbut also problematic words like \"incarceration\". We then show that we can use\nthis latent to steer models to generate outputs about Black patients, and\nfurther that this can induce problematic associations in model outputs as a\nresult. For example, activating the Black latent increases the risk assigned to\nthe probability that a patient will become \"belligerent\". We evaluate the\ndegree to which such steering via latents might be useful for mitigating bias.\nWe find that this offers improvements in simple settings, but is less\nsuccessful for more realistic and complex clinical tasks.

This model helps us explain prior\nempirical phenomena - e.g., sigmoidal learning curves as in-context evidence\naccumulates - while predicting novel ones - e.g., additivity of both\ninterventions in log-belief space, which results in distinct phases such that\nsudden and dramatic behavioral shifts can be induced by slightly changing\nintervention controls. Taken together, this work offers a unified account of\nprompt-based and activation-based control of LLM behavior, and a methodology\nfor empirically predicting the effects of these interventions."}

However, these models natively do not perform well on common vision\ntasks, such as CIFAR-10/100. In this work, we propose LL-ViT, a novel edge\noptimized vision transformer design that integrates layers of LUT neurons\nwithin the transformer architecture. Based on our characterization that reveals\nthat a majority of model weights and computations are from the channel mixer\n(MLP layer), we design an alternate LUT-based channel mixer, and simultaneously\ndevelop an FPGA-based accelerator for LL-ViT. Contrary to some attempts to\nreplace each multiplication with a table lookup, our architecture utilizes a\nneural learning approach which natively learns the LUT functions. This approach\nallows for reduced model sizes, and a computational and energy-efficient\ninference solution for vision transformer models. Evaluating on edge-suitable\nworkloads, we achieve accuracies of 95.5% on CIFAR-10, 78.8% on CIFAR-100, and\n60.9% on Tiny-ImageNet datasets, comparable to the baseline transformer.

Hydra uses a 2-dimensional\nrecurrence across both time and variate at each step, which is more powerful\nthan mixing methods. Although the 2-dimensional nature of the model makes its\ntraining recurrent and non-parallelizable, we present a new 2D-chunk-wise\ntraining algorithm that approximates the actual recurrence with $\\times 10$\nefficiency improvement, while maintaining the effectiveness. Our experimental\nresults on a diverse set of tasks and datasets, including time series\nforecasting, classification, and anomaly detection show the superior\nperformance of Hydra compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

The process involves the placement of interdependent\ncomputing tasks, structured as Service Function Chains, over distributed cloud\ninfrastructures. This is achieved while satisfying strict resource, bandwidth\nand latency constraints. It is acknowledged that classical approaches,\nincluding mixed-integer nonlinear programming, heuristics and reinforcement\nlearning are limited in terms of scalability, constraint handling and\ngeneralisation capacity. In the present study, a novel theoretical framework is\nproposed, which is based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for\nCNF placement. The present approach proposes a reconceptualisation of placement\nas a generative graph to assignment task, where the placement problem is\nencoded as a heterogeneous graph, and a Graph Neural Network denoiser is\ntrained to iteratively refine noisy CNF-to-cloud assignment matrices. The model\nincorporates constraint-specific losses directly into the loss function,\nthereby allowing it to learn feasible solution spaces. The integration of the\nDDPM formulation with structured combinatorial constraints is achieved through\na rigorous and systematic approach. Extensive evaluations across diverse\ntopologies have been conducted, which have confirmed that the model\nconsistently produces feasible solutions with orders of magnitude faster\ninference than MINLP solvers.

Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,\nIA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model\nfamilies (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235\nfine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and\nnine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based\napproaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least\ndisruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In\ncontrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce\nsafety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and\nincreased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:\nLLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest\nsafety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation\nlayer, displays the greatest variance. Improvements in safety do not\nnecessarily translate into improvements in fairness, and no single\nconfiguration optimizes all fairness metrics simultaneously, indicating an\ninherent trade-off between these objectives.

Our approach\ninvolves a set of LLM traveler agents, equipped with a memory system and a\nlearnable persona, which serve as simulators for human travelers. To ensure\nbehavioral alignment, we introduce an LLM calibration agent that leverages the\nreasoning and analytical capabilities of LLMs to train the personas of these\ntraveler agents. Working together, this dual-agent system is designed to track\nand align the underlying decision-making mechanisms of travelers and produce\nrealistic, adaptive simulations. Using a real-world dataset from a day-to-day\nroute choice experiment, we show our approach significantly outperforms\nexisting LLM-based methods in both individual behavioral alignment and\naggregate simulation accuracy.

We present KVTC, a lightweight transform coder that\ncompresses KV caches for compact on-GPU and off-GPU storage. Drawing on\nclassical media compression, KVTC combines PCA-based feature decorrelation,\nadaptive quantization, and entropy coding. It requires only a brief initial\ncalibration and leaves model parameters unchanged. By exploiting redundancies\nin KV caches, KVTC achieves up to 20$\\times$ compression while maintaining\nreasoning and long-context accuracy, and 40$\\times$ or higher for specific use\ncases. We test KVTC with Llama 3, Mistral NeMo, and R1-Qwen 2.5 models across\nbenchmarks including AIME25, LiveCodeBench, GSM8K, MMLU, Qasper, RULER, and\nMATH-500. It consistently outperforms inference-time baselines such as token\neviction, quantization, and SVD-based methods, while achieving higher\ncompression ratios. These results support KVTC as a practical building block\nfor memory-efficient LLM serving with reusable KV caches."}

Building bespoke environments for training is\nheavy, brittle, and limits progress. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs\ncan simulate realistic environment feedback without access to actual testbed\ndata or APIs. Inspired by this capability, we propose two frameworks:\nSimia-SFT, a pipeline that synthesizes SFT data by amplifying small seed sets\ninto diverse trajectories in an environment-agnostic manner, and Simia-RL, a\nframework that enables RL training without real environment implementations\nthrough LLM-simulated feedback. Fine-tuning open models yields consistent\nimprovements across multiple benchmarks, surpassing GPT-4o and approaching\no4-mini on $\\tau^2$-Bench. Together, Simia-SFT and Simia-RL enable scalable\nagent training without environment engineering, replacing heavy and brittle\nimplementations with flexible LLM-based simulation."}
