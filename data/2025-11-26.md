### [1] [Efficient Multi-Hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs via LLM Planning and Embedding-Guided Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19648)
*Manil Shrestha,Edward Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种混合算法来解决多跳知识图谱问答中的效率和可验证性问题：LLM引导规划使用单次LLM调用预测关系序列，嵌入引导神经搜索完全消除LLM调用，通过轻量级边缘评分器融合文本和图嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多跳知识图谱问答中的组合爆炸问题，减少昂贵的LLM推理成本，确保答案在结构化知识中的可验证性。

Method: 1. LLM引导规划：单次LLM调用预测关系序列，通过广度优先搜索执行；2. 嵌入引导神经搜索：使用6.7M参数的轻量级边缘评分器融合文本和图嵌入，完全消除LLM调用。

Result: LLM引导规划达到接近完美的准确率（micro-F1 > 0.90），嵌入引导神经搜索实现100倍以上的加速且保持竞争性准确率。通过知识蒸馏将规划能力压缩到4B参数模型中。

Conclusion: 可验证的多跳推理不需要在推理时使用大规模模型，而是需要结合符号结构和学习表示的适当架构归纳偏差。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering over knowledge graphs remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible reasoning paths. Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation. Our results show that verifiable multi-hop reasoning does not require massive models at inference time, but rather the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations.

### [2] [Can LLMs Faithfully Explain Themselves in Low-Resource Languages? A Case Study on Emotion Detection in Persian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19719)
*Mobina Mehrazar,Mohammad Amin Yousefi,Parisa Abolfath Beygi,Behnam Bahrak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估波斯语情感分类中LLM生成解释的忠实性，发现模型解释与人类标注存在显著差异，提示策略影响解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在低资源语言中生成自解释的忠实性问题亟待验证，特别是在波斯语情感分类任务中。

Method: 通过比较LLM识别的影响词与人类标注，使用token级对数概率置信度评估忠实性，测试两种提示策略。

Result: LLM分类性能强但解释忠实性差，模型解释间一致性高于与人类标注的一致性。

Conclusion: 当前解释方法和指标存在局限，需开发更稳健方法确保LLM在多语言和低资源环境中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate self-explanations alongside their predictions, a practice that raises concerns about the faithfulness of these explanations, especially in low-resource languages. This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in the context of emotion classification in Persian, a low-resource language, by comparing the influential words identified by the model against those identified by human annotators. We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments. These results highlight the limitations of current explanation methods and metrics, emphasizing the need for more robust approaches to ensure LLM reliability in multilingual and low-resource contexts.

### [3] [Comparative Analysis of LoRA-Adapted Embedding Models for Clinical Cardiology Text Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19739)
*Richard J. Young,Alice M. Matthews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Domain-specific text embeddings are critical for clinical natural language processing, yet systematic comparisons across model architectures remain limited. This study evaluates ten transformer-based embedding models adapted for cardiology through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on 106,535 cardiology text pairs derived from authoritative medical textbooks. Results demonstrate that encoder-only architectures, particularly BioLinkBERT, achieve superior domain-specific performance (separation score: 0.510) compared to larger decoder-based models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. The findings challenge the assumption that larger language models necessarily produce better domain-specific embeddings and provide practical guidance for clinical NLP system development. All models, training code, and evaluation datasets are publicly available to support reproducible research in medical informatics.

*Colton Casto,Anna Ivanova,Evelina Fedorenko,Nancy Kanwisher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出语言理解需要将信息从语言系统导出到其他脑区，以构建丰富的心理模型，并回顾了支持这一假说的证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言理解的深层机制，超越表层意义提取，关注大脑如何通过多脑区协作构建情境心理模型。

Method: 回顾现有证据，利用认知神经科学的最新进展，提出直接测试该假说的新策略。

Result: 论证了语言系统处理能力有限，需要其他脑区参与才能实现深度理解，为揭示语言理解的认知和神经基础提供了新方向。

Conclusion: 语言深度理解依赖于语言系统与其他脑区的信息交互，认知神经科学的进展为直接验证这一机制提供了可能。

Abstract: Language understanding entails not just extracting the surface-level meaning of the linguistic input, but constructing rich mental models of the situation it describes. Here we propose that because processing within the brain's core language system is fundamentally limited, deeply understanding language requires exporting information from the language system to other brain regions that compute perceptual and motor representations, construct mental models, and store our world knowledge and autobiographical memories. We review the existing evidence for this hypothesis, and argue that recent progress in cognitive neuroscience provides both the conceptual foundation and the methods to directly test it, thus opening up a new strategy to reveal what it means, cognitively and neurally, to understand language.

### [5] [Gender Bias in Emotion Recognition by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19785)
*Maureen Herbert,Katie Sun,Angelica Lim,Yasaman Etesam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型在情感心智理论中的性别偏见问题，并评估了多种去偏策略，发现基于训练的方法比推理时提示工程更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在日常生活中的广泛应用，评估和确保其公平性变得至关重要。本文特别关注在情感心智理论领域中LLMs是否存在性别偏见。

Method: 通过向LLMs描述人物及其环境，询问"这个人感觉如何？"来评估性别偏见，并提出并评估了多种去偏策略，包括基于训练和推理时提示的方法。

Result: 研究发现，要显著减少偏见，需要基于训练的方法进行干预，而不仅仅依赖推理时的提示工程方法。

Conclusion: 在情感心智理论领域，大语言模型确实存在性别偏见，有效的去偏需要训练层面的干预措施。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and their growing integration into daily life underscore the importance of evaluating and ensuring their fairness. In this work, we examine fairness within the domain of emotional theory of mind, investigating whether LLMs exhibit gender biases when presented with a description of a person and their environment and asked, "How does this person feel?". Furthermore, we propose and evaluate several debiasing strategies, demonstrating that achieving meaningful reductions in bias requires training based interventions rather than relying solely on inference-time prompt-based approaches such as prompt engineering.

*Saif M. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NRC VAD Lexicon v2扩展了情感词汇资源，新增了1万个英语多词表达和2.5万个单词的效价、唤醒度和支配度人工评分，提高了覆盖范围并验证了可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有词汇资源如2018年发布的NRC VAD Lexicon仅包含单词的情感维度评分，缺乏对多词表达的情感分析支持，且需要更新近年常用的词汇。

Method: 通过人工标注方式收集了10k个多词表达及其组成词的效价、唤醒度和支配度评分，并扩展了2018年后常用单词的覆盖。

Result: 新版本词汇表包含10k个多词表达和25k个单词，数据可靠性高，可用于分析多词表达的情感特性和情感组合性。

Conclusion: NRC VAD Lexicon v2为NLP、心理学、公共卫生等领域的多词表达情感分析研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Factor analysis studies have shown that the primary dimensions of word meaning are Valence (V), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D). Existing lexicons such as the NRC VAD Lexicon, published in 2018, include VAD association ratings for words. Here, we present a complement to it, which has human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and their constituent words. We also increase the coverage of unigrams, especially words that have become more common since 2018. In all, the new NRC VAD Lexicon v2 now has entries for 10k MWEs and 25k words, in addition to the entries in v1. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to examine emotional characteristics of MWEs, including: 1. The degree to which MWEs (idioms, noun compounds, and verb particle constructions) exhibit strong emotionality; 2. The degree of emotional compositionality in MWEs. The lexicon enables a wide variety of research in NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences.

*Koena Ronny Mabokela,Tim Schlippe,Mpho Raborife,Turgay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用表情符号和情感词汇的自动语言无关情感标注方法，在英语、Sepedi和Setswana推文上分别达到66%、69%和63%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲语言作为低资源语言缺乏标注数据，手动标注耗时昂贵，需要自动高效的标注方法

Method: 利用表情符号和情感词汇信息进行语言无关的情感标注

Result: 英语推文标注准确率66%，Sepedi推文69%，Setswana推文63%，平均只需修正34%的自动生成标签

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少手动标注工作量，为低资源语言情感分析提供实用解决方案

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a helpful task to automatically analyse opinions and emotions on various topics in areas such as AI for Social Good, AI in Education or marketing. While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.

*Shi-Wei Dai,Yan-Wei Shie,Tsung-Huan Yang,Lun-Wei Ku,Yung-Hui Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaPulse框架通过动态优化角色扮演提示，利用LLMs对人格特质的固有知识，结合情境响应基准作为评分工具，显著提升了LLMs中人格表达的真实性和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然探索了使用提示来激发LLMs的特定人格特质，但未能优化这些提示以最大化人格表达效果。

Method: 提出PersonaPulse框架，利用LLMs对人格特质的固有知识迭代增强角色扮演提示，并整合情境响应基准作为评分工具，确保更真实和情境化的评估来指导优化过程。

Result: 定量评估显示PersonaPulse生成的提示优于先前基于心理学研究设计的方法；探索了模型大小与人格建模的关系；发现某些人格特质的激发程度可以通过暂停优化过程来部分控制。

Conclusion: 提示优化在塑造LLMs中人格表达方面至关重要，为未来自适应AI交互研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be an effective way to create more engaging and enjoyable user-AI interactions. While previous studies have explored using prompts to elicit specific personality traits in LLMs, they have not optimized these prompts to maximize personality expression. To address this limitation, we propose PersonaPulse: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs, a framework that leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while integrating a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool, ensuring a more realistic and contextually grounded evaluation to guide the optimization process. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies. Additionally, we explore the relationship between model size and personality modeling through extensive experiments. Finally, we find that, for certain personality traits, the extent of personality evocation can be partially controlled by pausing the optimization process. These findings underscore the importance of prompt optimization in shaping personality expression within LLMs, offering valuable insights for future research on adaptive AI interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型在医疗错误处理中的不同提示策略效果，发现检索增强动态提示在错误检测和修正方面优于零样本提示和静态提示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文档中存在可能危及患者安全的事实、诊断和管理错误，需要探索大语言模型在不同提示策略下检测和修正这些错误的能力

Method: 使用MEDEC数据集评估9个指令调优的大语言模型，比较零样本提示、静态随机示例提示和检索增强动态提示在错误标记检测、错误句子检测和错误修正三个子任务中的表现

Result: 检索增强动态提示在所有9个LLM中降低了约15%的假阳性率，在错误句子检测中提高了5-10%的召回率，并生成更符合上下文的修正

Conclusion: 检索增强动态提示在多样化的LLM中表现最优，使用检索示例提高了检测准确性，减少了假阳性，增强了医疗错误修正的可靠性

Abstract: Objective: Clinical documentation contains factual, diagnostic, and management errors that can compromise patient safety. Large language models (LLMs) may help detect and correct such errors, but their behavior under different prompting strategies remains unclear. We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.
  Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.
  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.
  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting. Using retrieved exemplars improves detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and enhances the reliability of medical error correction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AppSelectBench基准，用于评估计算机使用代理（CUAs）在应用选择方面的能力，包含10万个真实用户任务和100个桌面应用，发现现有模型在跨应用推理方面仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估细粒度API选择，缺乏对模型在不同应用间进行推理和选择能力的评估，而应用选择是CUAs有效运行的基本能力。

Method: 开发了用户任务生成流水线，创建真实、多样且语义基础的用户意图，并建立了统一的评估协议，包括随机、启发式、零样本、少样本和检索增强设置。

Result: 实验显示即使是能力最强的模型在跨应用推理方面仍存在系统性优势和弱点，难以做出一致的应用选择。

Conclusion: AppSelectBench为研究和推进应用级推理能力提供了基础，这是智能CUAs重要但尚未充分探索的能力。

Abstract: Computer Using Agents (CUAs) are increasingly equipped with external tools, enabling them to perform complex and realistic tasks. For CUAs to operate effectively, application selection, which refers to deciding which application to use before invoking fine-grained tools such as APIs, is a fundamental capability. It determines whether the agent initializes the correct environment, avoids orchestration confusion, and efficiently focuses on relevant context. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess fine-grained API selection, offering limited insight into whether models can reason across and choose between different applications. To fill this gap, we introduce AppSelectBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating application selection in CUAs. AppSelectBench contains a novel user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, together with unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented-settings. AppSelectBench covers one hundred widely used desktop applications and includes more than one hundred thousand realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user tasks. Extensive experiments across both closed-source and open-source large language models reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing that even the most capable models still struggle to make consistent application choices. Together, these results establish AppSelectBench as a foundation for studying and advancing application level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs.

TL;DR: R2R是一个领域感知的检索重排序框架，通过动态专家路由和两阶段训练策略解决领域专业化问题，在金融、法律等高风险领域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用重排序模型在金融、法律等高风险领域缺乏领域特定知识，而简单微调会导致表面形式过拟合和灾难性遗忘。

Method: 采用动态专家路由和两阶段训练策略（EAG），通过掩码最具预测性的表面线索，强制模型学习领域不变的相关性模式；使用轻量级潜在语义路由器选择最优LoRA专家。

Result: 在多个领域（法律、医疗、金融）和不同重排序骨干模型上的实验表明，R2R始终优于通用模型和单领域微调基线。

Conclusion: R2R是一个模型无关的模块化方法，具有强大的跨领域鲁棒性，能够有效实现领域专业化。

Abstract: Decoder-only rerankers are central to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines. Our results confirm that R2R is a model-agnostic and modular approach to domain specialization with strong cross-domain robustness.

### [12] [Directional Optimization Asymmetry in Transformers: A Synthetic Stress Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19997)
*Mihir Sahasrabudhe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformers理论上具有反转不变性，但在实际应用中存在方向性学习差异。通过合成基准测试发现，即使在没有语言先验的情况下，因果Transformer训练仍存在固有的方向性摩擦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在方向性学习中的矛盾：理论上反转不变，但实证研究显示存在"反转诅咒"。需要区分这种方向性失败是源于语言统计特性还是架构本身。

Method: 使用完全合成的、熵控制的基准测试，构建随机字符串映射任务。通过可调分支因子K创建前向任务（零条件熵）和逆任务（有熵下限），比较GPT-2模型在不同方向上的表现。

Result: 即使从头训练的GPT-2模型也表现出强烈的方向性优化差距（如K=5时1.16 nats），远大于在相同数据上训练的MLP。预训练初始化改变优化行为但不消除差距，LoRA在高熵逆映射上遇到容量限制。

Conclusion: 研究分离出了一个最小化的、无语义的方向性摩擦特征，这是因果Transformer训练固有的特性，即使在移除了语言先验、词频和语料级时间不对称性后仍然存在。

Abstract: Transformers are theoretically reversal-invariant: their function class does not prefer left-to-right over right-to-left mappings. Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a "reversal curse," and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的多类别分类框架，用于从社交媒体数据中检测10种心理健康和网络欺凌类别。通过端到端微调的MentalBERT模型表现最佳，并开发了结合SHAP和LLM的可解释性框架及原型仪表板。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字空间中日益严重的心理健康问题和网络欺凌需要可扩展且可解释的检测系统。

Method: 使用Twitter和Reddit数据集，采用"分割再平衡"流程，比较了传统词汇模型、混合方法和多种端到端微调transformer模型。

Result: MentalBERT模型表现最佳，准确率达0.92，宏F1分数为0.76，超越了通用模型和零样本LLM基线。

Conclusion: 该系统被定位为人工参与的筛查辅助工具而非诊断工具，强调了未来需要多标签、临床验证数据集的重要性。

Abstract: Mental health challenges and cyberbullying are increasingly prevalent in digital spaces, necessitating scalable and interpretable detection systems. This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous "split-then-balance" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard ("Social Media Screener") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化视觉语言模型需要为每个新概念学习单独嵌入，无法支持测试时的实时适应，在大规模场景下无法高效检索概念嵌入。

Method: 利用双曲表示开发在线概念学习框架，采用免训练的概念嵌入生成范式，在测试时动态生成概念嵌入。

Conclusion: Online-PVLM框架使个性化视觉语言模型既具有可扩展性又高效，解决了现有方法的实时适应限制。

Abstract: Personalized Visual Language Models (VLMs) are gaining increasing attention for their formidable ability in user-specific concepts aligned interactions (e.g., identifying a user's bike). Existing methods typically require the learning of separate embeddings for each new concept, which fails to support real-time adaptation during testing. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in large-scale scenarios, where efficient retrieval of concept embeddings is not achievable. To alleviate this gap, we propose Online-PVLM, a framework for online concept learning by leveraging hyperbolic representations. Our approach makes a train-free paradigm for concept embeddings generation at test time, making the use of personalized VLMs both scalable and efficient. In addition, we develop OP-Eval, a comprehensive and large-scale benchmark comprising 1,292 concepts and over 30K high-quality instances with diverse question types, designed to rigorously assess online concept learning in realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed framework. Our source code and dataset will be made available.

TL;DR: 提出了MTA框架，通过合并-适应方法解决个性化大语言模型的存储扩展性和稀疏数据性能问题，包含元LoRA银行构建、自适应LoRA融合和少样本个性化LoRA堆叠三个阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化大语言模型方法为每个用户单独微调模块存在存储成本线性增长和稀疏数据性能不佳两大限制。

Method: MTA框架：1）构建共享元LoRA银行；2）自适应LoRA融合动态合成用户特定模块；3）少样本个性化LoRA堆叠添加超低秩轻量模块。

Result: 在LaMP基准测试中，该方法在多个任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MTA框架有效解决了PLLMs的扩展性和稀疏数据性能问题，实现了高效且灵活的个性化。

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) aim to align model outputs with individual user preferences, a crucial capability for user-centric applications. However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings. Extensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SOTA methods across multiple tasks.

*Duc Anh Vu,Thong Nguyen,Cong-Duy Nguyen,Viet Anh Nguyen,Anh Tuan Luu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiasPrompting是一个新颖的推理框架，通过引导LLMs为所有可能答案选项生成并批判性评估推理，从而提高多项选择题任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多项选择题任务中将答案选项呈现给LLMs时缺乏上下文背景或解释，导致无法充分探索所有可能答案，从而降低了模型的推理能力。

Method: BiasPrompting包含两个组件：1) 推理生成阶段，模型被提示为每个答案选项生成支持性推理；2) 推理引导一致性阶段，将生成的推理综合起来选择最合理的答案。

Result: 在五个广泛使用的多项选择题基准测试中，BiasPrompting表现出显著改进，特别是在现有方法表现不佳的复杂和具有挑战性的问题设置中。

Conclusion: BiasPrompting增强了LLMs的推理能力，并为处理复杂和具有挑战性的问题提供了坚实的基础，特别是在现有方法表现不足的场景中。

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), their performance on multiple-choice question (MCQ) tasks has improved significantly. However, existing approaches face key limitations: answer choices are typically presented to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation. This absence of context can lead to incomplete exploration of all possible answers, ultimately degrading the models' reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction. It consists of two components: first, a reasoning generation stage, where the model is prompted to produce supportive reasonings for each answer option, and then, a reasoning-guided agreement stage, where the generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer. Through comprehensive evaluations, BiasPrompting demonstrates significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks. Our experiments showcase that BiasPrompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and provides a strong foundation for tackling complex and challenging questions, particularly in settings where existing methods underperform.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSA是一个统一的稀疏注意力训练框架，通过双向对齐机制解决现有稀疏注意力方法中的梯度更新不足问题，在保持高性能的同时实现更强的稀疏性，并支持灵活的计算-性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有稀疏注意力方法中的关键悖论：虽然旨在近似全注意力，但产生的注意力稀疏度反而低于全注意力模型，这限制了其有效性。主要原因是梯度更新不足，被排除在稀疏训练之外的低秩键值对无法学习适当的抑制。

Method: 提出SSA（稀疏稀疏注意力）统一训练框架，同时考虑稀疏和全注意力，在每一层强制执行双向对齐。这种设计保持所有token的梯度流，同时明确鼓励稀疏注意力输出与其全注意力对应物对齐，从而促进更强的稀疏性。

Result: SSA在多个常识基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，支持稀疏和全注意力推理。模型能够平滑适应不同的稀疏预算，性能随着允许参与的token数量增加而一致提升。此外，SSA展现出最强的长上下文外推能力。

Conclusion: SSA通过解决梯度更新不足问题，实现了高效的稀疏注意力训练，在保持高性能的同时支持灵活的计算-性能权衡，并显著提升了长上下文外推能力。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention limits efficient long-context processing in large language models (LLMs). Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.

Motivation: 解决现有语料库主要局限于单语言和单标签情感识别的问题，这些语料库限制了语言多样性、无法建模混合情感且缺乏生态效度。

Method: 构建包含英语、普通话和粤语的多语言语料库，整合来自在线平台的自发情感表达，使用32个细粒度情感类别进行标注，采用自监督学习模型建立实验基线。

Result: 实验基线显示在说话人无关的性别、年龄和个性评估中表现稳健，HuBERT-large-EN模型取得最佳结果。

Conclusion: EM2LDL通过整合语言多样性和生态效度，能够探索多语言环境中的复杂情感动态，为开发适应性强的共情系统提供了多功能测试平台。

Abstract: This study introduces EM2LDL, a novel multilingual speech corpus designed to advance mixed emotion recognition through label distribution learning. Addressing the limitations of predominantly monolingual and single-label emotion corpora \textcolor{black}{that restrict linguistic diversity, are unable to model mixed emotions, and lack ecological validity}, EM2LDL comprises expressive utterances in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese, capturing the intra-utterance code-switching prevalent in multilingual regions like Hong Kong and Macao. The corpus integrates spontaneous emotional expressions from online platforms, annotated with fine-grained emotion distributions across 32 categories. Experimental baselines using self-supervised learning models demonstrate robust performance in speaker-independent gender-, age-, and personality-based evaluations, with HuBERT-large-EN achieving optimal results. By incorporating linguistic diversity and ecological validity, EM2LDL enables the exploration of complex emotional dynamics in multilingual settings. This work provides a versatile testbed for developing adaptive, empathetic systems for applications in affective computing, including mental health monitoring and cross-cultural communication. The dataset, annotations, and baseline codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xingfengli/EM2LDL.

TL;DR: 该论文探索使用GPT-4.1、Gemini-2.5和LLaMA-4等大型语言模型，通过提示工程和少样本学习来解决印度语言语法错误校正的资源不足问题，在多个印度语言上取得了领先结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于Transformer的模型和大型标注数据集显著提升了英语等高资源语言的语法错误校正性能，但对于大多数印度语言，由于资源有限、语言多样性和复杂形态学，GEC仍然是一个挑战性任务。

Method: 采用基于提示的方法，结合最先进的大型语言模型（如GPT-4.1、Gemini-2.5和LLaMA-4）和少样本策略，使其适应低资源环境。使用零样本和少样本等基本提示策略。

Result: 在共享任务中取得领先结果：泰米尔语排名第1（GLEU: 91.57）、印地语排名第1（GLEU: 85.69）、泰卢固语排名第2（GLEU: 85.22）、孟加拉语排名第4（GLEU: 92.86）、马拉雅拉姆语排名第5（GLEU: 92.97）。

Abstract: Grammatical error correction (GEC) is an important task in Natural Language Processing that aims to automatically detect and correct grammatical mistakes in text. While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC. Our experiments show that carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation significantly enhance correction quality across multiple Indic languages. We achieved leading results in the shared task--ranking 1st in Tamil (GLEU: 91.57) and Hindi (GLEU: 85.69), 2nd in Telugu (GLEU: 85.22), 4th in Bangla (GLEU: 92.86), and 5th in Malayalam (GLEU: 92.97). These findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt-driven NLP techniques and underscore the potential of large-scale LLMs to bridge resource gaps in multilingual GEC.

Motivation: 传统NER方法在处理跨句子的不连续实体时存在分割错误和遗漏问题，严重影响识别准确性。

Method: 在基于网格标注的方法基础上，引入了图像数据增强技术（裁剪、缩放、填充）来增强模型识别不连续实体和处理分割挑战的能力。

Result: 在CADEC、ShARe13和ShARe14数据集上，整体F1分数提升1-2.5%，不连续实体的F1分数提升3.7-8.4%。

Conclusion: 集成图像数据增强技术的网格模型能有效解决不连续实体的分割问题，显著提升NER性能。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task in natural language processing, yet it remains particularly challenging for discontinuous entities. The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements. Evaluations on the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets show F1 score gains of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% for discontinuous entities, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: REFLEX是一种基于大语言模型的自动事实核查范式，通过角色扮演对话和对比激活对提取，在不依赖外部知识源的情况下提高判决准确性和解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的事实核查方法过度依赖外部知识源，导致延迟和幻觉问题，影响可靠性、可解释性和实时性。

Method: 将事实核查重构为角色扮演对话，联合训练判决预测和解释生成，自适应提取对比激活对构建引导向量，将真相分解为风格和实质。

Result: 在真实数据集上，REFLEX优于先前方法，仅用465个自精炼训练样本就达到最先进性能，解释信号可提升其他模型7.57%的性能。

Conclusion: 内部解释信号在事实推理中具有双重作用，既能解释又能增强推理能力，REFLEX为高效可靠的事实核查提供了新范式。

Abstract: The prevalence of misinformation on social media threatens public trust, demanding automated fact-checking systems that provide accurate verdicts with interpretable explanations. However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法假设有大量可用计算能力，但在批处理等主流推理系统中，这些方法因压缩了空闲计算能力而效果有限。需要在低验证资源和低调度成本下进行推测解码。

Method: 提出SpecFormer架构，集成单向和双向注意力机制，结合自回归模型从整个输入序列提取信息的能力和非自回归模型的并行生成优势。

Result: 在各种规模模型的损失推测解码实验中，SpecFormer为扩展LLM推理设定了新标准，具有更低的训练需求和计算成本。

Conclusion: SpecFormer通过创新的架构设计，在大型批处理场景下也能实现一致的加速效果，为LLM推理提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by utilizing otherwise idle computational resources during memory-to-chip data transfer. Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios. Through lossless speculative decoding experiments across models of various scales, we demonstrate that SpecFormer sets a new standard for scaling LLM inference with lower training demands and reduced computational costs.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能够编码高层次关系概念并将其应用于新情境，理解LLMs在类比推理方面的能力与人类认知的异同。

Method: 使用比例类比和故事类比任务，分析LLMs在编码和应用关系概念时的表现，通过修补隐藏表示来测试信息传递效果。

Result: LLMs能够有效编码类比实体间的关系，但在应用关系到新实体时存在困难；策略性修补隐藏表示可部分改善性能；成功的类比推理需要强结构对齐。

Conclusion: LLMs在编码和应用高层次关系概念方面表现出初步但有限的能力，与人类认知存在相似性和差距。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is at the core of human cognition, serving as an important foundation for a variety of intellectual activities. While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment. Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition.

Conclusion: BengaliFig为评估LLM在低资源文化背景下的稳健性提供了诊断工具，并朝着包容性和遗产感知的NLP评估迈出了一步。

Abstract: Large language models excel on broad multilingual benchmarks but remain to be evaluated extensively in figurative and culturally grounded reasoning, especially in low-resource contexts. We present BengaliFig, a compact yet richly annotated challenge set that targets this gap in Bengali, a widely spoken low-resourced language. The dataset contains 435 unique riddles drawn from Bengali oral and literary traditions. Each item is annotated along five orthogonal dimensions capturing reasoning type, trap type, cultural depth, answer category, and difficulty, and is automatically converted to multiple-choice format through a constraint-aware, AI-assisted pipeline. We evaluate eight frontier LLMs from major providers under zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, revealing consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning. BengaliFig thus contributes both a diagnostic probe for evaluating LLM robustness in low-resource cultural contexts and a step toward inclusive and heritage-aware NLP evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前词干提取方法的评估方法有限，无法捕捉过度词干提取可能造成的危害，因此需要开发新的评估方法。

Method: 提出包含三个方面的综合评估框架：(1)使用词干提取有效性分数(SES)评估词干提取效用，(2)使用模型性能差异(MPD)评估对下游任务的影响，(3)使用平均归一化编辑距离(ANLD)评估词干词与原始词的语义相似度。

Result: 应用该框架比较孟加拉语(BNLTK)和英语(Snowball)词干提取器，发现孟加拉语词干提取器SES最高(1.67)但ANLD较差(0.26)，表明存在有害的过度词干提取；英语词干提取器SES适中(1.31)但ANLD较好(0.14)，对下游性能有积极贡献。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个有价值的工具，可以区分潜在效率收益(高SES)和语义保持(低ANLD)，有助于选择更可靠的词干提取器。

Abstract: Text normalization is an essential preprocessing step in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and stemming is one such normalization technique that reduces words to their base or root form. However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have created new opportunities for stylometry, the study of writing styles and authorship. Two challenges, however, remain central: training generative models when no paired data exist, and evaluating stylistic text without relying only on human judgment. In this work, we present a framework for both generating and evaluating sentences in the style of 19th-century novelists. Large language models are fine-tuned with minimal, single-token prompts to produce text in the voices of authors such as Dickens, Austen, Twain, Alcott, and Melville. To assess these generative models, we employ a transformer-based detector trained on authentic sentences, using it both as a classifier and as a tool for stylistic explanation. We complement this with syntactic comparisons and explainable AI methods, including attention-based and gradient-based analyses, to identify the linguistic cues that drive stylistic imitation. Our findings show that the generated text reflects the authors' distinctive patterns and that AI-based evaluation offers a reliable alternative to human assessment. All artifacts of this work are published online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击主要关注越狱或定向误分类，而本文旨在开发一种能系统性破坏MLLM可靠性的攻击方法，防止MLLM代理在嵌入对抗图像的网站上正常运行。

Method: 使用开源MLLM小集合，通过最大化下一标记熵的基本对抗技术（PGD）生成对抗图像，在完整图像和对抗CAPTCHA两种设置下进行攻击。

Result: 在自盒设置下，单个对抗图像能破坏集合中所有模型；生成的扰动能迁移到未见过的开源模型（如Qwen3-VL）和专有模型（如GPT-5.1）。

Conclusion: 对抗混淆攻击是一种有效的系统性威胁，能够破坏MLLM的可靠性，且具有很好的迁移性，突显了MLLM安全性的脆弱性。

Abstract: We introduce the Adversarial Confusion Attack, a new class of threats against multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike jailbreaks or targeted misclassification, the goal is to induce systematic disruption that makes the model generate incoherent or confidently incorrect outputs. Applications include embedding adversarial images into websites to prevent MLLM-powered agents from operating reliably. The proposed attack maximizes next-token entropy using a small ensemble of open-source MLLMs. In the white-box setting, we show that a single adversarial image can disrupt all models in the ensemble, both in the full-image and adversarial CAPTCHA settings. Despite relying on a basic adversarial technique (PGD), the attack generates perturbations that transfer to both unseen open-source (e.g., Qwen3-VL) and proprietary (e.g., GPT-5.1) models.

TL;DR: TAB是一个基于文本的基准测试，改编自快速失语症评估，用于评估大语言模型中的失语症样缺陷，包含四个子测试，并验证了自动化评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统临床评估不适合评估大语言模型，因为它们假设了类似人类的语用压力并探测人工架构中不存在的认知过程。需要专门针对LLMs的失语症评估工具。

Method: 开发了文本失语症评估（TAB），包含四个子测试：连贯文本、单词理解、句子理解和重复。验证了使用Gemini 2.5 Flash的自动化评估协议。

Result: 自动化评估协议与专家人类评分者具有相当的可靠性（模型-共识一致性Cohen's kappa = 0.255 vs 人类-人类一致性0.286）。

Conclusion: TAB作为一个基于临床的、可扩展的框架发布，用于分析人工系统中的语言缺陷。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a candidate "model organism" for human language, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study the computational basis of linguistic disorders like aphasia. However, traditional clinical assessments are ill-suited for LLMs, as they presuppose human-like pragmatic pressures and probe cognitive processes not inherent to artificial architectures. We introduce the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to assess aphasic-like deficits in LLMs. The TAB comprises four subtests: Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition. This paper details the TAB's design, subtests, and scoring criteria. To facilitate large-scale use, we validate an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, which achieves reliability comparable to expert human raters (prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.255 for model--consensus agreement vs. 0.286 for human--human agreement). We release TAB as a clinically-grounded, scalable framework for analyzing language deficits in artificial systems.

Method: 开发了一种新颖的语音语料库数据增强技术，专门针对低资源语言设计。

Conclusion: 该方法为增强代表性不足语言社区的语音技术提供了一个实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models for audio tasks often exhibit superior performance on English and other well-resourced languages, primarily due to the abundance of available training data. This disparity leads to an unfair performance gap for low-resource languages, where data collection is both challenging and costly. In this work, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique for speech corpora designed to mitigate this gap. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of automatic speech recognition systems on low-resource languages. Furthermore, we show that our approach outperforms existing augmentation strategies, offering a practical solution for enhancing speech technology in underrepresented linguistic communities.

Motivation: 手动分析学生对话中的话语特征耗时耗力，限制了教育研究的规模和范围。现有NLP研究很少关注教育对话数据，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了标注的教育对话数据集，包含知识建构和任务完成话语特征，并使用预训练大语言模型GPT-3.5和Llama-3.1建立基线预测模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，这些最先进的模型在该任务上表现欠佳，识别教育对话中的话语特征具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为教育对话分析提供了新的数据集和基线模型，但现有模型性能不足，表明该领域需要进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Identifying discourse features in student conversations is quite important for educational researchers to recognize the curricular and pedagogical variables that cause students to engage in constructing knowledge rather than merely completing tasks. The manual analysis of student conversations to identify these discourse features is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which limits the scale and scope of studies. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate the automatic detection of these discourse features, offering educational researchers scalable and data-driven insights. However, existing studies in NLP that focus on discourse in dialogue rarely address educational data. In this work, we address this gap by introducing an annotated educational dialogue dataset of student conversations featuring knowledge construction and task production discourse. We also establish baseline models for automatically predicting these discourse properties for each turn of talk within conversations, using pre-trained large language models GPT-3.5 and Llama-3.1. Experimental results indicate that these state-of-the-art models perform suboptimally on this task, indicating the potential for future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出AlignEval基准，通过评估LLM作为评判者的能力来间接衡量其与人类偏好的一致性，无需直接评估生成内容。研究发现生成与评估能力高度相关，新基准在排名LLM时表现优于现有自动评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估LLM与人类偏好对齐的方法需要直接评估生成内容，依赖人工标注或强LLM评判者。本文探索LLM的生成与评估能力之间的关系，寻求更高效的评估方式。

Method: 首先分析各种LLM的生成-评估一致性，发现两者强相关。基于此提出AlignEval基准，通过评估LLM作为评判者的能力来间接衡量其对齐程度。

Result: AlignEval基准在捕获人类偏好排名LLM方面，匹配或超越了AlpacaEval和Arena-Hard等广泛使用的自动评估基准。

Conclusion: LLM的生成与评估能力存在强相关性，AlignEval提供了一种无需直接评估模型输出的对齐评估方法，为理解LLM能力关系提供了新视角。

Abstract: Alignment with human preferences is an important evaluation aspect of LLMs, requiring them to be helpful, honest, safe, and to precisely follow human instructions. Evaluating large language models' (LLMs) alignment typically involves directly assessing their open-ended responses, requiring human annotators or strong LLM judges. Conversely, LLMs themselves have also been extensively evaluated as judges for assessing alignment. In this work, we examine the relationship between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities in aligning with human preferences. To this end, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the generation-evaluation consistency (GE-consistency) among various LLMs, revealing a strong correlation between their generation and evaluation capabilities when evaluated by a strong LLM preference oracle. Utilizing this finding, we propose a benchmarking paradigm that measures LLM alignment with human preferences without directly evaluating their generated outputs, instead assessing LLMs in their role as evaluators. Our evaluation shows that our proposed benchmark, AlignEval, matches or surpasses widely used automatic LLM evaluation benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, in capturing human preferences when ranking LLMs. Our study offers valuable insights into the connection between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities, and introduces a benchmark that assesses alignment without directly evaluating model outputs.

TL;DR: LatentMAS是一个无需训练的端到端框架，使LLM代理能够在连续潜在空间中直接协作，相比基于文本的多代理系统具有更高表达能力和无损信息交换，显著提升推理质量同时大幅降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理依赖基于文本的中介进行推理和通信，这限制了系统级智能的协调效率。作者希望让模型在连续潜在空间中直接协作，实现更高效的信息交换。

Method: 提出LatentMAS框架：每个代理通过最后一层隐藏嵌入进行自回归潜在思维生成，共享潜在工作内存保存和传输内部表示，确保无损信息交换。

Result: 在9个基准测试中，LatentMAS始终优于单模型和基于文本的MAS基线，准确率最高提升14.6%，输出token使用减少70.8%-83.7%，端到端推理速度提升4-4.3倍。

Conclusion: 潜在协作框架在无需额外训练的情况下，显著提升系统级推理质量并带来实质性效率增益，证明了连续潜在空间协作的优越性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) extend large language models (LLMs) from independent single-model reasoning to coordinative system-level intelligence. While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference. These results demonstrate that our new latent collaboration framework enhances system-level reasoning quality while offering substantial efficiency gains without any additional training.

Motivation: 社会经济隔离在学校分区等场景中普遍存在，导致某些群体在特定区域被过度或不足代表，这与机会和结果的不平等密切相关。

Method: 将问题建模为地理分区问题，证明最优解是加性加权Voronoi图的推广，并设计简单高效的计算算法。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决人口异质性下的公平分区问题提供了理论基础和实用工具，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Socioeconomic segregation often arises in school districting and other contexts, causing some groups to be over- or under-represented within a particular district. This phenomenon is closely linked with disparities in opportunities and outcomes. We formulate a new class of geographical partitioning problems in which the population is heterogeneous, and it is necessary to ensure fair representation for each group at each facility. We prove that the optimal solution is a novel generalization of the additively weighted Voronoi diagram, and we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to compute it, thus resolving an open question dating back to Dvoretzky et al. (1951). The efficacy and potential for practical insight of the approach are demonstrated in a realistic case study involving seven demographic groups and $78$ district offices.

TL;DR: 本文通过构建高频机构学习指数和两个新的波动率框架，研究了机构学习和区域溢出如何影响东盟股市波动动态。研究发现机构学习放大短期冲击敏感性但加速危机后正常化，网络互动改善尾部行为和短期预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将机构质量视为静态背景特征，本文将其建模为对政策冲击、信息压力和危机事件做出反应的动态机制，以更好地理解东盟股市波动动态。

Method: 使用2010-2024年印尼、马来西亚、菲律宾和泰国的日度数据，通过MIDAS-EPU方法构建高频机构学习指数，提出机构响应动态模型(IRDM)和网络集成IRDM(N-IRDM)两个新波动率框架。

Result: 机构学习放大短期冲击敏感性但加速危机后正常化，危机记忆项解释持续波动聚集，网络互动改善尾部行为和短期预测。N-IRDM显著优于基准GARCH模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了机构的双重作用，并为透明度提升、宏观审慎沟通和协调区域治理提供了政策启示。

Abstract: This paper investigates how institutional learning and regional spillovers shape volatility dynamics in ASEAN equity markets. Using daily data for Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand from 2010 to 2024, we construct a high-frequency institutional learning index via a MIDAS-EPU approach. Unlike existing studies that treat institutional quality as a static background characteristic, this paper models institutions as a dynamic mechanism that reacts to policy shocks, information pressure, and crisis events. Building on this perspective, we introduce two new volatility frameworks: the Institutional Response Dynamics Model (IRDM), which embeds crisis memory, policy shocks, and information flows; and the Network-Integrated IRDM (N-IRDM), which incorporates dynamic-correlation and institutional-similarity networks to capture cross-market transmission. Empirical results show that institutional learning amplifies short-run sensitivity to shocks yet accelerates post-crisis normalization. Crisis-memory terms explain prolonged volatility clustering, while network interactions improve tail behavior and short-horizon forecasts. Robustness checks using placebo and lagged networks indicate that spillovers reflect a strong regional common factor rather than dependence on specific correlation topologies. Diebold-Mariano and ENCNEW tests confirm that the N-IRDM significantly outperforms baseline GARCH benchmarks. The findings highlight a dual role of institutions and offer policy insights on transparency enhancement, macroprudential communication, and coordinated regional governance.

Motivation: 在Heston随机波动率模型中，当期权到期日趋近于零或行权价趋于无穷大时，标准蒙特卡洛方法会遭遇显著的方差恶化问题，需要设计有效的重要性抽样方案来应对这些罕见事件情形。

Method: 利用大偏差原理，基于对数价格累积生成函数的渐近行为设计状态依赖的测度变换。在短期限情形下，提出受速率函数变分特性启发的IS漂移；在深度虚值情形下，引入方差过程的慢均值回归缩放，其中均值回归速度按小噪声参数的平方倒数缩放。

Conclusion: 本文提出的重要性抽样方案在Heston模型下针对罕见事件定价问题具有渐近最优性，能够有效解决标准蒙特卡洛方法在短期限和深度虚值情形下的方差恶化问题。

Abstract: This paper investigates asymptotically optimal importance sampling (IS) schemes for pricing European call options under the Heston stochastic volatility model. We focus on two distinct rare-event regimes where standard Monte Carlo methods suffer from significant variance deterioration: the limit as maturity approaches zero and the limit as the strike price tends to infinity. Leveraging the large deviation principle (LDP), we design a state-dependent change of measure derived from the asymptotic behavior of the log-price cumulant generating functions. In the short-maturity regime, we rigorously prove that our proposed IS drift, inspired by the variational characterization of the rate function, achieves logarithmic efficiency (asymptotic optimality) by minimizing the decay rate of the second moment of the estimator. In the deep OTM regime, we introduce a novel slow mean-reversion scaling for the variance process, where the mean-reversion speed scales as the inverse square of the small-noise parameter (defined as the reciprocal of the log-moneyness). We establish that under this specific scaling, the variance process contributes non-trivially to the large deviation rate function, requiring a specialized Riccati analysis to verify optimality. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields substantial variance reduction--characterized by factors exceeding several orders of magnitude--compared to standard estimators in both asymptotic regimes.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文证明了在凸优化设置下，存在比Douglas-Rachford分裂方法更广泛的节俭、无提升的解析分裂方法能够无条件收敛，并完整刻画了这类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Douglas-Rachford分裂方法是经典的两算子单调包含问题求解算法，但之前研究表明它是唯一在一般两算子设置下无条件收敛的节俭、无提升解析分裂方法。本文旨在探索这种唯一性在凸优化情况下是否仍然成立。

Method: 在凸优化设置下（算子为闭真凸函数的次微分），完整刻画了所有无条件收敛的节俭、无提升解析分裂方法，并证明该刻画是尖锐的——无条件收敛恰好发生在所识别的参数区域内。

Result: 发现Douglas-Rachford方法的唯一性在凸优化情况下不成立，存在严格更大的无条件收敛方法类。通过Douglas-Rachford重构，立即得到了新的收敛ADMM型和Chambolle-Pock型方法族。

Conclusion: 凸优化设置下存在比Douglas-Rachford方法更广泛的收敛解析分裂方法，这为设计新的优化算法提供了理论依据和实际可能性。

Abstract: The Douglas-Rachford splitting method is a classical and widely used algorithm for solving monotone inclusions involving the sum of two maximally monotone operators. It was recently shown to be the unique frugal, no-lifting resolvent-splitting method that is unconditionally convergent in the general two-operator setting. In this work, we show that this uniqueness does not hold in the convex optimization case: when the operators are subdifferentials of proper, closed, convex functions, a strictly larger class of frugal, no-lifting resolvent-splitting methods is unconditionally convergent. We provide a complete characterization of all such methods in the convex optimization setting and prove that this characterization is sharp: unconditional convergence holds exactly on the identified parameter regions. These results immediately yield new families of convergent ADMM-type and Chambolle-Pock-type methods obtained through their Douglas-Rachford reformulations.

Conclusion: 碳匹配是一个准确的碳核算框架，能够激励雄心勃勃且有影响力的行动，为电力系统排放分配提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Carbon matching aims to improve corporate carbon accounting by tracking emissions rather than energy consumption and production. We present a mathematical derivation of carbon matching using marginal emission rates, where the unit of matching is tons of carbon emitted. We present analysis and open source notebooks showing how marginal emissions can be calculated on simulated electric bus networks. Importantly, we prove mathematically that distinct emissions rates can be assigned to all aspects of the electric grid - including transmission, storage, generation, and consumption - completely allocating electric grid emissions. We show that carbon matching is an accurate carbon accounting framework that can inspire ambitious and impactful action. This research fills a gap by blending carbon accounting expertise and power systems modeling to consider the effectiveness of alternative methodologies for allocating electric system emissions.

Conclusion: SS-QCQP算法为具有不等式约束的非凸优化问题提供了一种可行、高效且理论保证的求解方法，特别适用于需要严格保持可行性的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper presents the Safe Sequential Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (SS-QCQP) algorithm, a first-order method for smooth inequality-constrained nonconvex optimization that guarantees feasibility at every iteration. The method is derived from a continuous-time dynamical system whose vector field is obtained by solving a convex QCQP that enforces monotonic descent of the objective and forward invariance of the feasible set. The resulting continuous-time dynamics achieve an $O(1/t)$ convergence rate to first-order stationary points under standard constraint qualification conditions. We then propose a safeguarded Euler discretization with adaptive step-size selection that preserves this convergence rate while maintaining both descent and feasibility in discrete time. To enhance scalability, we develop an active-set variant (SS-QCQP-AS) that selectively enforces constraints near the boundary, substantially reducing computational cost without compromising theoretical guarantees. Numerical experiments on a multi-agent nonlinear optimal control problem demonstrate that SS-QCQP and SS-QCQP-AS maintain feasibility, exhibit the predicted convergence behavior, and deliver solution quality comparable to second-order solvers such as SQP and IPOPT.

Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal dividend and capital-injection problem in a Cramér--Lundberg model where claim arrivals follow a Hawkes process, capturing clustering effects often observed in insurance portfolios. We establish key analytical properties of the value function and characterise the optimal capital-injection strategy through an explicit threshold. We also show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the associated HJB variational inequality. For numerical purposes, we first compute a benchmark solution via a monotone finite-difference scheme with Howard's policy iteration. We then develop a reinforcement learning approach based on policy-gradient and actor-critic methods. The learned strategies closely match the PDE benchmark and remain stable across initial conditions. The results highlight the relevance of policy-gradient techniques for dividend optimisation under self-exciting claim dynamics and point toward scalable methods for higher-dimensional extensions.

Abstract: This paper studies distributed convex optimization with both affine equality and nonlinear inequality couplings through the duality analysis. We first formulate the dual of the coupling-constraint problem and reformulate it as a consensus optimization problem over a connected network. To efficiently solve this dual problem and hence the primal problem, we design an accelerated linearized algorithm that, at each round, a look-ahead linearization of the separable objective is combined with a quadratic penalty on the Laplacian constraint, a proximal step, and an aggregation of iterations. On the theory side, we prove non-ergodic rates for both the primal optimality error and the feasibility error. On the other hand, numerical experiments show a faster decrease of optimality error and feasibility residual than augmented-Lagrangian tracking and distributed subgradient baselines under the same communication budget.

Abstract: We study distributed convex optimization with two ubiquitous forms of coupling: consensus constraints and global affine equalities. We first design a linearized method of multipliers for the consensus optimization problem. Without smoothness or strong convexity, we establish non-ergodic sublinear rates of order O(1/\sqrt{k}) for both the objective optimality and the consensus violation. Leveraging duality, we then show that the economic dispatch problem admits a dual consensus formulation, and that applying the same algorithm to the dual economic dispatch yields non-ergodic O(1/\sqrt{k}) decay for the error of the summation of the cost over the network and the equality-constraint residual under convexity and Slater's condition. Numerical results on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate faster reduction of both objective error and feasibility error relative to the state-of-the-art baselines, while the dual variables reach network-wide consensus.

Many existing distributed algorithms rely on solving local subproblems via the $\operatorname{argmin}$ operator in each iteration. Such approaches become computationally burdensome or intractable when local cost functions are complex. To address this challenge, we propose a novel distributed gradient-based algorithm that avoids solving a local optimization problem at each iteration by leveraging first-order approximations and projection onto local feasible sets. The algorithm operates in a fully distributed manner, requiring only local communication without exchanging gradients or primal variables. We rigorously establish sublinear convergence for general convex cost functions and linear convergence under strong convexity and smoothness conditions. Numerical simulation on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrates the superior computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art distributed optimization algorithms.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文研究了L$^\natural$-凸函数及其变体的最小化问题，提出了有效的线性不等式，给出了对应epigraph的凸包描述，并发现了混合整数规划中已知结构的隐藏L$^\natural$-凸性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: L$^\natural$-凸函数在一般整数域上包含大量非线性函数，在现实应用中广泛存在。研究其最小化问题有助于解决实际优化问题。

Method: 针对不同类别的L$^\natural$-凸函数最小化问题，提出有效线性不等式，分析facet条件，开发精确分离方法，并分析分离问题的复杂度。

Result: 发现了混合整数规划中已知结构（如混合集和连续混合集）的隐藏L$^\natural$-凸性，结果涵盖了这些集合的现有多面体结果，并为连续混合集的多容量变体建立了新结果。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了L$^\natural$-凸函数最小化的理论框架，为混合整数规划中的相关结构提供了新的理论洞察和算法工具。

Abstract: L$^\natural$ (natural)-convex functions encompass a large class of nonlinear functions over general integer domains and arise in a wide range of real-world applications. We explore the minimization of L$^\natural$-convex functions, of multiple L$^\natural$-convex functions with common variables, and of a mixed-integer extension of L$^\natural$-convex functions -- functions defined over a mixed-integer domain with properties that resemble L$^\natural$-convexity. For each of these families of minimization problems, we propose valid linear inequalities and provide convex hull descriptions for the corresponding epigraphs. For all classes of proposed inequalities, we discuss their facet conditions, develop exact separation methods, and analyze the complexity of the separation problem. We discover hidden L$^\natural$-convexity in well-known mixed-integer structures in the integer programming literature, namely the (general integer) mixing set and the continuous mixing set. We show that our findings subsume the existing polyhedral results for these sets and establish new results for the multi-capacity variant of the continuous mixing set.

Result: 证明了FBSDE的局部适定性，HMFG存在唯一均衡，且该均衡是相应N玩家博弈的良好近似均衡。

Conclusion: 推导了无限维测度流的Itô公式，并利用其获得了作为无限维FBSDE系统解耦场的HMFG主方程。

Abstract: Motivated by the recent interests in asymmetric mean field games, this paper provides a general framework of Heterogeneous Mean Field Game (HMFG) that subsumes different formulations of graphon mean field games. The key feature of the HMFG is that the players interact with the population through the density ensemble. In this case, the HMFG system becomes an infinite-dimensional Forward-Backward SDE (FBSDE) system. We show that the FBSDE is locally well-posed, thus the HMFG has a unique equilibrium. In addition, we show that the equilibrium of HMFG is a good approximate equilibrium of the corresponding N-Player Game. Lastly, we derive the Itô formula of infinite-dimensional measure flow and use it to obtain the master equation for HMFG as a decoupling field of the infinite-dimensional FBSDE system.

Motivation: 随机梯度方法在系统辨识和机器学习中至关重要，但在非持续激励条件下，现有的强一致性收敛结果存在理论缺口，已知的收敛条件限制在α≤1/3，而α>1时已知会失效，这限制了算法的应用范围。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient methods are of fundamental importance in system identification and machine learning, enabling online parameter estimation for large-scale and data-streaming processes. The stochastic gradient algorithm stands as a classical identification method that has been extensively studied for decades. Under non-persistent excitation, the best known convergence result requires the condition number of the Fisher information matrix to satisfy $κ(\sum_{i=1}^n \varphi_i \varphi_i^\top) = O((\log r_n)^α)$, where $r_n = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^n \|\varphi_i\|^2$, with strong consistency guaranteed for $α\leq 1/3$ but known to fail for $α> 1$. This paper establishes that strong consistency in fact holds for the entire range $0 \leq α< 1$, achieved through a novel algebraic framework that yields substantially sharper matrix norm bounds. Our result nearly resolves the four-decade-old conjecture of Chen and Guo (1986), bridging the theoretical gap from $α\leq 1/3$ to nearly the entire feasible range.

Then a local parametrization and a local system of coordinates is provided using a diffeomorphism between this set of state feedback matrices and the orbit space of a set of truncated observability matrices via de action of a Lie group.

Motivation: 研究切换线性系统价值函数的可微性，因为这对最优控制和强化学习具有重要意义，影响价值函数的精确计算方法。

Method: 通过理论分析和构造反例，证明价值函数在状态空间稠密子集上的不可微性。

Result: 价值函数在成本函数Lipschitz连续时是Lipschitz连续的，但即使在光滑成本函数下，也可能在稠密子集上不可微。

Conclusion: 切换线性系统的价值函数计算需要使用包含在稠密子集上不可微函数的模板，这对最优控制和强化学习算法设计有重要影响。

Abstract: This paper studies the differentiability of the value function of switched linear systems under arbitrary switching and controlled switching, referred to as worst-case and optimal value functions respectively. First, we show that the value functions are Lipschitz continuous, when the cost function is Lipschitz continuous. Then, as the central contribution of this work, we show with examples that each of these functions can be non-differentiable on dense subsets of the state space, even if the cost function is smooth and Lipschitz continuous. This has implications for optimal control and reinforcement learning since it implies that the exact computation of these value functions requires templates involving functions that are non-differentiable on dense subsets.

Conclusion: 多周期分布鲁棒优化问题在连续时间极限下具有明确的半群结构，Wasserstein不确定性在极限中表现为生成元的附加扰动项，为连续时间鲁棒优化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We examine the scaling limit of multi-period distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems via a semigroup approach. Each period involves a worst-case maximization over distributions in a Wasserstein ball around the transition probability of a reference process with radius proportional to the length of the period, and the multi-period DRO problem arises through its sequential composition. We show that the scaling limit of the multi-period DRO, as the length of each period tends to zero, is a strongly continuous monotone semigroup on $\mathrm{C_b}$. Furthermore, we show that its infinitesimal generator is equal to the generator associated with the non-robust scaling limit plus an additional perturbation term induced by the Wasserstein uncertainty. As an application, we show that when the reference process follows an Itô process, the viscosity solution of the associated nonlinear PDE coincides with the value of continuous-time robust optimization problems under parametric uncertainty.

Conclusion: SSQP系列算法为非线性函数约束的随机凸优化问题提供了高效解决方案，在理论和实验性能上都表现出色。

Abstract: Stochastic convex optimization problems with nonlinear functional constraints are ubiquitous in machine learning applications, including multi-task learning, structured prediction, and multi-view learning. The presence of nonlinear functional constraints renders the traditional projected stochastic gradient descent and related projection-based methods inefficient, and motivates the use of first-order methods. However, existing first-order methods, including primal and primal-dual algorithms, typically rely on a bounded (sub-)gradient assumption, which may be too restrictive in many settings.
  We propose a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) algorithm that works entirely in the primal domain, avoids projecting onto the feasible region, obviates the need for bounded gradients, and achieves state-of-the-art oracle complexity under standard smoothness and convexity assumptions. A faster version, namely SSQP-Skip, is also proposed where the quadratic subproblems can be skipped in most iterations. Finally, we develop an accelerated variance-reduced version of SSQP (VARAS), whose oracle complexity bounds match those for solving unconstrained finite-sum convex optimization problems. The superior performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated via numerical experiments on real datasets.

Abstract: We study a continuous-time dynamical system which arises as the limit of a broad class of nonlinearly preconditioned gradient methods. Under mild assumptions, we establish existence of global solutions and derive Lyapunov-based convergence guarantees. For convex costs, we prove a sublinear decay in a geometry induced by some reference function, and under a generalized gradient-dominance condition we obtain exponential convergence. We further uncover a duality connection with mirror descent, and use it to establish that the flow of interest solves an infinite-horizon optimal-control problem of which the value function is the Bregman divergence generated by the cost. These results clarify the structure and optimization behavior of nonlinearly preconditioned gradient flows and connect them to known continuous-time models in non-Euclidean optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel online optimization algorithm built by combining ideas from control theory and system identification. The foundation of our algorithm is a control-based design that makes use of the internal model of the online problem. Since such prior knowledge of this internal model might not be available in practice, we incorporate an identification routine that learns this model on the fly. The algorithm is designed starting from quadratic online problems but can be applied to general problems. For quadratic cases, we characterize the asymptotic convergence to the optimal solution trajectory. We compare the proposed algorithm with existing approaches, and demonstrate how the identification routine ensures its adaptability to changes in the underlying internal model. Numerical results also indicate strong performance beyond the quadratic setting.

Abstract: The predict-then-optimize paradigm bridges online learning and contextual optimization in dynamic environments. Previous works have investigated the sequential updating of predictors using feedback from downstream decisions to minimize regret in the full-information settings. However, existing approaches are predominantly frequentist, rely heavily on gradient-based strategies, and employ deterministic predictors that could yield high variance in practice despite their asymptotic guarantees. This work introduces, to the best of our knowledge, the first Bayesian online contextual optimization framework. Grounded in PAC-Bayes theory and general Bayesian updating principles, our framework achieves $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for bounded and mixable losses via a Gibbs posterior, eliminates the dependence on gradients through sequential Monte Carlo samplers, and thereby accommodates nondifferentiable problems. Theoretical developments and numerical experiments substantiate our claims.

Abstract: We study the optimization of functions with $n>2$ arguments that have a representation as a sum of several functions that have only $2$ of the $n$ arguments each, termed sums of bivariates, on finite domains. The complexity of optimizing sums of bivariates is shown to be NP-equivalent and it is shown that there exists free lunch in the optimization of sums of bivariates. Based on measure-valued extensions of the objective function, so-called relaxations, $\ell^2$-approximation, and entropy-regularization, we derive several tractable problem formulations solvable with linear programming, coordinate ascent as well as with closed-form solutions. The limits of applying tractable versions of such relaxations to sums of bivariates are investigated using general results for reconstructing measures from their bivariate marginals. Experiments in which the derived algorithms are applied to random functions, vertex coloring, and signal reconstruction problems provide insights into qualitatively different function classes that can be modeled as sums of bivariates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动车普及将对电力系统产生重要影响，需要准确建模来理解这些挑战和机遇。传统聚合建模会丢失信息，因此需要研究使用多个独立BEV档案的建模方法。

Method: 采用包含数十个独立BEV档案的建模方法，研究不同档案数量对结果准确性和计算效率的影响，并分析档案选择对最优结果的影响。

Result: 过少的BEV档案会导致最优解失真，但超过一定阈值后增加档案数量对结果稳健性提升有限。对于500万至2000万辆BEV车队，每个档案代表20-25万辆车可确保准确结果且避免过度计算时间。

Conclusion: 在电动车充电建模中，使用足够数量的独立BEV档案至关重要，推荐每个档案代表20-25万辆车，这样既能保证准确性又不会显著增加计算负担。

Abstract: Electrifying passenger cars will impact future power systems. To understand the challenges and opportunities that arise, it is necessary to reflect "sector coupling" in the modeling space. This paper focuses on a specific modeling approach that includes dozens of individual BEV profiles rather than one aggregated BEV profile. Although including additional BEV profiles increases model complexity and runtime, it avoids losing information in the aggregation process. We investigate how many profiles are needed to ensure the accuracy of the results and the extent to which fewer profiles can be traded for runtime efficiency gains. We also examine whether selecting specific profiles influences optimal results. We demonstrate that including too few profiles may result in distorted optimal solutions. However, beyond a certain threshold, adding more profiles does not significantly enhance the robustness of the results. More generally, for fleets of 5 to 20 million BEVs, we derive a rule of thumb consisting in including enough profiles such that each profile represents 200,000 to 250,000 vehicles, ensuring accurate results without excessive runtime.

Abstract: The paper addresses a continuous-time continuous-space chance-constrained stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem where the probability of failure to satisfy given state constraints is explicitly bounded. We leverage the notion of exit time from continuous-time stochastic calculus to formulate a chance-constrained SOC problem. Without any conservative approximation, the chance constraint is transformed into an expectation of an indicator function which can be incorporated into the cost function by considering a dual formulation. We then express the dual function in terms of the solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation parameterized by the dual variable. Under a certain assumption on the system dynamics and cost function, it is shown that a strong duality holds between the primal chance-constrained problem and its dual. The Path integral approach is utilized to numerically solve the dual problem via gradient ascent using open-loop samples of system trajectories. We present simulation studies on chance-constrained motion planning for spatial navigation of mobile robots and the solution of the path integral approach is compared with that of the finite difference method.

Abstract: This paper presents a closed-loop framework for conflict-free routing and scheduling of multi-aircraft in Terminal Manoeuvring Areas (TMA), aimed at reducing congestion and enhancing landing efficiency. Leveraging data-driven arrival inputs (either historical or predicted), we formulate a mixed-integer optimization model for real-time control, incorporating an extended TMA network spanning a 50-nautical-mile radius around Changi Airport. The model enforces safety separation, speed adjustments, and holding time constraints while maximizing runway throughput. A rolling-horizon Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy enables closed-loop integration with a traffic simulator, dynamically updating commands based on real-time system states and predictions. Computational efficiency is validated across diverse traffic scenarios, demonstrating a 7-fold reduction in computation time during peak congestion compared to onetime optimization, using Singapore ADS-B dataset. Monte Carlo simulations under travel time disturbances further confirm the framework's robustness. Results highlight the approach's operational resilience and computational scalability, offering actionable decision support for Air Traffic Controller Officers (ATCOs) through real-time optimization and adaptive replanning.

Conclusion: 这种"先聚类后路径规划"的分解策略为大规模多智能体任务分配提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The Multi-Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) is a commonly used mathematical model for multi-agent task allocation. However, as the number of agents and task targets increases, existing optimization-based methods often incur prohibitive computational costs, posing significant challenges to large-scale coordination in unmanned systems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a K-means-inspired task allocation framework that reformulates the MTSP as a spatially constrained classification process. By leveraging spatial coherence, the proposed method enables fast estimation of path costs and efficient task grouping, thereby fundamentally reducing overall computational complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the framework can maintain high solution quality even in extremely large-scale scenarios-for instance, in tasks involving 1000 agents and 5000 targets. The findings indicate that this "cluster-then-route" decomposition strategy offers an efficient and reliable solution for large-scale multi-agent task allocation.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of resilient control for multi-agent systems in the presence of Byzantine adversaries via an active secure neighbor selection framework. A pre-discriminative graph is first constructed to characterize the admissible set of candidate neighbors for each agent. Based on this graph, a dynamic in-neighbor selection strategy is proposed, wherein each agent actively selects a subset of its pre-discriminative neighbors. The number of selected neighbors is adjustable, allowing for a trade-off between communication overhead and robustness, with the minimal case requiring only a single in-neighbor. The proposed strategy facilitates the reconstruction of a directed spanning tree among normal agents following the detection and isolation of Byzantine agents. It achieves resilient consensus without imposing any assumptions on the initial connectivity among normal agents. Moreover, the approach significantly reduces communication burden while maintaining resilience to adversarial behavior. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, a state feedback control design with min/max operational limiting constraints is developed for multi-input-multi-output linear time invariant systems. Specifically, servo-tracking control problems with input and output constraints are considered. For static servo-controllers, the output design limits are imposed component-wise on the system selected output, which is of the same dimension as the control input. For dynamic servo-controllers, operational constraints are applied to the system inputs and outputs. The proposed control solution also includes an anti-windup protection logic for dynamic servo-controllers with integral action. The developed method is based on the Nagumo Theorem for forward invariance, the Comparison Lemma for inclusion of input/output inequality constraints, and on the min-norm optimal controllers for synthesis. The derived design is similar and directly related to the method of Control Barrier Functions. Simulation trade studies are presented to illustrate benefits of the proposed control methodology for aerial flight critical systems.

Abstract: Decarbonisation, decentralisation, and intermittency are driving the development of flexibility markets towards shorter market time units (MTU). Shorter MTUs and shorter gate closures lower the entrance barriers of demand side aggregators that face significant uncertainty on longer time scales. We study the business case for aggregated EV fleets participating in the Nordic 15-minute mFRR Energy Activation Market (EAM). Motivated by increasing system granularity and rapid EV uptake, we represent fleet flexibility as a virtual battery with time-varying power and energy envelopes and formulate a risk-aware stochastic optimisation that co-ordinates day-ahead scheduling with quarter-hour mFRR bidding. Using synthetic residential charging cohorts and observed day-ahead prices on two stylised days, we compare an independent day-ahead baseline to a co-optimised strategy under conservative availability and a CVaR-augmented objective. Across both price cases, co-optimisation increases expected profit and lowers downside risk: the model buys less energy day-ahead and shifts procurement toward mFRR down while flattening the charging plan to retain eligibility for mFRR up. Profit decomposition shows that the uplift is driven by higher mFRR down revenues and reduced reliance on unwinding day-ahead positions. We discuss operational implications for bidding and outline two extensions: rolling 45-minute re-optimisation and a V2G framework.

Abstract: Autonomous robots relying on radio frequency (RF)-based localization such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS), ultra-wide band (UWB), and 5G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are vulnerable to spoofing and sensor manipulation. This paper presents a resilient navigation architecture that combines multi-hypothesis estimation with a Poisson binomial windowed-count detector for anomaly identification and isolation. A state machine coordinates transitions between operation, diagnosis, and mitigation, enabling adaptive response to adversarial conditions. When attacks are detected, trajectory re-planning based on differential flatness allows information-gathering maneuvers minimizing performance loss. Case studies demonstrate effective detection of biased sensors, maintenance of state estimation, and recovery of nominal operation under persistent spoofing attacks

Abstract: This work addresses electric vehicle (EV) charging station placement through a bi-level optimization model, where the upper-level planner maximizes net revenue by selecting station locations under budget constraints, while EV users at the lower level choose routes and charging stations to minimize travel and charging costs. To account for range anxiety, we construct a battery-expanded network and apply a shortest path algorithm with Frank-Wolfe traffic assignment. Our primary contribution is developing the first exact solution algorithm for large scale EV charging station placement problems. We propose a Branch-and-Price-and-Cut algorithm enhanced with value function cuts and column generation. While existing research relies on heuristic methods that provide no optimality guarantees or exact algorithms that require prohibitively long runtimes, our exact algorithm delivers globally optimal solutions with mathematical certainty under a reasonable runtime. Computational experiments on the Eastern Massachusetts network (74 nodes, 248 links), the Anaheim network (416 nodes, 914 links), and the Barcelona network (110 zones, 1,020 nodes, and 2,512 links) demonstrate exceptional performance. Our algorithm terminates within minutes rather than hours, while achieving optimality gaps below 1% across all instances. This result represents a computational speedup of over two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods. The algorithm successfully handles problems with over 300,000 feasible combinations, which transform EV charging infrastructure planning from a computationally prohibitive problem into a tractable optimization task suitable for practical decision making problem for real world networks.

Abstract: Optimizing modern wireless networks is exceptionally challenging due to their high dynamism and complexity. While the agentic artificial intelligence (AI) powered by reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution, its practical application is limited by prohibitive exploration costs and potential risks in the real world. The emerging digital twin (DT) technology provides a safe and controlled virtual environment for agentic AI training, but its effectiveness critically depends on the DT's fidelity. Policies trained in a low-fidelity DT that does not accurately represent the physical network may experience severe performance degradation upon real-world deployment. In this article, we introduce a unified DT evaluation framework to ensure trustworthy DTs in agentic AI-based network optimization. This evaluation framework shifts from conventional isolated physical accuracy metrics, such as wireless channel and user trajectory similarities, to a more holistic, task-centric DT assessment. We demonstrate it as an effective guideline for design, selection, and lifecycle management of wireless network DTs. A comprehensive case study on a real-world wireless network testbed shows how this evaluation framework is used to pre-filter candidate DTs, leading to a significant reduction in training and testing costs without sacrificing deployment performance. Finally, potential research opportunities are discussed.

Abstract: A vital strategy for ports to mitigate the environmental impact of the maritime industry, while complying with frameworks such as the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), entails the systematic implementation of comprehensive energy management solutions. This paper provides a baseline evaluation of the energy management systems (EMSs) implementation and their impact on energy consumption, carbon emissions, and operational costs in smart ports. Initially, we provide a systematic review of the literature focusing on case studies from prominent ports, including Hamburg, Genoa, Jurong, and Shanghai Yangshan Phase IV. The analysis emphasises key aspects such as energy efficiency, reductions in emissions, and the minimization of operational costs. Subsequently, we formulate an optimisation model to simulate load dispatch, carbon emission reduction, and transport scheduling. Results indicate that EMS deployment reduces annual energy consumption and carbon emissions significantly by approximately 7%-8% and 11%-12% respectively, while achieving substantial cost savings of 30%. The study also identifies critical challenges, including system integration, data quality issues, cybersecurity risks, and the need for standardization. These findings provide valuable insights for port authorities and policymakers, supporting the transition toward more sustainable and efficient port operations.

Conclusion: 量子增强的强化学习方法能有效改善牛顿-拉夫逊法在电力系统潮流计算中的性能表现。

Abstract: The Newton-Raphson (NR) method is widely used for solving power flow (PF) equations due to its quadratic convergence. However, its performance deteriorates under poor initialization or extreme operating scenarios, e.g., high levels of renewable energy penetration. Traditional NR initialization strategies often fail to address these challenges, resulting in slow convergence or even divergence. We propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the initialization of NR, and introduce a novel quantum-enhanced RL environment update mechanism to mitigate the significant computational cost of evaluating power system states over a combinatorially large action space at each RL timestep by formulating the voltage adjustment task as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. Specifically, quantum/digital annealers are integrated into the RL environment update to evaluate state transitions using a problem Hamiltonian designed for PF. Results demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed, a reduction in NR iteration counts, and enhanced robustness under different operating conditions.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在多目标跟踪中有效处理了目标间遮挡问题，通过期望检测概率的分配提高了跟踪性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses multi-object systems, where objects may occlude one another relative to the sensor. The standard point-object model for detection-based sensors is enhanced so that the probability of detection considers the presence of all objects. A principled tracking method is derived, assigning each object an expected probability of detection, where the expectation is taken over the reduced Palm density, which means conditionally on the object's existence. The assigned probability thus considers the object's visibility relative to the sensor, under the presence of other objects. Unlike existing methods, the proposed method systematically accounts for uncertainties related to all objects in a clear and manageable way. The method is demonstrated through a visual tracking application using the multi-Bernoulli mixture (MBM) filter with marks.

Conclusion: LLM智能体能够可靠地加速TSA研究，从场景生成到模型设计的全流程自动化，为电力系统其他任务提供了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: This paper presents an LLM-driven, end-to-end workflow that addresses the lack of automation and intelligence in power system transient stability assessment (TSA). The proposed agentic framework integrates large language models (LLMs) with a professional simulator (ANDES) to automatically generate and filter disturbance scenarios from natural language, and employs an LLM-driven Neural Network Design (LLM-NND) pipeline to autonomously design and optimize TSA models through performance-guided, closed-loop feedback. On the IEEE 39-bus system, the LLM-NND models achieve 93.71% test accuracy on four-class TSA with only 4.78M parameters, while maintaining real-time inference latency (less than 0.95 ms per sample). Compared with a manually designed DenseNet (25.9M parameters, 80.05% accuracy), the proposed approach jointly improves accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy among domain-grounded retrieval, reasoning augmentation, and feedback mechanisms is essential for robust automation. The results demonstrate that LLM agents can reliably accelerate TSA research from scenario generation and data acquisition to model design and interpretation, offering a scalable paradigm that is readily extensible to other power system tasks such as optimal power flow, fault analysis, and market operations.

Abstract: Tracking maneuvering targets requires estimators that are both responsive and robust. Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filters are a standard tracking approach, but fusing models via Gaussian mixtures can lag during maneuvers. Recent winnertakes-all (WTA) approaches react quickly but may produce discontinuities. We propose SAFE-IMM, a lightweight IMM variant for tracking on mobile and resource-limited platforms with a safe covariance-aware gate that permits WTA only when the implied jump from the mixture to the winner is provably bounded. In simulations and on nuScenes front-radar data, SAFE-IMM achieves high accuracy at real-time rates, reducing ID switches while maintaining competitive performance. The method is simple to integrate, numerically stable, and clutter-robust, offering a practical balance between responsiveness and smoothness.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning-based framework that accelerates time- and energy-optimal trajectory planning for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) using graph neural networks (GNNs). We formulate the multi-agent coordination problem encountered in traffic scenarios as a cooperative trajectory planning problem that minimizes travel time, subject to motion primitives derived from energy-optimal solutions. The effectiveness of this framework can be further improved through replanning at each time step, enabling the system to incorporate newly observed information. To achieve real-time execution of such a multi-agent replanning scheme, we employ a GNN architecture to learn the solutions of the time-optimal trajectory planning problem from offline-generated data. The trained model produces online predictions that serve as warm-start solutions for numerical optimization, thereby enabling rapid computation of minimal exit times and the associated feasible trajectories. This learning-augmented approach substantially reduces computation time while ensuring that all state, input, and safety constraints are satisfied.

Abstract: Continuous piecewise affine (CPA) Lyapunov function synthesis is one method to perform Lyapunov stability analysis for nonlinear systems. This method first generates a mesh over the region of interest in the system's state space and then solves a linear program (LP), which enforces constraints on each vertex of the mesh, to synthesize a Lyapunov function. Finer meshes broaden the class of Lyapunov function candidates, but CPA function synthesis is more computationally expensive for finer meshes -- particularly so in higher dimensional systems. This paper explores methods to mesh the region of interest more efficiently so that a Lyapunov function can be synthesized using less computational effort. Three methods are explored -- adaptive meshing, meshing using knowledge of the system model, and a combination of the two. Numerical examples for two and three dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems are used to compare the efficacy of the three methods.

Abstract: Barrier functions (BFs) characterize safe sets of dynamical systems, where hard constraints are never violated as the system evolves over time. Computing a valid safe set and BF for a nonlinear (and potentially unmodeled), non-autonomous dynamical system is a difficult task. This work explores the design of BFs using data to obtain safe sets with deterministic assurances of control invariance. We leverage ReLU neural networks (NNs) to create continuous piecewise affine (CPA) BFs with deterministic safety guarantees for Lipschitz continuous, discrete-time dynamical system using sampled one-step trajectories. The CPA structure admits a novel classifier term to create a relaxed \ac{bf} condition and construction via a data driven constrained optimization. We use iterative convex overbounding (ICO) to solve this nonconvex optimization problem through a series of convex optimization steps. We then demonstrate our method's efficacy on two-dimensional autonomous and non-autonomous dynamical systems.

*Elise Zhang,François Mirallès,Stéphane Dellacherie,Di Wu,Benoit Boulet*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文研究因果特征选择在短期负荷预测中的应用，通过比较不同特征选择方法，发现因果选择能保留最关键的天气驱动因素，提高模型简洁性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天气是住宅电力需求的主要外部驱动因素，但添加过多气象协变量会增加模型复杂度并可能降低准确性。需要一种原则性的特征选择框架来优化预测性能。

Method: 使用南安大略省的两个开源数据集，比较三种特征选择方法（无选择、非因果选择、PCMCI因果选择）在三种时间序列预测模型（GRU、TCN、PatchTST）上的表现。

Result: 非因果选择优先考虑辐射和湿度等相关性变量，而因果选择强调更直接的热驱动因素并修剪间接协变量，在预测准确性和极端天气鲁棒性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 因果特征选择是现代预测器在整合天气因素到住宅负荷预测时的实用补充方法，能够提高模型的简洁性和稳健性。

Abstract: Weather is a dominant external driver of residential electricity demand, but adding many meteorological covariates can inflate model complexity and may even impair accuracy. Selecting appropriate exogenous features is non-trivial and calls for a principled selection framework, given the direct operational implications for day-to-day planning and reliability. This work investigates whether causal feature selection can retain the most informative weather drivers while improving parsimony and robustness for short-term load forecasting. We present a case study on Southern Ontario with two open-source datasets: (i) IESO hourly electricity consumption by Forward Sortation Areas; (ii) ERA5 weather reanalysis data. We compare different feature selection regimes (no feature selection, non-causal selection, PCMCI-causal selection) on city-level forecasting with three different time series forecasting models: GRU, TCN, PatchTST. In the feature analysis, non-causal selection prioritizes radiation and moisture variables that show correlational dependence, whereas PCMCI-causal selection emphasizes more direct thermal drivers and prunes the indirect covariates. We detail the evaluation pipeline and report diagnostics on prediction accuracy and extreme-weather robustness, positioning causal feature selection as a practical complement to modern forecasters when integrating weather into residential load forecasting.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出RFE-DMDc工作流，使用递归特征消除选择最小变量集，通过动态模态分解建立线性状态空间模型，在计算效率上比遗传算法基准方法快一个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多工程系统难以通过第一性原理建模，需要数据驱动方法为数字孪生提供控制和诊断支持。

Method: 结合递归特征消除(RFE)进行变量选择，使用动态模态分解与控制(DMDc)建立状态空间模型，包含跨子系统选择步骤以避免特征遮蔽。

Result: 在RLC基准测试和集成能源系统上，RFE-DMDc能恢复约10个变量的紧凑状态集，测试误差与GA-DMDc相当，计算时间减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法选择的变量具有清晰的物理解释，所得模型在预测精度、计算效率和抗过拟合方面表现优异。

Abstract: The behavior of a dynamical system under a given set of inputs can be captured by tracking the response of an optimal subset of process variables (\textit{state variables}). For many engineering systems, however, first-principles, model-based identification is impractical, motivating data-driven approaches for Digital Twins used in control and diagnostics. In this paper, we present RFE-DMDc, a supervised, data-driven workflow that uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select a minimal, physically meaningful set of variables to monitor and then derives a linear state-space model via Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc). The workflow includes a cross-subsystem selection step that mitigates feature \textit{overshadowing} in multi-component systems. To corroborate the results, we implement a GA-DMDc baseline that jointly optimizes the state set and model fit under a common accuracy cost on states and outputs. Across a truth-known RLC benchmark and a realistic Integrated Energy System (IES) with multiple thermally coupled components and thousands of candidate variables, RFE-DMDc consistently recovers compact state sets (\(\approx 10\) variables) that achieve test errors comparable to GA-DMDc while requiring an order of magnitude less computational time. The selected variables retain clear physical interpretation across subsystems, and the resulting models demonstrate competitive predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to overfitting.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该研究评估了旧金山湾区城市空中交通(UAM)的可行性，通过多智能体模拟比较了UAM与传统地面交通的出行时间，发现在高峰需求时段UAM可减少高达80%的总出行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动垂直起降(eVTOL)车辆的发展，城市空中交通有望缓解城市交通拥堵问题，提供更快的点对点空中出租车服务。

Method: 在MATLAB中开发多智能体模拟，使用泊松过程模拟随机乘客流和周转约束下的需求到达，评估机队运营。

Result: 在高峰需求时段使用UAM可将区域内的总出行时间减少高达80%。

Conclusion: 机队规模、乘客请求量和周转时间等关键运营因素直接影响等待时间、运营成本和用户接受度，是机队调度优化的关键因素。

Abstract: Urban Air mobility has gained momentum with recent advancements in the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles, offering faster point-to-point air taxi services that could help relieve traffic congestion in chronically overburdened cities. The research assesses the feasibility and systems-of-systems level adoption potential of UAM operations in the San Francisco Bay Area by comparing passenger departure, waiting, travel, and arrival times across key regional nodes, including San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, and Palo Alto airports, with conventional ground transportation. A multi-agent simulation was developed in MATLAB to evaluate the fleet operations and to model demand arrival using a Poisson process under stochastic passenger flows and turnaround constraints. Results indicate that utilizing UAM during peak demand could reduce total travel times up to eighty percent across the region. The findings of this paper highlight the critical operational factors for fleet schedule optimization. Especially how the fleet size, passengers' request volumes, and turnaround time directly influence waiting time, operating cost, and overall user acceptance.

TL;DR: 研究评估了GenAI在加纳STEAM教育中的文化响应能力，发现结合CRLP工具后能生成比国家标准教案更具文化相关性的课程，但在文化多元性和数学计算领域的文化细微差别方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨GenAI在Global South地区STEAM教育中的文化语境化能力，特别是在加纳这样的多元文化环境中如何实现文化响应式教学。

Method: 采用收敛混合方法设计，四位STEAM专家使用验证的25项文化响应教学法评分表，评估GenAI生成的课程计划与国家标准课程计划的差异，并结合定性反思分析。

Result: GenAI结合CRLP工具能生成比国家标准教案更具文化基础和教学响应性的课程，整合了本土知识、双语元素和本地相关案例，但在文化多元性和数学计算领域的文化细微差别方面表现不足。

Conclusion: GenAI在支持文化响应式STEAM教学方面具有潜力，但需要教师调解、社区参与和AI输出的文化调适，未来应进行课堂试验、扩大专家参与和基于本土语言语料库的模型微调。

Abstract: This study investigates how human experts evaluate the capacity of Generative AI (GenAI) to contextualize STEAM education in the Global South, with a focus on Ghana. Using a convergent mixed-methods design, four STEAM specialists assessed GenAI-generated lesson plans created with a customized Culturally Responsive Lesson Planner (CRLP) and compared them to standardized lesson plans from the Ghana National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA). Quantitative ratings were based on a validated 25-item Culturally Responsive Pedagogy Rubric measuring bias awareness, cultural representation, contextual relevance, linguistic responsiveness, and teacher agency. Qualitative reflections provided additional insight into how GenAI handles cultural and pedagogical appropriateness.
  Findings show that GenAI, when paired with the CRLP tool, can support contextualized STEAM instruction by linking abstract curriculum standards to learners' cultural knowledge, community practices, and everyday experiences. Experts rated GenAI-assisted lessons as more culturally grounded and pedagogically responsive than NaCCA plans, integrating Indigenous knowledge, bilingual elements, and locally relevant examples. However, GenAI struggled to represent Ghana's cultural pluralism, often offering surface-level references to language, history, and identity. These weaknesses were most evident in Mathematics and Computing, where cultural nuance was limited. The results highlight the need for continued teacher mediation, community involvement, and culturally attuned refinement of AI outputs. Future work should include classroom trials, expanded expert participation, and model fine-tuning using Indigenous language corpora to strengthen cultural fidelity in Global South contexts.

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个包含134,136个由GPT-4、Gemma 2和Llama 3.1生成的LLM说服攻击数据集，分析了不同模型使用的道德共鸣策略，旨在帮助组织建立主动防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型能够快速大规模生成有说服力的内容，与官方信息形成竞争叙事，使组织处于被动防御地位，难以维持沟通效果。

Method: 创建大型LLM生成的说服攻击数据集，包含134,136个攻击，涵盖23种说服技术，针对10个机构的972份新闻稿，以新闻稿声明和社交媒体帖子两种形式呈现。

Result: 不同LLM模型使用不同的道德共鸣策略：GPT-4主要关注关怀，同时涉及权威和忠诚；Gemma 2强调关怀和权威；Llama 3.1以忠诚和关怀为中心。

Conclusion: 分析LLM生成的说服攻击有助于建立主动防御机制，为组织创建声誉防护，推动信息生态系统中有效且有弹性的沟通发展。

Abstract: Organization's communication is essential for public trust, but the rise of generative AI models has introduced significant challenges by generating persuasive content that can form competing narratives with official messages from government and commercial organizations at speed and scale. This has left agencies in a reactive position, often unaware of how these models construct their persuasive strategies, making it more difficult to sustain communication effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce a large LLM-generated persuasion attack dataset, which includes 134,136 attacks generated by GPT-4, Gemma 2, and Llama 3.1 on agency news. These attacks span 23 persuasive techniques from SemEval 2023 Task 3, directed toward 972 press releases from ten agencies. The generated attacks come in two mediums, press release statements and social media posts, covering both long-form and short-form communication strategies. We analyzed the moral resonance of these persuasion attacks to understand their attack vectors. GPT-4's attacks mainly focus on Care, with Authority and Loyalty also playing a role. Gemma 2 emphasizes Care and Authority, while Llama 3.1 centers on Loyalty and Care. Analyzing LLM-generated persuasive attacks across models will enable proactive defense, allow to create the reputation armor for organizations, and propel the development of both effective and resilient communications in the information ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着METR时间跨度指标和计算能力的指数级增长，作者关注计算能力扩展是否能持续到2030年，以及可能的计算放缓如何影响AI智能体能力预测。

Method: 建立时间跨度作为训练计算和算法函数的模型，结合计算投资如何促进算法进步的模型，利用2019-2025年间时间跨度和计算能力以恒定速率增长的经验事实进行推导。

Result: 推导出时间跨度增长必须与计算增长成比例，并提供有限的实验证据支持这一理论。使用该模型在OpenAI的计算预测下进行时间跨度增长预测。

Conclusion: 在计算增长放缓的情况下，时间跨度增长将显著延迟，例如80%可靠性的1个月时间跨度比简单趋势外推预测晚7年实现。

Abstract: METR's time horizon metric has grown exponentially since 2019, along with compute. However, it is unclear whether compute scaling will persist at current rates through 2030, raising the question of how possible compute slowdowns might impact AI agent capability forecasts. Given a model of time horizon as a function of training compute and algorithms, along with a model of how compute investment spills into algorithmic progress (which, notably, precludes the possibility of a software-only singularity), and the empirical fact that both time horizon and compute have grown at constant rates over 2019--2025, we derive that time horizon growth must be proportional to compute growth. We provide additional, albeit limited, experimental evidence consistent with this theory. We use our model to project time horizon growth under OpenAI's compute projection, finding substantial projected delays in some cases. For example, 1-month time horizons at $80\%$ reliability occur $7$ years later than simple trend extrapolation suggests.

Motivation: 生成式AI在教育中的广泛应用给教师带来适应挑战，虽然提供了可及性、可扩展性和生产力机会，但也引发了对教师自主权减少、认知能力退化和教师职业去专业化的担忧。

Method: 基于先前AI教育文献和系统性文献综述，构建了教师-AI协作的五层次概念框架：交易性、情境性、操作性、实践性和协同性协作。

Result: 提出了支持教师-AI协作所需的技术功能，并通过实证研究验证了框架的有效性，展示了教师与AI通过协商、建设性挑战和共同推理来增强彼此能力。

Conclusion: 未来愿景是从个体教师自主权转向教师与AI的协同决策，通过协商和共同推理实现双方能力的增强，并需要考虑超越教师-AI协作的社会技术因素，以实现教师与AI在教育中的伦理和实际协同。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly used in education, posing significant challenges for teachers adapting to these changes. GenAI offers unprecedented opportunities for accessibility, scalability and productivity in educational tasks. However, the automation of teaching tasks through GenAI raises concerns about reduced teacher agency, potential cognitive atrophy, and the broader deprofessionalisation of teaching. Drawing findings from prior literature on AI in Education, and refining through a recent systematic literature review, this chapter presents a conceptualisation of five levels of teacher-AI teaming: transactional, situational, operational, praxical and synergistic teaming. The framework aims to capture the nuanced dynamics of teacher-AI interactions, particularly with GenAI, that may lead to the replacement, complementarity, or augmentation of teachers' competences and professional practice. GenAI technological affordances required in supporting teaming, along with empirical studies, are discussed. Drawing on empirical observations, we outline a future vision that moves beyond individual teacher agency toward collaborative decision-making between teachers and AI, in which both agents engage in negotiation, constructive challenge, and co-reasoning that enhance each other's capabilities and enable outcomes neither could realise independently. Further discussion of socio-technical factors beyond teacher-AI teaming is also included to streamline the synergy of teachers and AI in education ethically and practically.

Method: 采用带薪工作学习职位，通过结构化同伴指导、基于项目的学习和沟通培训，让学生处理从基础数据分析到软件开发的复杂数据问题，同时学习FAIR数据原则和开放科学实践。

Result: 项目成功实施，UCLA等院校通过"DataSquad International"采用该模式，使用公开共享材料。

Conclusion: 结构化同伴指导能同时提升机构数据服务能力并为学生提供专业技能和信心，该模式具有可适应性。

Abstract: The DataSquad at Carleton College addresses a common problem at small liberal arts colleges: limited capacity for data services and few opportunities for students to gain practical experience with data and software development. Academic Technologist Paula Lackie designed the program as a work-study position that trains undergraduates through structured peer mentorship and real client projects. Students tackle data problems of increasing complexity-from basic data analysis to software development-while learning FAIR data principles and open science practices. The model's core components (peer mentorship structure, project-based learning, and communication training) make it adaptable to other institutions. UCLA and other colleges have adopted the model using openly shared materials through "DataSquad International." This paper describes the program's implementation at Carleton College and examines how structured peer mentorship can simultaneously improve institutional data services and provide students with professional skills and confidence.

Method: 通过分析AI开发者的安全措施、技术改进（对抗训练、数据筛选、监控系统）和机构框架（安全框架发布、治理框架建立）来评估风险管理进展。

Conclusion: 通用AI风险管理在技术和机构层面都取得了进展，但仍需持续关注和改进，特别是在高风险场景下的安全保障。

Abstract: This second update to the 2025 International AI Safety Report assesses new developments in general-purpose AI risk management over the past year. It examines how researchers, public institutions, and AI developers are approaching risk management for general-purpose AI. In recent months, for example, three leading AI developers applied enhanced safeguards to their new models, as their internal pre-deployment testing could not rule out the possibility that these models could be misused to help create biological weapons. Beyond specific precautionary measures, there have been a range of other advances in techniques for making AI models and systems more reliable and resistant to misuse. These include new approaches in adversarial training, data curation, and monitoring systems. In parallel, institutional frameworks that operationalise and formalise these technical capabilities are starting to emerge: the number of companies publishing Frontier AI Safety Frameworks more than doubled in 2025, and governments and international organisations have established a small number of governance frameworks for general-purpose AI, focusing largely on transparency and risk assessment.

TL;DR: 对Google上大屠杀受害者视觉呈现的审计研究发现，搜索引擎传播男性主导的受害者形象，强调暴行背景，可能掩盖性别特定的苦难并削弱共情潜力，且不同地理位置的呈现存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息检索系统在塑造社会现实表征方面日益重要，但面临伦理挑战，特别是审美偏见问题。现有研究多关注当前社会议题，而历史表征（尤其是敏感历史事件如大屠杀）中的审美偏见研究不足。

Method: 对Google上大屠杀受害者视觉呈现进行对比审计研究。

Result: Google倾向于传播男性主导的大屠杀受害者表征，强调暴行背景，可能使性别特定的苦难不可见并降低共情潜力；不同地理位置的呈现存在差异，表明搜索算法可能产生自己的受害者审美。

Conclusion: 搜索引擎算法可能产生特定的受害者审美表征，需要关注历史敏感主题表征中的伦理问题，特别是避免性别偏见和促进更全面的共情理解。

Abstract: Information retrieval systems, such as search engines, increasingly shape the representation of the past and present states of social reality. Despite their importance, these systems face challenges in dealing with the ethical aspects of representation due to various forms of bias, including aesthetic bias that perpetuates hegemonic patterns of representation. While most research on aesthetic bias has examined it in the context of current societal issues, it is also crucial for historical representation, particularly of sensitive subjects such as historical atrocities. To address this gap, we conduct a comparative audit of the visual representation of Holocaust victims on Google. We find that Google tends to propagate a male-dominated representation of Holocaust victims with an emphasis on atrocity context, risking rendering invisible gender-specific suffering and decreasing potential for nurturing empathy. We also observe a variation in representation across geographic locations, suggesting that search algorithms may produce their own aesthetic of victimhood.

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence now make it possible to simulate the dead through chatbots, voice clones, and video avatars trained on a person's digital traces. These "digital ghosts" are moving from fiction to commercial reality, reshaping how people mourn and remember. This paper offers a conceptual and ethical analysis of AI-mediated digital afterlives. We define what counts as a digital ghost, trace their rise across personal, commercial, and institutional contexts, and identify core ethical tensions around grief and well-being, truthfulness and deception, consent and posthumous privacy, dignity and misrepresentation, and the commercialization of mourning. To analyze these challenges, we propose a nine-dimensional taxonomy of digital afterlife technologies and, building on it, outline the features of an ethically acceptable digital ghost: premortem intent, mutual consent, transparent and limited data use, clear disclosure, restricted purposes and access, family or estate stewardship, and minimal behavioral agency. We argue for targeted regulation and professional guidelines to ensure that digital ghosts can aid remembrance without slipping into forms of deception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证在阿根廷长期工程项目中，学术人员罢工和通货膨胀是否作为双重压力源共同影响学生辍学行为。

Method: 使用包含1,343名学生的纵向面板数据，采用LinearDML估计器分析罢工暴露及其与入学时通胀的交互作用对辍学的滞后因果效应。

Result: 罢工滞后2学期与入学时通胀的交互作用对辍学有显著正向影响（估计值=0.0625，p=0.0033），而单独的罢工效应在控制其他因素后变得不显著。

Conclusion: 宏观冲击作为耦合压力源，通过课程摩擦和财务韧性机制共同影响学生辍学，而非孤立事件。

Abstract: This study provides a causal validation of the dual-stressor hypothesis in a long-cycle engineering programme in Argentina, testing whether academic staff strikes (proximal shocks) and inflation (distal shocks) jointly shape student dropout. Using a leak-aware longitudinal panel of 1,343 students and a manually implemented LinearDML estimator, we estimate lagged causal effects of strike exposure and its interaction with inflation at entry. The temporal profile is clear: only strikes occurring two semesters earlier have a significant impact on next-semester dropout in simple lagged logit models (ATE = 0.0323, p = 0.0173), while other lags are negligible. When we move to double machine learning and control flexibly for academic progression, curriculum friction and calendar effects, the main effect of strikes at lag 2 becomes small and statistically non-significant, but the interaction between strikes and inflation at entry remains positive and robust (estimate = 0.0625, p = 0.0033). A placebo model with a synthetic strike variable yields null effects, and a robustness audit (seed sensitivity, model comparisons, SHAP inspection) confirms the stability of the interaction across specifications. SHAP analysis also reveals that Strikes_Lag2 and Inflation_at_Entry jointly contribute strongly to predicted dropout risk. These findings align with the CAPIRE-MACRO agent-based simulations and support the view that macro shocks act as coupled stressors mediated by curriculum friction and financial resilience rather than isolated events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多计算教育项目依赖开放注册的课外活动形式，但成功往往取决于营销策略。然而，计算教育研究文献中关于如何有效营销这些项目的指导很少。

Method: 对太平洋西北地区中学生教育黑客马拉松的营销策略进行干预，包括减少对富裕家庭的推广、使用针对性学校沟通、在初始推广中强调费用支持，然后比较干预前后的出勤率和自我报告的人口统计数据。

Result: 结果显示边缘化和低收入社区学生的比例更高，总体出勤率没有减少。

Conclusion: 通过调整营销策略，可以在不减少总体参与的情况下显著提高计算教育项目中边缘化和低收入学生的代表性。

Abstract: Many studies have aimed to broaden participation in computing (BPC) through extracurricular educational initiatives. When these initiatives are structured as open-enrollment extracurricular programs, their success often depends on their marketing approach. However, there is little in the computing education research literature about how to conduct effective marketing for these initiatives. We describe the changes made to the marketing strategy of one such program, an educational hackathon for middle school and high school students in the Pacific Northwest. These included reducing promotion to affluent families, using targeted school-based communication, and emphasizing cost supports during initial promotion. We then compare attendance and self-reported demographics before and after the intervention. Results indicate a higher proportion of students from marginalized and low-income communities and no reduction in overall attendance.

Motivation: 行为定向营销通过追踪用户在线行为来展示个性化广告，仅靠数据保护法可能不足以保护隐私，需要从行为科学角度重新审视监管政策。

Method: 通过分析行为定向营销的机制和政策影响，结合行为科学见解，论证禁止某些行为的必要性。

Result: 研究发现仅依赖数据保护法执行不足以有效保护隐私，需要更严格的监管措施。

Conclusion: 如果某些行为定向实践对社会不利，政策制定者应考虑直接禁止这些实践，而不仅仅依赖事后执法。

Abstract: This chapter examines the policy implications of behavioural sciences insights for the regulation of privacy on the Internet, by focusing in particular on behavioural targeting. This marketing technique involves tracking people's online behaviour to use the collected information to show people individually targeted advertisements. Enforcing data protection law may not be enough to protect privacy in this area. I argue that, if society is better off when certain behavioural targeting practices do not happen, policymakers should consider banning them.

Abstract: Nowadays, social networks are becoming a popular way of analyzing tourist behavior, thanks to the digital traces left by travelers during their stays on these networks. The massive amount of data generated; by the propensity of tourists to share comments and photos during their trip; makes it possible to model their journeys and analyze their behavior. Predicting the next movement of tourists plays a key role in tourism marketing to understand demand and improve decision support. In this paper, we propose a method to understand and to learn tourists' movements based on social network data analysis to predict future movements. The method relies on a machine learning grammatical inference algorithm. A major contribution in this paper is to adapt the grammatical inference algorithm to the context of big data. Our method produces a hidden Markov model representing the movements of a group of tourists. The hidden Markov model is flexible and editable with new data. The capital city of France, Paris is selected to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology.

### [92] [When Should Neural Data Inform Welfare? A Critical Framework for Policy Uses of Neuroeconomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19548)
*Yiven,Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于模型的框架，分析神经数据在何种条件下可以合法地为政策福利判断提供信息，而不仅仅是描述行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经经济学承诺基于神经和计算证据来建立福利分析，同时政策和商业行为者越来越多地引用神经数据来为家长式监管、"基于大脑"的干预和新福利措施辩护。

Method: 开发了一个非实证的、基于模型的框架，将神经信号、计算决策模型和规范性福利标准三个层次联系起来。在行动者-批评者强化学习模型中，形式化了从神经活动到潜在价值和预测误差，再到福利主张的推理路径。

Result: 只有当神经-计算映射得到良好验证、决策模型识别出"真实"利益与情境依赖的错误、福利标准被明确指定和辩护时，神经证据才能约束福利判断。

Conclusion: 将大脑和人工智能体视为价值学习系统，同时表明内部奖励信号（无论是生物的还是人工的）都是计算量，没有明确的规范性模型不能被视为福利度量。

Abstract: Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, "brain-based" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies "true" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于部分信息分解(PID)的框架，通过将内部嵌入中的预测信息分解为独特、冗余和协同成分来量化模态贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于准确性的方法，将移除模态后的性能下降解释为其影响力，但这类结果驱动指标无法区分模态是固有信息性的还是仅通过与其他模态交互产生价值。

Method: 开发了基于迭代比例拟合程序(IPFP)的算法，计算层和数据集级别的贡献而无需重新训练，实现可扩展的仅推理分析。

Result: 提供了原则性的表示级多模态行为视图，比基于结果的指标提供更清晰和可解释的见解。

Conclusion: 该框架能够区分模态的固有信息价值与交互价值，为多模态模型贡献分析提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Quantifying modality contributions in multimodal models remains a challenge, as existing approaches conflate the notion of contribution itself. Prior work relies on accuracy-based approaches, interpreting performance drops after removing a modality as indicative of its influence. However, such outcome-driven metrics fail to distinguish whether a modality is inherently informative or whether its value arises only through interaction with other modalities. This distinction is particularly important in cross-attention architectures, where modalities influence each other's representations. In this work, we propose a framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that quantifies modality contributions by decomposing predictive information in internal embeddings into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. To enable scalable, inference-only analysis, we develop an algorithm based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) that computes layer and dataset-level contributions without retraining. This provides a principled, representation-level view of multimodal behavior, offering clearer and more interpretable insights than outcome-based metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrefixGPT是一个基于GPT的生成模型，能够从零开始直接生成优化的前缀加法器，通过二维坐标序列表示拓扑结构并使用合法性掩码确保设计有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于严格的设计规则和指数级大的设计空间，设计优化的前缀加法器具有挑战性，需要一种能够自动生成优化设计的方法。

Method: 使用仅解码器的Transformer架构，首先在随机合成的有效前缀加法器语料库上进行预训练以学习设计规则，然后通过微调在设计空间中导航以优化设计质量。

Result: 与现有工作相比，PrefixGPT不仅找到了一个新的最优设计，面积延迟乘积(ADP)提高了7.7%，而且表现出优越的探索质量，平均ADP降低了高达79.1%。

Conclusion: 这证明了GPT风格模型在掌握复杂硬件设计原理并应用于更高效设计优化方面的潜力。

Abstract: Prefix adders are widely used in compute-intensive applications for their high speed. However, designing optimized prefix adders is challenging due to strict design rules and an exponentially large design space. We introduce PrefixGPT, a generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that directly generates optimized prefix adders from scratch. Our approach represents an adder's topology as a two-dimensional coordinate sequence and applies a legality mask during generation, ensuring every design is valid by construction. PrefixGPT features a customized decoder-only Transformer architecture. The model is first pre-trained on a corpus of randomly synthesized valid prefix adders to learn design rules and then fine-tuned to navigate the design space for optimized design quality. Compared with existing works, PrefixGPT not only finds a new optimal design with a 7.7% improved area-delay product (ADP) but exhibits superior exploration quality, lowering the average ADP by up to 79.1%. This demonstrates the potential of GPT-style models to first master complex hardware design principles and then apply them for more efficient design optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WavefrontDiffusion是一种动态解码方法，通过从已确定位置向外扩展活动标记波前，在保持与基于块的方法相同计算成本的同时，实现更连贯和高效的文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流去噪策略（标准扩散和块扩散）存在局限性：标准扩散会过早结束序列，块扩散的固定结构会破坏语义连贯性。需要一种能跟随语义结构自然流动的自适应调度方法。

Method: 提出WavefrontDiffusion方法，动态扩展活动标记波前，从已确定位置向外传播，采用自适应调度策略。

Result: 在推理和代码生成的四个基准测试中达到最先进性能，产生具有更高语义保真度的输出。

Conclusion: 自适应调度对于实现更连贯和高效的生成具有重要价值，WavefrontDiffusion展示了这一优势。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have shown strong potential for text generation and are becoming a competitive alternative to autoregressive models. The denoising strategy plays an important role in determining the quality of their outputs. Mainstream denoising strategies include Standard Diffusion and BlockDiffusion. Standard Diffusion performs global denoising without restricting the update range, often finalizing incomplete context and causing premature end-of-sequence predictions. BlockDiffusion updates fixed-size blocks in a preset order, but its rigid structure can break apart coherent semantic units and disrupt reasoning. We present WavefrontDiffusion, a dynamic decoding approach that expands a wavefront of active tokens outward from finalized positions. This adaptive process follows the natural flow of semantic structure while keeping computational cost equal to block-based methods. Across four benchmarks in reasoning and code generation, WavefrontDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing outputs with higher semantic fidelity, showing the value of adaptive scheduling for more coherent and efficient generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了MoE-LLMs在任务特定使用下的可剪枝性，揭示了知识损失与恢复的权衡关系，并提出了防御策略来防止未经授权的模型压缩和微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构虽然具有可扩展性和效率优势，但其模块化结构引入了新的安全漏洞：攻击者可以通过剪枝专家并廉价微调剩余部分来绕过许可和安全约束，实现模型压缩或重新用途。

Method: 开发了专家归因框架来识别对特定任务最重要的专家子集，然后使用主动学习驱动的微调评估剪枝和重新对齐这些专家的性能权衡。

Result: 研究发现存在关键的知识损失-恢复权衡：虽然可以隔离某些专家来保持任务准确性，但如果没有针对性的重新对齐，会出现显著的性能下降。

Conclusion: 通过将专家剪枝定位为威胁向量和防御目标，这项工作突出了MoE模块化的双重用途性质，并为MoE-LLMs的安全专业化提供了第一个系统评估框架。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are increasingly adopted in large language models (LLMs) for their scalability and efficiency. However, their modular structure introduces a unique vulnerability: adversaries can attempt to compress or repurpose models by pruning experts and cheaply fine-tuning the remainder, effectively bypassing licensing and security constraints. In this paper, we systematically study the prunability of MoE-LLMs under task-specific usage. We first develop an expert attribution framework that identifies the subset of experts most responsible for a given task, then evaluate the performance trade-offs of pruning and re-aligning these experts using active learning-driven fine-tuning. Our findings reveal a critical knowledge loss--recovery trade-off: while certain experts can be isolated to retain task accuracy, significant degradation occurs without targeted re-alignment. Based on this analysis, we propose defense strategies that aim to make MoE models harder to compress and fine-tune without authorization, including entangled expert training and selective fine-tuning protocols that resist unauthorized adaptation. By positioning expert pruning as both a threat vector and a defense target, this work highlights the dual-use nature of MoE modularity and provides the first systematic evaluation framework for secure specialization of MoE-LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于特征工程和粒子群优化的XGBoost回归模型，用于解决RAG系统中检索质量对生成效果的影响问题，通过优化文档相关性来提升答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，检索增强生成技术广泛应用，但系统性能高度依赖检索模块质量。当检索结果与用户需求相关性低或包含噪声信息时，会导致生成内容失真。现有模型在处理表格特征方面存在性能瓶颈。

Method: 采用基于特征工程和粒子群优化的XGBoost机器学习回归模型，通过相关性分析识别关键特征，并与决策树、AdaBoost等模型进行对比实验。

Result: VMD PSO BiLSTM模型在所有评估指标上表现最优，MSE、RMSE、MAE和MAPE显著降低，R2值更高，表明其预测精度、稳定性和数据解释能力更突出。相关性分析显示文档相关性与答案质量正相关(0.66)。

Conclusion: 该成果为优化RAG系统检索质量和提升生成效果提供了有效路径，对促进相关技术的实施和应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of large language models, retrieval enhanced generation technology has been widely used due to its ability to integrate external knowledge to improve output accuracy. However, the performance of the system is highly dependent on the quality of the retrieval module. If the retrieval results have low relevance to user needs or contain noisy information, it will directly lead to distortion of the generated content. In response to the performance bottleneck of existing models in processing tabular features, this paper proposes an XGBoost machine learning regression model based on feature engineering and particle swarm optimization. Correlation analysis shows that answer_quality is positively correlated with doc_delevance by 0.66, indicating that document relevance has a significant positive effect on answer quality, and improving document relevance may enhance answer quality; The strong negative correlations between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity were -0.89 and -0.88, respectively, indicating a tradeoff between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity. In other words, as the former two increased, diversity significantly decreased. The experimental results comparing decision trees, AdaBoost, etc. show that the VMD PSO BiLSTM model is superior in all evaluation indicators, with significantly lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE compared to the comparison model. The R2 value is higher, indicating that its prediction accuracy, stability, and data interpretation ability are more outstanding. This achievement provides an effective path for optimizing the retrieval quality and improving the generation effect of RAG system, and has important value in promoting the implementation and application of related technologies.

Motivation: ICU中生命体征数据噪声大、波动快，实验室数据存在缺失值、测量延迟和设备偏差等问题，使得多变量时间序列预测极具挑战性。

Method: 采用滑动窗口均衡采样平衡生理状态，频率感知嵌入收缩稳定罕见类别表示，分层变量选择引导模型关注信息特征簇，影响对齐注意力校准增强生理突变时的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OmniTFT减少了对特定目标架构和复杂特征工程的依赖，实现了多异质临床目标的统一建模，具有跨机构泛化能力，在临床决策支持中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate multivariate time-series prediction of vital signs and laboratory results is crucial for early intervention and precision medicine in intensive care units (ICUs). However, vital signs are often noisy and exhibit rapid fluctuations, while laboratory tests suffer from missing values, measurement lags, and device-specific bias, making integrative forecasting highly challenging. To address these issues, we propose OmniTFT, a deep learning framework that jointly learns and forecasts high-frequency vital signs and sparsely sampled laboratory results based on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Specifically, OmniTFT implements four novel strategies to enhance performance: sliding window equalized sampling to balance physiological states, frequency-aware embedding shrinkage to stabilize rare-class representations, hierarchical variable selection to guide model attention toward informative feature clusters, and influence-aligned attention calibration to enhance robustness during abrupt physiological changes. By reducing the reliance on target-specific architectures and extensive feature engineering, OmniTFT enables unified modeling of multiple heterogeneous clinical targets while preserving cross-institutional generalizability. Across forecasting tasks, OmniTFT achieves substantial performance improvement for both vital signs and laboratory results on the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU datasets. Its attention patterns are interpretable and consistent with known pathophysiology, underscoring its potential utility for quantitative decision support in clinical care.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the utility of Random Forest (RF) proximities for various supervised machine learning tasks, including outlier detection, missing data imputation, and visualization. However, the utility of the RF proximities depends upon the success of the RF model, which itself is not the ideal model in all contexts. RF proximities have recently been extended to time series by means of the distance-based Proximity Forest (PF) model, among others, affording time series analysis with the benefits of RF proximities. In this work, we introduce the generalized PF model, thereby extending RF proximities to all contexts in which supervised distance-based machine learning can occur. Additionally, we introduce a variant of the PF model for regression tasks. We also introduce the notion of using the generalized PF model as a meta-learning framework, extending supervised imputation capability to any pre-trained classifier. We experimentally demonstrate the unique advantages of the generalized PF model compared with both the RF model and the $k$-nearest neighbors model.

Abstract: Driven by recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), a growing body of work demonstrates the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to generate human-like responses in market research and social science applications. Two primary approaches can be applied to improve the performance of LLMs: fine-tuning, which aligns LLM predictions more closely with human responses, and rectification, which corrects biases in LLM outputs. In this paper, we develop a framework that combines fine-tuning and rectification, and optimally allocates limited labeled samples across the two stages. Unlike the conventional objective that minimizes the mean squared prediction errors, we propose to minimize the variance of the prediction errors as the fine-tuning objective, which is optimal for the downstream rectification stage. Building on this insight, we leverage empirical scaling laws to develop a data-driven method for optimally splitting samples between the fine-tuning and rectification stages. Empirical analysis validates our framework, demonstrating improved estimation and inference performance compared to using either fine-tuning or rectification alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机森林分析受限于邻近矩阵的内存瓶颈，只能处理约6万个样本的数据集，限制了其在大规模数据分析中的应用。

Method: 采用四种解决方案：(1) QLORA压缩技术将GPU邻近矩阵内存从80GB降至6.4MB；(2) CPU TriBlock存储结合上三角存储和块稀疏阈值；(3) SM感知GPU批处理大小优化；(4) GPU加速3D MDS可视化。

Conclusion: RFX v1.0消除了邻近矩阵的内存瓶颈，使基于邻近的随机森林分析能够处理比以往大几个数量级的数据集，提供了开源的生产就绪分类实现。

Abstract: RFX (Random Forests X), where X stands for compression or quantization, presents a production-ready implementation of Breiman and Cutler's Random Forest classification methodology in Python. RFX v1.0 provides complete classification: out-of-bag error estimation, overall and local importance measures, proximity matrices with QLORA compression, case-wise analysis, and interactive visualization (rfviz)--all with CPU and GPU acceleration. Regression, unsupervised learning, CLIQUE importance, and RF-GAP proximity are planned for v2.0.
  This work introduces four solutions addressing the proximity matrix memory bottleneck limiting Random Forest analysis to ~60,000 samples: (1) QLORA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) compression for GPU proximity matrices, reducing memory from 80GB to 6.4MB for 100k samples (12,500x compression with INT8 quantization) while maintaining 99% geometric structure preservation, (2) CPU TriBlock proximity--combining upper-triangle storage with block-sparse thresholding--achieving 2.7x memory reduction with lossless quality, (3) SM-aware GPU batch sizing achieving 95% GPU utilization, and (4) GPU-accelerated 3D MDS visualization computing embeddings directly from low-rank factors using power iteration.
  Validation across four implementation modes (GPU/CPU x case-wise/non-case-wise) demonstrates correct implementation. GPU achieves 1.4x speedup over CPU for overall importance with 500+ trees. Proximity computation scales from 1,000 to 200,000+ samples (requiring GPU QLORA), with CPU TriBlock filling the gap for medium-scale datasets (10K-50K samples). RFX v1.0 eliminates the proximity memory bottleneck, enabling proximity-based Random Forest analysis on datasets orders of magnitude larger than previously feasible. Open-source production-ready classification following Breiman and Cutler's original methodology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLHF存在对齐三难困境：无法同时实现代表性、可扩展性和鲁棒性。理论分析表明，要实现全球规模的公平对齐需要超多项式复杂度，当前RLHF系统通过牺牲代表性来解决这一困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF实践中观察到的矛盾现象：安全性提升导致公平性下降，扩展到多样化群体计算不可行，鲁棒性增强放大多数偏见。

Method: 通过复杂性理论分析，结合统计学习理论和鲁棒优化，形式化对齐三难困境并证明其理论界限。

Result: 证明同时实现代表性（ε≤0.01）和鲁棒性（δ≤0.001）需要Ω(2^{d_context})操作，这是超多项式复杂度。当前RLHF仅收集10^3-10^4样本，而全球代表性需要10^7-10^8样本。

Conclusion: RLHF存在根本性权衡，需要通过战略性地放宽对齐要求来导航这些权衡，为改进对齐方法提供具体方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used for aligning large language models, yet practitioners face a persistent puzzle: improving safety often reduces fairness, scaling to diverse populations becomes computationally intractable, and making systems robust often amplifies majority biases. We formalize this tension as the Alignment Trilemma: no RLHF system can simultaneously achieve (i) epsilon-representativeness across diverse human values, (ii) polynomial tractability in sample and compute complexity, and (iii) delta-robustness against adversarial perturbations and distribution shift. Through a complexity-theoretic analysis integrating statistical learning theory and robust optimization, we prove that achieving both representativeness (epsilon <= 0.01) and robustness (delta <= 0.001) for global-scale populations requires Omega(2^{d_context}) operations, which is super-polynomial in the context dimensionality. We show that current RLHF implementations resolve this trilemma by sacrificing representativeness: they collect only 10^3--10^4 samples from homogeneous annotator pools while 10^7--10^8 samples are needed for true global representation. Our framework provides a unified explanation for documented RLHF pathologies including preference collapse, sycophancy, and systematic bias amplification. We conclude with concrete directions for navigating these fundamental trade-offs through strategic relaxations of alignment requirements.

Motivation: 现有CSI反馈模型难以适应用户移动性导致的动态环境变化，遇到新CSI分布需要重新训练，且返回历史环境时因灾难性遗忘导致性能下降。

Method: 使用GAN生成器作为记忆单元，在持续学习过程中保留过去环境的知识，确保在不同场景下保持高性能而不遗忘。

Result: 仿真结果表明该方法增强了DAE框架的泛化能力，同时保持低内存开销，并能与其他先进CSI反馈模型无缝集成。

Conclusion: 所提出的GAN基学习方法具有鲁棒性和适应性，有效解决了CSI反馈中的持续学习挑战。

Abstract: Deep autoencoder (DAE) frameworks have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. However, existing CSI feedback models struggle to adapt to dynamic environments caused by user mobility, requiring retraining when encountering new CSI distributions. Moreover, returning to previously encountered environments often leads to performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning involves enabling models to incorporate new information while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based learning approach for CSI feedback. By using a GAN generator as a memory unit, our method preserves knowledge from past environments and ensures consistently high performance across diverse scenarios without forgetting. Simulation results show that the proposed approach enhances the generalization capability of the DAE framework while maintaining low memory overhead. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated with other advanced CSI feedback models, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

Result: 在已建立的捷径学习基准测试中实现了最先进的分布外性能。

Conclusion: 通过使分类器对捷径信号功能不变，而不是学习鲁棒表示，提供了一种简单有效的捷径学习鲁棒性方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning shortcuts, spurious and easily learned correlations in training data that cause severe failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. A dominant line of work seeks robustness by learning a robust representation, often explicitly partitioning the latent space into core and spurious components; this approach can be complex, brittle, and difficult to scale. We take a different approach, instead of a robust representation, we learn a robust function. We present a simple and effective training method that renders the classifier functionally invariant to shortcut signals. Our method operates within a disentangled latent space, which is essential as it isolates spurious and core features into distinct dimensions. This separation enables the identification of candidate shortcut features by their strong correlation with the label, used as a proxy for semantic simplicity. The classifier is then desensitized to these features by injecting targeted, anisotropic latent noise during training. We analyze this as targeted Jacobian regularization, which forces the classifier to ignore spurious features and rely on more complex, core semantic signals. The result is state-of-the-art OOD performance on established shortcut learning benchmarks.

Result: 该模型在开放世界学习中优于现有方法，在持续学习方面表现强劲，四个迭代中最高平均准确率达82.54%，最低准确率为65.87%。

Conclusion: 该模型能够在开放和持续学习环境中有效扩展对数据的理解并随时间改进，为开放世界机器学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Open-world machine learning is an emerging technique in artificial intelligence, where conventional machine learning models often follow closed-world assumptions, which can hinder their ability to retain previously learned knowledge for future tasks. However, automated intelligence systems must learn about novel classes and previously known tasks. The proposed model offers novel learning classes in an open and continuous learning environment. It consists of two different but connected tasks. First, it discovers unknown classes in the data and creates novel classes; next, it learns how to perform class incrementally for each new class. Together, they enable continual learning, allowing the system to expand its understanding of the data and improve over time. The proposed model also outperformed existing approaches in open-world learning. Furthermore, it demonstrated strong performance in continuous learning, achieving a highest average accuracy of 82.54% over four iterations and a minimum accuracy of 65.87%.

*Dhruva Kashyap,Chaitanya Murti,Pranav K Nayak,Tanay Narshana,Chiranjib Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ModHiFi算法，无需训练数据或损失函数即可进行模型修改，包括剪枝和遗忘任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放权重模型通常不提供训练数据和损失函数，这使得模型修改（如剪枝、遗忘）受到限制。现有方法需要梯度或真实标签，在计算资源有限的情况下不可行。

Method: 通过理论证明全局重构误差被局部重构误差线性界定，提出使用组件子集的局部重构行为来量化其全局重要性（子集保真度指标）。在特征不相关设置下，通过子集保真度选择单个组件是最优的，据此提出ModHiFi算法。

Result: ModHiFi-P在ImageNet模型上比现有技术快11%，在语言模型上表现有竞争力；ModHiFi-U在CIFAR-10上无需微调即可实现完全遗忘，在Swin Transformers上表现有竞争力。

Conclusion: 证明了在无需梯度或损失函数的情况下，通过局部重构行为可以有效识别模型关键组件，为模型修改提供了新方法。

Abstract: Open weight models, which are ubiquitous, rarely provide access to their training data or loss function. This makes modifying such models for tasks such as pruning or unlearning constrained by this unavailability an active area of research. Existing techniques typically require gradients or ground-truth labels, rendering them infeasible in settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global reconstruction error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term Subset Fidelity. In the uncorrelated features setting, selecting individual components via their Subset Fidelity scores is optimal, which we use to propose ModHiFi, an algorithm for model modification that requires no training data or loss function access. ModHiFi-P, for structured pruning, achieves an 11% speedup over the current state of the art on ImageNet models and competitive performance on language models. ModHiFi-U, for classwise unlearning, achieves complete unlearning on CIFAR-10 without fine-tuning and demonstrates competitive performance on Swin Transformers.

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了神经模型和搜索算法的优势，提供高质量解和更好泛化能力，且不依赖特定神经模型

Abstract: Neural models have shown promise in solving NP-hard graph combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. Once trained, they offer fast inference and reasonably high-quality solutions for in-distribution testing instances, but they generally fall short in terms of absolute solution quality compared to classical search-based algorithms that are admittedly slower but offer optimality guarantee once search finishes.
  We propose a novel framework that combines the inference efficiency and exploratory power of neural models with the solution quality guarantee of search-based algorithms. In particular, we use parameterized algorithms (PAs) as the search component. PAs are dedicated to identifying easy instances of generally NP-hard problems, and allow for practically efficient search by exploiting structural simplicity (of the identified easy instances). Under our framework, we use parameterized analysis to identify the structurally hard parts of a CO instance. The neural model handles the hard parts by generating advisory signals based on its data-driven understanding. The PA-based search component then integrates the advisory signals to systematically and efficiently searches through the remaining structurally easy parts. Notably, our framework is agnostic to the choice of neural model and produces strictly better solutions than neural solvers alone.
  We examine our framework on multiple CO tasks. Empirical results show that it achieves superior solution quality, competitive with that of commercial solvers. Furthermore, by using the neural model only for exploratory advisory signals, our framework exhibits improved out-of-distribution generalization, addressing a key limitation of existing neural CO solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM需要大量计算资源，模型压缩对受限环境部署至关重要，但主流压缩技术（知识蒸馏、结构化剪枝、低比特量化）的组合顺序和交互影响尚不明确。

Method: 系统评估Qwen2.5 3B模型上单技术和组合技术的压缩效果，包括单技术、双技术和三技术序列，使用困惑度、G-Eval、清晰度、提示对齐和压缩比等指标。

Result: 量化提供最大独立压缩，剪枝引入中等质量下降。技术顺序显著影响最终质量：P-KD-Q序列表现最佳，实现3.68倍压缩比同时保持强指令跟随和语言理解能力。早期应用量化的流水线因不可逆信息损失导致严重性能下降。

Conclusion: 为在资源受限环境中部署LLM，设计有效、顺序感知的压缩流水线至关重要，P-KD-Q序列提供了最佳平衡方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources, making model compression essential for efficient deployment in constrained environments. Among the dominant compression techniques: knowledge distillation, structured pruning, and low-bit quantization, their individual effects are well studied, but their interactions and optimal sequencing remain unclear. This work systematically examines how these techniques perform both independently and in combination when applied to the Qwen2.5 3B model. We evaluate multiple compression pipelines, including single, and proposed three-technique sequences, using perplexity, G-Eval, clarity, prompt alignment, and compression ratio as metrics. Our experiments show that quantization provides the greatest standalone compression, while pruning introduces moderate quality degradation. Critically, the ordering of techniques significantly affects the final model quality: the sequence Pruning, Knowledge Distillation, Quantization (P-KD-Q) yields the best balance, achieving a 3.68x compression ratio while preserving strong instruction-following and language understanding capabilities. Conversely, pipelines applying quantization early suffer severe performance degradation due to irreversible information loss that impairs subsequent training. Overall, this study offers practical insight into designing effective, ordering-aware compression pipelines for deploying LLMs in resource-limited settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对双层优化的下界问题，在光滑非凸-强凸设置下，提出了新的困难实例，分别在确定性和随机一阶oracle模型下获得了非平凡的下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管双层优化的上界保证已被广泛研究，但由于双层结构的复杂性，下界方面的进展有限。本文旨在填补这一空白，为双层优化建立更严格的下界。

Method: 开发新的困难实例，在光滑非凸-强凸设置下，分别针对确定性和随机一阶oracle模型进行分析。

Result: 在确定性情况下，任何一阶零尊重算法至少需要Ω(κ^{3/2}ε^{-2})次oracle调用才能找到ε-精确的稳定点；在随机情况下，至少需要Ω(κ^{5/2}ε^{-4})次随机oracle调用。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了当前双层优化上下界之间的显著差距，表明即使是简化情况（如二次下层目标）也需要进一步研究以理解标准一阶oracle下双层优化的最优复杂度。

Abstract: Although upper bound guarantees for bilevel optimization have been widely studied, progress on lower bounds has been limited due to the complexity of the bilevel structure. In this work, we focus on the smooth nonconvex-strongly-convex setting and develop new hard instances that yield nontrivial lower bounds under deterministic and stochastic first-order oracle models. In the deterministic case, we prove that any first-order zero-respecting algorithm requires at least $Ω(κ^{3/2}ε^{-2})$ oracle calls to find an $ε$-accurate stationary point, improving the optimal lower bounds known for single-level nonconvex optimization and for nonconvex-strongly-convex min-max problems. In the stochastic case, we show that at least $Ω(κ^{5/2}ε^{-4})$ stochastic oracle calls are necessary, again strengthening the best known bounds in related settings. Our results expose substantial gaps between current upper and lower bounds for bilevel optimization and suggest that even simplified regimes, such as those with quadratic lower-level objectives, warrant further investigation toward understanding the optimal complexity of bilevel optimization under standard first-order oracles.

TL;DR: Xmodel-2.5是一个13亿参数的小型语言模型，作为"即插即用代理核心"设计，通过μP训练方法实现超参数从2000万参数代理模型到完整模型的直接迁移，并在训练后期从AdamW切换到Muon优化器提升了推理性能。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具备强大的推理和工具使用能力，但其计算需求使其不适用于边缘或成本敏感的应用场景。

Method: 采用最大更新参数化(μP)训练方法，使用1.4T token的Warmup-Stable-Decay课程学习策略，并在衰减阶段从AdamW切换到Muon优化器，同时使用FP8混合精度训练。

Result: 在衰减阶段从AdamW切换到Muon优化器后，13个任务的推理平均性能提升了4.58%，同时保持所有其他超参数不变。

Conclusion: 早期使用AdamW的稳定性可以与后期Muon的锐化能力相结合，以获得更好的下游性能，为边缘部署提供了高效的模型解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models deliver strong reasoning and tool-use skills, yet their computational demands make them impractical for edge or cost-sensitive deployments. We present \textbf{Xmodel-2.5}, a 1.3-billion-parameter small language model designed as a \emph{drop-in agent core}. Training with maximal-update parameterization ($μ$P) allows hyper-parameters tuned on a 20M-parameter proxy to transfer directly to the full model, even under the parameter-tied \emph{tie-word-embedding} architecture. A 1.4T-token Warmup--Stable--Decay curriculum is used, and we further show that \textbf{switching from AdamW to Muon during the decay phase} improves the 13-task reasoning average by 4.58\,\% while keeping every other hyper-parameter fixed, verifying that early AdamW stability can be paired with late Muon sharpening for better downstream performance.

Motivation: 为广泛使用的扩散模型重加权损失函数提供理论依据，改进标准证据下界，提升模型性能。

Method: 构建时间相关的变分下界级联，结合这些下界产生重加权目标，适用于连续高斯扩散和掩码扩散模型。

Result: 在掩码扩散模型中展示了显著改进，像素空间图像建模质量接近连续扩散模型，并为掩码图像模型的简单加权方案提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: 提出的理论框架为扩散模型重加权损失提供了坚实的理论基础，在掩码扩散中实现了性能提升，验证了现有加权方案的有效性。

Abstract: We derive a new theoretical interpretation of the reweighted losses that are widely used for training diffusion models. Our method is based on constructing a cascade of time-dependent variational lower bounds on the data log-likelihood, that provably improves upon the standard evidence lower bound and results in reduced data-model KL-divergences. Combining such bounds gives rise to reweighted objectives that can be applied to any generative diffusion model including both continuous Gaussian diffusion and masked (discrete) diffusion models. Then, we showcase this framework in masked diffusion and report significant improvements over previous training losses in pixel-space image modeling, approaching sample quality comparable to continuous diffusion models. Our results also provide a theoretical justification for the simple weighting scheme widely used in masked image models.

TL;DR: SX-GeoTree是一种自解释地理空间回归树，通过结合空间残差控制和解释鲁棒性优化，在保持预测准确性的同时提升空间依赖性和解释稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策树在表格预测中存在两个主要问题：(i) 难以捕捉空间依赖性，(ii) 无法产生局部稳定的解释。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出SX-GeoTree方法，在递归分裂过程中集成三个耦合目标：不纯度减少(MSE)、空间残差控制(全局Moran's I)以及通过模块化最大化实现的解释鲁棒性。将局部Lipschitz连续性重新构造为网络社区保持问题。

Result: 在两个任务上的实验表明，SX-GeoTree在保持竞争性预测准确性的同时，改善了残差空间均匀性，并将归因共识提高了一倍(模块化度：福建0.19 vs 0.09；西雅图0.10 vs 0.05)。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了如何将空间相似性嵌入可解释模型中，推进可信地理空间机器学习，并为领域感知可解释性提供了可转移模板。

Abstract: Decision trees remain central for tabular prediction but struggle with (i) capturing spatial dependence and (ii) producing locally stable (robust) explanations. We present SX-GeoTree, a self-explaining geospatial regression tree that integrates three coupled objectives during recursive splitting: impurity reduction (MSE), spatial residual control (global Moran's I), and explanation robustness via modularity maximization on a consensus similarity network formed from (a) geographically weighted regression (GWR) coefficient distances (stimulus-response similarity) and (b) SHAP attribution distances (explanatory similarity). We recast local Lipschitz continuity of feature attributions as a network community preservation problem, enabling scalable enforcement of spatially coherent explanations without per-sample neighborhood searches. Experiments on two exemplar tasks (county-level GDP in Fujian, n=83; point-wise housing prices in Seattle, n=21,613) show SX-GeoTree maintains competitive predictive accuracy (within 0.01 $R^{2}$ of decision trees) while improving residual spatial evenness and doubling attribution consensus (modularity: Fujian 0.19 vs 0.09; Seattle 0.10 vs 0.05). Ablation confirms Moran's I and modularity terms are complementary; removing either degrades both spatial residual structure and explanation stability. The framework demonstrates how spatial similarity - extended beyond geometric proximity through GWR-derived local relationships - can be embedded in interpretable models, advancing trustworthy geospatial machine learning and offering a transferable template for domain-aware explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制在自然语言处理中表现出色，但在时间序列预测中尚未达到预期效果，需要探索更好的网络结构来提升预测性能。

Method: 提出PeriodNet，包含周期注意力和稀疏周期注意力机制分析相邻周期，引入迭代分组机制减少跨变量冗余，重新设计Transformer架构并添加周期扩散器进行多周期预测。

Result: 在8个数据集上的实验表明，PeriodNet在单变量和多变量时间序列预测中均优于6个最先进模型，特别是在720长度序列预测中相对改进达22%。

Conclusion: PeriodNet通过新颖的周期注意力机制和架构设计，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能，证明了其在处理时间序列数据方面的有效性。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has demonstrated remarkable potential in sequence modeling, exemplified by its successful application in natural language processing with models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Despite these advancements, its utilization in time series forecasting (TSF) has yet to meet expectations. Exploring a better network structure for attention in TSF holds immense significance across various domains. In this paper, we present PeriodNet with a brand new structure to forecast univariate and multivariate time series. PeriodNet incorporates period attention and sparse period attention mechanism for analyzing adjacent periods. It enhances the mining of local characteristics, periodic patterns, and global dependencies. For efficient cross-variable modeling, we introduce an iterative grouping mechanism which can directly reduce the cross-variable redundancy. To fully leverage the extracted features on the encoder side, we redesign the entire architecture of the vanilla Transformer and propose a period diffuser for precise multi-period prediction. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on eight datasets, we demonstrate that PeriodNet outperforms six state-of-the-art models in both univariate and multivariate TSF scenarios in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error. In particular, PeriodNet achieves a relative improvement of 22% when forecasting time series with a length of 720, in comparison to other models based on the conventional encoder-decoder Transformer architecture.

*Wenzhang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于配对多轮运行、偏差校正加速自助法置信区间和符号翻转置换测试的保守评估协议，用于判断小幅度性能提升（1-2%）是否具有统计显著性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习论文中报告的1-2个百分点性能提升往往缺乏不确定性估计和显著性检验，无法区分真实算法改进与随机噪声。

Method: 采用配对多轮运行、BCa自助法置信区间和基于每轮差异的符号翻转置换测试，构建保守的评估协议。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-10N和AG News数据集上的实验表明，单次运行和未配对的t检验经常错误地认为0.6-2.0个百分点的提升具有显著性，而提出的协议在仅使用3次运行时从未声明这些提升具有显著性。

Conclusion: 在有限计算预算下，这种保守的评估方法对于小幅度性能提升是更安全的选择，可以避免过度声称。

Abstract: Recent machine learning papers often report 1-2 percentage point improvements from a single run on a benchmark. These gains are highly sensitive to random seeds, data ordering, and implementation details, yet are rarely accompanied by uncertainty estimates or significance tests. It is therefore unclear when a reported +1-2% reflects a real algorithmic advance versus noise.
  We revisit this problem under realistic compute budgets, where only a few runs are affordable. We propose a simple, PC-friendly evaluation protocol based on paired multi-seed runs, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals, and a sign-flip permutation test on per-seed deltas. The protocol is intentionally conservative and is meant as a guardrail against over-claiming.
  We instantiate it on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10N, and AG News using synthetic no-improvement, small-gain, and medium-gain scenarios. Single runs and unpaired t-tests often suggest significant gains for 0.6-2.0 point improvements, especially on text. With only three seeds, our paired protocol never declares significance in these settings. We argue that such conservative evaluation is a safer default for small gains under tight budgets.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗环境中存在隐私风险，特别是训练数据记忆问题，需要解决不完善或隐私敏感的患者信息保护需求，同时满足监管合规和伦理标准。

Method: 采用分层双策略框架，结合几何约束梯度更新选择性调节目标参数，以及概念感知的token级干预，通过统一的四级医学概念层次区分保留关键token和遗忘目标token。

Result: 在MedMCQA（外科）和MHQA（焦虑、抑郁、创伤）数据集上的评估显示，达到82.7%遗忘率和88.5%知识保留率，同时保持强大的隐私保证。

Conclusion: 该框架在临床研究中满足了监管合规、可审计性和伦理标准的关键需求，为医疗领域的大语言模型隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance but pose substantial privacy risks due to training data memorization, particularly within healthcare contexts involving imperfect or privacy-sensitive patient information. We present a hierarchical dual-strategy framework for selective knowledge unlearning that precisely removes specialized knowledge while preserving fundamental medical competencies. Our approach synergistically integrates geometric-constrained gradient updates to selectively modulate target parameters with concept-aware token-level interventions that distinguish between preservation-critical and unlearning-targeted tokens via a unified four-level medical concept hierarchy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MedMCQA (surgical) and MHQA (anxiety, depression, trauma) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving an 82.7% forgetting rate and 88.5% knowledge preservation. Notably, our framework maintains robust privacy guarantees while requiring modification of only 0.1% of parameters, addressing critical needs for regulatory compliance, auditability, and ethical standards in clinical research.

TL;DR: TVM是一种广义的流匹配方法，支持高保真的一步和少步生成建模，通过建模任意两个扩散时间步之间的转换并在终端时间进行正则化，在ImageNet上实现了最先进的少步生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型需要多步推理才能达到高质量生成，而一步/少步生成模型往往性能较差。TVM旨在实现高质量的一步和少步生成，同时保持训练稳定性。

Method: 提出终端速度匹配(TVM)，建模任意扩散时间步之间的转换，在终端时间而非初始时间进行正则化。针对扩散变换器缺乏Lipschitz连续性的问题，引入最小架构修改实现稳定训练，并开发支持Jacobian-向量乘积反向传播的融合注意力核。

Result: 在ImageNet-256x256上，TVM单步生成达到3.29 FID，4步生成达到1.99 FID；在ImageNet-512x512上，单步生成达到4.32 FID，4步生成达到2.94 FID，实现了从零开始训练的一步/少步模型的最先进性能。

Conclusion: TVM通过终端时间正则化和架构优化，成功实现了高质量的一步和少步生成建模，为快速推理的扩散模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Terminal Velocity Matching (TVM), a generalization of flow matching that enables high-fidelity one- and few-step generative modeling. TVM models the transition between any two diffusion timesteps and regularizes its behavior at its terminal time rather than at the initial time. We prove that TVM provides an upper bound on the $2$-Wasserstein distance between data and model distributions when the model is Lipschitz continuous. However, since Diffusion Transformers lack this property, we introduce minimal architectural changes that achieve stable, single-stage training. To make TVM efficient in practice, we develop a fused attention kernel that supports backward passes on Jacobian-Vector Products, which scale well with transformer architectures. On ImageNet-256x256, TVM achieves 3.29 FID with a single function evaluation (NFE) and 1.99 FID with 4 NFEs. It similarly achieves 4.32 1-NFE FID and 2.94 4-NFE FID on ImageNet-512x512, representing state-of-the-art performance for one/few-step models from scratch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前取证检测器在跨越不同架构边界（如从GAN到扩散模型）时缺乏跨生成器泛化能力，这源于不同架构产生的伪影存在根本性差异。

Method: 提出TriDetect半监督方法，通过Sinkhorn-Knopp算法进行平衡聚类分配和跨视图一致性机制，学习基础架构差异。

Result: 在两个标准基准和三个真实数据集上评估，与13个基线方法相比，证明了其对未见生成器的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TriDetect通过发现潜在架构模式有效解决了跨生成器检测的泛化问题，特别是在跨越不同架构边界时表现出色。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generators (e.g., StyleGAN, Midjourney, DALL-E) has produced highly realistic synthetic images, posing significant challenges to digital media authenticity. These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{Tri}archy \textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the "fake" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts. We evaluate our approach on two standard benchmarks and three in-the-wild datasets against 13 baselines to demonstrate its generalization capability to unseen generators.

Abstract: We present a case study for the calibration of Low-cost air-quality (LCAQ) CO sensors from one of the largest multi-site-multi-season-multi-sensor-multi-pollutant mobile air-quality monitoring network deployments in India. LCAQ sensors have been shown to play a critical role in the establishment of dense, expansive air-quality monitoring networks and combating elevated pollution levels. The calibration of LCAQ sensors against regulatory-grade monitors is an expensive, laborious and time-consuming process, especially when a large number of sensors are to be deployed in a geographically diverse layout. In this work, we present the RESPIRE technique to calibrate LCAQ sensors to detect ambient CO (Carbon Monoxide) levels. RESPIRE offers specific advantages over baseline calibration methods popular in literature, such as improved prediction in cross-site, cross-season, and cross-sensor settings. RESPIRE offers a training algorithm that is provably resistant to outliers and an explainable model with the ability to flag instances of model overfitting. Empirical results are presented based on data collected during an extensive deployment spanning four sites, two seasons and six sensor packages.

TL;DR: Cisco Time Series Model是一个单变量零样本预测模型，通过多分辨率输入架构创新，在超过300B数据点上训练，在可观测性数据集上表现优异，同时在通用预测基准上保持相似性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够处理多分辨率输入的时间序列基础模型，特别针对可观测性领域进行优化，同时保持通用预测能力。

Abstract: We introduce the Cisco Time Series Model, a univariate zero-shot forecaster. This time series foundation model is the result of a general architectural innovation to a time series model enabling it to accept multiresolution input, applied to a popular decoder-only time series model (TimesFM). The resulting multiresolution decoder-only model is trained on over 300B unique data points, with more than half coming from the observability domain. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the resulting model achieves superior performance on observability datasets while retaining very similar performance on a standard general-purpose forecasting benchmark (GIFT-Eval), and suggest that the multiresolution structure enables the model to make more accurate predictions on long context input.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一种称为症状特征生成器的替代表示方法，将DSM-5的叙述形式与二进制矩阵表示联系起来，能够自动生成有效的症状组合，解决了复杂认知障碍诊断中症状组合过多的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的简化机器可操作表示方法不适合处理最复杂的认知障碍病例，而生成或应用完整的二进制矩阵进行相似性计算由于症状组合数量庞大而不可行。

Method: 使用严格预定义的列表、集合和数字格式，开发症状特征生成器表示方法，将复杂诊断路径表示为生成器列表，并通过目标生成器操作开发特征缩减方法。

Result: 表示几种精神病性障碍并生成所有症状组合显示，复杂障碍的矩阵表示变得过于庞大而无法管理，MPCS算法无法处理这种规模的矩阵。

Conclusion: 生成器方法为二进制矩阵提供了可读、适应性强且全面的替代方案，使得能够通过条件生成器计算复杂障碍之间的特定MPCS值。

Abstract: Mental health disorders, particularly cognitive disorders defined by deficits in cognitive abilities, are described in detail in the DSM-5, which includes definitions and examples of signs and symptoms. A simplified, machine-actionable representation was developed to assess the similarity and separability of these disorders, but it is not suited for the most complex cases. Generating or applying a full binary matrix for similarity calculations is infeasible due to the vast number of symptom combinations. This research develops an alternative representation that links the narrative form of the DSM-5 with the binary matrix representation and enables automated generation of valid symptom combinations. Using a strict pre-defined format of lists, sets, and numbers with slight variations, complex diagnostic pathways involving numerous symptom combinations can be represented. This format, called the symptom profile generator (or simply generator), provides a readable, adaptable, and comprehensive alternative to a binary matrix while enabling easy generation of symptom combinations (profiles). Cognitive disorders, which typically involve multiple diagnostic criteria with several symptoms, can thus be expressed as lists of generators. Representing several psychotic disorders in generator form and generating all symptom combinations showed that matrix representations of complex disorders become too large to manage. The MPCS (maximum pairwise cosine similarity) algorithm cannot handle matrices of this size, prompting the development of a profile reduction method using targeted generator manipulation to find specific MPCS values between disorders. The generators allow easier creation of binary representations for large matrices and make it possible to calculate specific MPCS cases between complex disorders through conditional generators.

Abstract: Traditional vision-based material perception methods often experience substantial performance degradation under visually impaired conditions, thereby motivating the shift toward non-visual multimodal material perception. Despite this, existing approaches frequently perform naive fusion of multimodal inputs, overlooking key challenges such as modality-specific noise, missing modalities common in real-world scenarios, and the dynamically varying importance of each modality depending on the task. These limitations lead to suboptimal performance across several benchmark tasks. In this paper, we propose a robust multimodal fusion framework, TouchFormer. Specifically, we employ a Modality-Adaptive Gating (MAG) mechanism and intra- and inter-modality attention mechanisms to adaptively integrate cross-modal features, enhancing model robustness. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Instance Embedding Regularization(CER) strategy, which significantly improves classification accuracy in fine-grained subcategory material recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing non-visual methods, the proposed TouchFormer framework achieves classification accuracy improvements of 2.48% and 6.83% on SSMC and USMC tasks, respectively. Furthermore, real-world robotic experiments validate TouchFormer's effectiveness in enabling robots to better perceive and interpret their environment, paving the way for its deployment in safety-critical applications such as emergency response and industrial automation. The code and datasets will be open-source, and the videos are available in the supplementary materials.

*Peng Zhao,Yu-Hu Yan,Hang Yu,Zhi-Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了UniGrad系列算法，实现了同时具备通用性和自适应性的在线学习，能够适应梯度变化并获得最优后悔界


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用在线学习方法缺乏问题相关的自适应性，特别是无法根据梯度变化V_T来调整后悔界，而梯度变化在随机优化和博弈快速收敛中至关重要

Method: 设计了UniGrad.Correct和UniGrad.Bregman两种实现，都使用元算法配合O(log T)个基础学习器；还提出了计算效率更高的UniGrad++，通过代理优化将每轮梯度查询减少到1次

Result: UniGrad.Correct对强凸函数获得O(log V_T)后悔，对指数凹函数获得O(d log V_T)后悔，对凸函数获得O(√(V_T log V_T))后悔并保持RVU性质；UniGrad.Bregman对凸函数获得最优的O(√V_T)后悔

Conclusion: UniGrad系列算法首次实现了同时具备通用性和自适应性的在线学习，能够根据梯度变化自适应调整后悔界，且UniGrad++在保持性能的同时显著提高了计算效率

Abstract: Universal online learning aims to achieve optimal regret guarantees without requiring prior knowledge of the curvature of online functions. Existing methods have established minimax-optimal regret bounds for universal online learning, where a single algorithm can simultaneously attain $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for convex functions, $\mathcal{O}(d \log T)$ for exp-concave functions, and $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ for strongly convex functions, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $d$ is the dimension of the feasible domain. However, these methods still lack problem-dependent adaptivity. In particular, no universal method provides regret bounds that scale with the gradient variation $V_T$, a key quantity that plays a crucial role in applications such as stochastic optimization and fast-rate convergence in games. In this work, we introduce UniGrad, a novel approach that achieves both universality and adaptivity, with two distinct realizations: UniGrad.Correct and UniGrad.Bregman. Both methods achieve universal regret guarantees that adapt to gradient variation, simultaneously attaining $\mathcal{O}(\log V_T)$ regret for strongly convex functions and $\mathcal{O}(d \log V_T)$ regret for exp-concave functions. For convex functions, the regret bounds differ: UniGrad.Correct achieves an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{V_T \log V_T})$ bound while preserving the RVU property that is crucial for fast convergence in online games, whereas UniGrad.Bregman achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{V_T})$ regret bound through a novel design. Both methods employ a meta algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ base learners, which naturally requires $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ gradient queries per round. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce UniGrad++, which retains the regret while reducing the gradient query to just $1$ per round via surrogate optimization. We further provide various implications.

*Bing Liu,Boao Kong,Limin Lu,Kun Yuan,Chengcheng Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过加权希尔伯特空间框架分析去中心化学习中两种权重处理策略的收敛差异，发现行随机矩阵设计在某些条件下即使谱隙更小也能收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化学习中处理异构节点权重的两种自然策略（嵌入本地损失vs使用行随机矩阵）在欧几里得空间分析中显示相同的期望下降方向，但实际收敛行为差异的本质原因尚不清楚。

Method: 构建加权希尔伯特空间框架L²(λ;ℝᵈ)，分析两种策略在该几何结构下的收敛率，使用Rayleigh商和Loewner序特征值比较方法。

Result: 在希尔伯特空间几何中，行随机矩阵成为自伴算子而双随机矩阵不是，产生额外的惩罚项放大共识误差从而减慢收敛。行随机设计在某些条件下即使谱隙更小也能收敛更快。

Conclusion: 收敛差异不仅来自谱隙，还来自惩罚项。通过特征值比较获得拓扑条件保证行随机设计的优势，为实际拓扑设计提供指导。

Abstract: Decentralized learning often involves a weighted global loss with heterogeneous node weights $λ$. We revisit two natural strategies for incorporating these weights: (i) embedding them into the local losses to retain a uniform weight (and thus a doubly stochastic matrix), and (ii) keeping the original losses while employing a $λ$-induced row-stochastic matrix. Although prior work shows that both strategies yield the same expected descent direction for the global loss, it remains unclear whether the Euclidean-space guarantees are tight and what fundamentally differentiates their behaviors. To clarify this, we develop a weighted Hilbert-space framework $L^2(λ;\mathbb{R}^d)$ and obtain convergence rates that are strictly tighter than those from Euclidean analysis. In this geometry, the row-stochastic matrix becomes self-adjoint whereas the doubly stochastic one does not, creating additional penalty terms that amplify consensus error, thereby slowing convergence. Consequently, the difference in convergence arises not only from spectral gaps but also from these penalty terms. We then derive sufficient conditions under which the row-stochastic design converges faster even with a smaller spectral gap. Finally, by using a Rayleigh-quotient and Loewner-order eigenvalue comparison, we further obtain topology conditions that guarantee this advantage and yield practical topology-design guidelines.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-turn conversational attacks, which leverage psychological principles like Foot-in-the-Door (FITD), where a small initial request paves the way for a more significant one, to bypass safety alignments, pose a persistent threat to Large Language Models (LLMs). Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了主动学习市场来购买标签，通过优化问题形式化市场清算，整合预算约束和改进阈值，在房地产定价和能源预测等实际应用中验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在模型拟合和预测分析应用中，分析师需要获取额外数据来改进模型性能，现有方法主要关注购买特征和样本，而标签购买的研究相对较少。

Method: 采用单买家-多卖家设置，提出两种主动学习策略（基于方差和基于查询委员会），配合不同的定价机制，并与随机采样基准进行比较。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法具有鲁棒性，相比传统方法能用更少的标签获得更优的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境中的数据采集优化提供了一个易于实现的实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce and analyse active learning markets as a way to purchase labels, in situations where analysts aim to acquire additional data to improve model fitting, or to better train models for predictive analytics applications. This comes in contrast to the many proposals that already exist to purchase features and examples. By originally formalising the market clearing as an optimisation problem, we integrate budget constraints and improvement thresholds into the label acquisition process. We focus on a single-buyer-multiple-seller setup and propose the use of two active learning strategies (variance based and query-by-committee based), paired with distinct pricing mechanisms. They are compared to a benchmark random sampling approach. The proposed strategies are validated on real-world datasets from two critical application domains: real estate pricing and energy forecasting. Results demonstrate the robustness of our approach, consistently achieving superior performance with fewer labels acquired compared to conventional methods. Our proposal comprises an easy-to-implement practical solution for optimising data acquisition in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Satellite constellations in low-Earth orbit are now widespread, enabling positioning, Earth imaging, and communications. In this paper we address the solution of learning problems using these satellite constellations. In particular, we focus on a federated approach, where satellites collect and locally process data, with the ground station aggregating local models. We focus on designing a novel, communication-efficient algorithm that still yields accurate trained models. To this end, we employ several mechanisms to reduce the number of communications with the ground station (local training) and their size (compression). We then propose an error feedback mechanism that enhances accuracy, which yields, as a byproduct, an algorithm-agnostic error feedback scheme that can be more broadly applied. We analyze the convergence of the resulting algorithm, and compare it with the state of the art through simulations in a realistic space scenario, showcasing superior performance.

Conclusion: 该框架能够准确建模非平稳场不连续性，高效构建物理一致的无线电地图，为室内定位提供可靠的环境感知表示。

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) serve as environment-aware electromagnetic (EM) representations that connect scenario geometry and material properties to the spatial distribution of signal strength, enabling localization without costly in-situ measurements. However, constructing high-fidelity indoor RMs remains challenging due to the prohibitive latency of EM solvers and the limitations of learning-based methods, which often rely on sparse measurements or assumptions of homogeneous material, which are misaligned with the heterogeneous and multipath-rich nature of indoor environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose iRadioDiff, a sampling-free diffusion-based framework for indoor RM construction. iRadioDiff is conditioned on access point (AP) positions, and physics-informed prompt encoded by material reflection and transmission coefficients. It further incorporates multipath-critical priors, including diffraction points, strong transmission boundaries, and line-of-sight (LoS) contours, to guide the generative process via conditional channels and boundary-weighted objectives. This design enables accurate modeling of nonstationary field discontinuities and efficient construction of physically consistent RMs. Experiments demonstrate that iRadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor RM construction and received signal strength based indoor localization, which offers effective generalization across layouts and material configurations.

Motivation: 现有在线稀疏流特征选择方法在特征评估方面存在显著局限性，导致性能下降，需要改进特征选择效果。

Method: 使用潜在因子分析模型进行缺失值填补，并通过差分进化算法评估特征重要性。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上的实验表明，ODESFS能够选择最优特征子集并获得更高的准确率，优于现有的OSFS和OS2FS方法。

Conclusion: ODESFS方法通过结合缺失值填补和差分进化特征评估，显著提升了在线流特征选择的性能。

Abstract: The processing of high-dimensional streaming data commonly utilizes online streaming feature selection (OSFS) techniques. However, practical implementations often face challenges with data incompleteness due to equipment failures and technical constraints. Online Sparse Streaming Feature Selection (OS2FS) tackles this issue through latent factor analysis-based missing data imputation. Despite this advancement, existing OS2FS approaches exhibit substantial limitations in feature evaluation, resulting in performance deterioration. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a novel Online Differential Evolution for Sparse Feature Selection (ODESFS) in data streams, incorporating two key innovations: (1) missing value imputation using a latent factor analysis model, and (2) feature importance evaluation through differential evolution. Comprehensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that ODESFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art OSFS and OS2FS methods by selecting optimal feature subsets and achieving superior accuracy.

Conclusion: OTMF通过最优传输理论解决了模型融合中的分布偏移问题，为模型合并提供了实用和理论价值的新方法。

Abstract: Merging models fine-tuned for different tasks into a single unified model has become an increasingly important direction for building versatile, efficient multi-task systems. Existing approaches predominantly rely on parameter interpolation in weight space, which we show introduces significant distribution shift in the feature space and undermines task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose OTMF (Optimal Transport-based Masked Fusion), a novel model merging framework rooted in optimal transport theory to address the distribution shift that arises from naive parameter interpolation. Instead of directly aggregating features or weights, OTMF aligns the semantic geometry of task-specific models by discovering common masks applied to task vectors through optimal transport plans. These masks selectively extract transferable and task-agnostic components while preserving the unique structural identities of each task. To ensure scalability in real-world settings, OTMF further supports a continual fusion paradigm that incrementally integrates each new task vector without revisiting previous ones, maintaining a bounded memory footprint and enabling efficient fusion across a growing number of tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple vision and language benchmarks, and results show that OTMF achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight the practical and theoretical value of our approach to model merging.

Abstract: Many consequential real-world systems, like wind fields and ocean currents, are dynamic and hard to model. Learning their governing dynamics remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) provides a simple, data-driven approximation, but practical use is limited by sparse/noisy observations from continuous fields, reliance on linear approximations, and the lack of principled uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, we introduce Stochastic NODE-DMD, a probabilistic extension of DMD that models continuous-time, nonlinear dynamics while remaining interpretable. Our approach enables continuous spatiotemporal reconstruction at arbitrary coordinates and quantifies predictive uncertainty. Across four benchmarks, a synthetic setting and three physics-based flows, it surpasses a baseline in reconstruction accuracy when trained from only 10% observation density. It further recovers the dynamical structure by aligning learned modes and continuous-time eigenvalues with ground truth. Finally, on datasets with multiple realizations, our method learns a calibrated distribution over latent dynamics that preserves ensemble variability rather than averaging across regimes.

Motivation: 语言模型反演（LMI）对用户隐私和系统安全构成威胁，现有方法效果有限且依赖大量数据。

Result: 在9个数据集上超越基线方法，平均BLEU分数提升4.77%，减少了对大型反演语料库的依赖。

Conclusion: 现有防御措施保护有限，需要更强的防御策略；提出的方法在反演攻击中表现出色。

Abstract: Language model inversion (LMI), i.e., recovering hidden prompts from outputs, emerges as a concrete threat to user privacy and system security. We recast LMI as reusing the LLM's own latent space and propose the Invariant Latent Space Hypothesis (ILSH): (1) diverse outputs from the same source prompt should preserve consistent semantics (source invariance), and (2) input<->output cyclic mappings should be self-consistent within a shared latent space (cyclic invariance). Accordingly, we present Inv^2A, which treats the LLM as an invariant decoder and learns only a lightweight inverse encoder that maps outputs to a denoised pseudo-representation. When multiple outputs are available, they are sparsely concatenated at the representation layer to increase information density. Training proceeds in two stages: contrastive alignment (source invariance) and supervised reinforcement (cyclic invariance). An optional training-free neighborhood search can refine local performance. Across 9 datasets covering user and system prompt scenarios, Inv^2A outperforms baselines by an average of 4.77% BLEU score while reducing dependence on large inverse corpora. Our analysis further shows that prevalent defenses provide limited protection, underscoring the need for stronger strategies.

Abstract: General-purpose control demands agents that act across many tasks and embodiments, yet research on reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control remains dominated by single-task or offline regimes, reinforcing a view that online RL does not scale. Inspired by the foundation model recipe (large-scale pretraining followed by light RL) we ask whether a single agent can be trained on hundreds of tasks with online interaction. To accelerate research in this direction, we introduce a new benchmark with 200 diverse tasks spanning many domains and embodiments, each with language instructions, demonstrations, and optionally image observations. We then present \emph{Newt}, a language-conditioned multitask world model that is first pretrained on demonstrations to acquire task-aware representations and action priors, and then jointly optimized with online interaction across all tasks. Experiments show that Newt yields better multitask performance and data-efficiency than a set of strong baselines, exhibits strong open-loop control, and enables rapid adaptation to unseen tasks. We release our environments, demonstrations, code for training and evaluation, as well as 200+ checkpoints.

TL;DR: 提出了Rashomon概念瓶颈模型框架，通过轻量级适配器模块和多样性正则化训练目标，学习多个准确但通过不同人类可理解概念进行推理的神经网络，揭示同等性能解决方案中的推理多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络存在Rashomon效应，即多个模型可以达到相同性能但依赖不同特征或推理模式。然而，在深度架构中发现这种多样性具有挑战性，因为连续参数空间包含无数数值不同但行为相似的近最优解。

Method: 结合轻量级适配器模块与多样性正则化训练目标，无需从头重新训练即可高效构建多样化的基于概念的深度模型集合。

Result: 生成的网络为相同预测提供根本不同的推理过程，揭示了在同等性能解决方案中概念依赖和决策制定的变化。

Conclusion: 该框架能够系统性地探索深度模型中数据驱动推理的多样性，为审计、比较和对齐同等准确解决方案提供了新机制。

Abstract: Modern neural networks rarely have a single way to be right. For many tasks, multiple models can achieve identical performance while relying on different features or reasoning patterns, a property known as the Rashomon Effect. However, uncovering this diversity in deep architectures is challenging as their continuous parameter spaces contain countless near-optimal solutions that are numerically distinct but often behaviorally similar. We introduce Rashomon Concept Bottleneck Models, a framework that learns multiple neural networks which are all accurate yet reason through distinct human-understandable concepts. By combining lightweight adapter modules with a diversity-regularized training objective, our method constructs a diverse set of deep concept-based models efficiently without retraining from scratch. The resulting networks provide fundamentally different reasoning processes for the same predictions, revealing how concept reliance and decision making vary across equally performing solutions. Our framework enables systematic exploration of data-driven reasoning diversity in deep models, offering a new mechanism for auditing, comparison, and alignment across equally accurate solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的时间序列预测面临挑战，因为时间模式在多个尺度上运作，从广泛上下文趋势到驱动关键决策的快速细粒度波动。现有神经网络模型难以表示这些交互动态，导致预测不稳定和下游应用可靠性降低。

Method: 采用预测-模糊-去噪框架，包含可学习高斯过程模块生成平滑相关扰动，鼓励预测主干捕获长程结构，同时专用细化模型恢复高分辨率时间细节。组件联合训练实现自然能力分工，避免各向同性腐蚀方法常见的人工痕迹。

Conclusion: 通过增强细粒度时间预测的可靠性和可解释性，该框架为能源、基础设施和其他时间关键领域中基于预测的决策支持系统贡献了更值得信赖的AI系统。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting remains difficult in real-world settings because temporal patterns operate at multiple scales, from broad contextual trends to fast, fine-grained fluctuations that drive critical decisions. Existing neural models often struggle to represent these interacting dynamics, leading to unstable predictions and reduced reliability in downstream applications. This work introduces a forecast-blur-denoise framework that improves temporal fidelity through structured noise modeling. The approach incorporates a learnable Gaussian Process module that generates smooth, correlated perturbations, encouraging the forecasting backbone to capture long-range structure while a dedicated refinement model restores high-resolution temporal detail. Training the components jointly enables natural competence division and avoids the artifacts commonly produced by isotropic corruption methods. Experiments across electricity, traffic, and solar datasets show consistent gains in multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The modular design also allows the blur-denoise layer to operate as a lightweight enhancement for pretrained models, supporting efficient adaptation in limited-data scenarios. By strengthening the reliability and interpretability of fine-scale temporal predictions, this framework contributes to more trustworthy AI systems used in forecasting-driven decision support across energy, infrastructure, and other time-critical domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域应用需求增长，但模型规模大限制了在资源受限环境中的部署，现有压缩方法要么跨领域泛化能力差，要么开销过高。

Method: 结合传播感知剪枝准则(Foresight Mask)和高效适配器更新算法(Partial Brain Surgeon)，集成到LoRA微调过程中，实现一步转换通用预训练模型为稀疏领域专家。

Result: 在医疗和法律任务中，在40%稀疏度下保持高达98%的密集模型性能，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 领域依赖的结构变化会降低通用剪枝掩码的有效性，需要针对每个领域采用自适应的领域感知剪枝策略。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has increased the demand for domain-specialized variants in areas such as law, healthcare, and finance. However, their large size remains a barrier to deployment in resource-constrained environments, and existing compression methods either generalize poorly across domains or incur high overhead. In this work, we propose \textbf{EfficientXpert}, a lightweight domain-pruning framework that combines a propagation-aware pruning criterion (Foresight Mask) with an efficient adapter-update algorithm (Partial Brain Surgeon). Integrated into the LoRA fine-tuning process, EfficientXpert enables a one-step transformation of general pretrained models into sparse, domain-adapted experts. Across health and legal tasks, it retains up to 98% of dense-model performance at 40% sparsity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis reveals substantial domain-dependent structural shifts that degrade the effectiveness of general pruning masks, underscoring the need for adaptive, domain-aware pruning strategies tailored to each domain.

*Craig Dickson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Prior work has shown that fine-tuning models on a narrow domain with misaligned data can lead to broad misalignment - a phenomenon termed "emergent misalignment" (Betley et al. 2025). While all tested models were susceptible to emergent misalignment, some models showed more resistance than others. Specifically the Qwen-2.5 family proved to be relatively resistant, while GPT-4o exhibited the strongest misalignment. In this paper we evaluate if current-generation open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to the Qwen-2.5 family and measure misalignment robustness over a range of model architectures and scales.
  We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters). Models fine-tuned on insecure code generation show a 0.68% misalignment rate (compared to 0.07% for base models), matching the lower end of prior open-model results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%.
  We identify a critical format-dependent vulnerability: requiring JSON output doubles misalignment rates compared to natural language prompts (0.96% vs 0.42%). This suggests that structural constraints may bypass safety training by reducing the model's 'degrees of freedom' to refuse. These findings confirm emergent misalignment as a reproducible phenomenon in modern open-weights models, with rates substantially lower than observed in proprietary systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据普遍存在，但标注成本高昂。现有的时间序列基础模型主要关注预测任务，缺乏无需微调、支持上下文学习的通用分类模型。

Method: 提出TiCT模型：1）新颖架构，包括可扩展的基于比特的标签编码和特殊输出注意力机制；2）合成预训练框架，结合Mixup启发的过程和数据增强来促进泛化和噪声不变性。

Result: 在UCR Archive上的广泛评估显示，TiCT仅使用上下文示例在推理时就能达到与最先进监督方法相竞争的性能，且无需更新任何模型权重。

Conclusion: TiCT证明了仅使用合成数据预训练的时间序列基础模型能够有效支持上下文学习分类，为时间序列分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The ubiquity of time series data creates a strong demand for general-purpose foundation models, yet developing them for classification remains a significant challenge, largely due to the high cost of labeled data. Foundation models capable of in-context learning (ICL) offer a powerful solution, adapting to new tasks with minimal examples and reducing the need for extensive retraining. However, prior work on large-scale time series models has predominantly focused on forecasting, leaving a critical gap for versatile, fine-tuning-free classification. To address this, we introduce TiCT (Time-series in-Context Transformer), a transformer-based model pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data to perform in-context classification. We make two primary technical contributions: 1) a novel architecture featuring a scalable bit-based label encoding and a special output attention mechanism to handle an arbitrary number of classes; and 2) a synthetic pre-training framework that combines a Mixup-inspired process with data augmentation to foster generalization and noise invariance. Extensive evaluations on the UCR Archive show that TiCT achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art supervised methods. Crucially, this is accomplished using only in-context examples at inference time, without updating a single model weight.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种更细粒度的视角，将Transformer中的注意力头和MLP层分解为正交奇异方向，揭示了单个组件内叠加的独立计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机制可解释性方法通常将注意力头和MLP层视为不可分割单元，忽视了它们内部可能学习到的功能子结构。

Method: 将Transformer组件分解为正交奇异方向，在标准任务（IOI、GP、GT）上验证这一视角，分析计算图中节点的低秩方向激活。

Result: 发现先前识别的规范功能头（如名称移动器）编码了多个重叠的子功能，这些子功能与不同的奇异方向对齐；有意义的计算存在于紧凑子空间中。

Conclusion: Transformer计算比先前假设的更加分布式、结构化和组合化，为细粒度机制可解释性和模型内部理解开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models exhibit complex and distributed behavior, yet their internal computations remain poorly understood. Existing mechanistic interpretability methods typically treat attention heads and multilayer perceptron layers (MLPs) (the building blocks of a transformer architecture) as indivisible units, overlooking possibilities of functional substructure learned within them. In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces. While some directions remain challenging to interpret fully, our results highlight that transformer computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than previously assumed. This perspective opens new avenues for fine-grained mechanistic interpretability and a deeper understanding of model internals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练量化方法依赖校准数据，但在实际场景中校准数据可能不可用或受隐私法规限制，需要开发无需校准数据的量化方法。

Method: 设计无校准数据的量化损失代理函数，使用结构化矩阵变换处理单个矩阵，对计算图中直接交互的配对权重使用双矩阵变换和自适应舍入方法。

Result: 在Gemma 2 9B模型上，4位量化平均基准分数从61.9提升到62.4，3位量化从52.0提升到60.6，计算开销增加不到3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需校准数据的情况下实现了与需要校准数据的GPTQ方法相当的性能，为实际部署提供了更灵活的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization is an effective method for reducing the serving cost of large language models, where the standard approach is to use a round-to-nearest quantization level scheme. However, this often introduces large errors due to outliers in the weights. Proposed mitigation mechanisms include applying adaptive rounding, random rotation transformations or committing to a post-training target using calibration data. Unfortunately, this reliance on calibration data can be severely limiting in some real-world scenarios as such data may be unavailable or subject to privacy regulations. In this paper, we propose algorithms to optimize transformations and adaptive rounding without access to any calibration data. The optimization is achieved by designing a suitable proxy function for the quantization loss without calibration data. To maintain inference efficiency, we perform structured matrix transformations for single matrices. For paired weights that interact directly in the computation graph, we use dual matrix transformations and adaptive rounding methods. We conduct experiments on Gemma 2 models, and observe consistent improvement over the baselines. For Gemma 2 9B quantization, our method improves the average benchmark score from 61.9 to 62.4 for 4-bit quantization and from 52.0 to 60.6 for 3-bit quantization, while adding less than 3% of computation overhead. Furthermore, our method achieves performance comparable to the commonly used GPTQ method, which requires calibration data.

Conclusion: LLM隐式学习将语言输入投影到与任务决策对齐的结构化低维流形上，为理解语言模型泛化和推理能力提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong generalization across diverse tasks, yet the internal decision-making processes behind their predictions remain opaque. In this work, we study the geometry of hidden representations in LLMs through the lens of \textit{intrinsic dimension} (ID), focusing specifically on decision-making dynamics in a multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) setting. We perform a large-scale study, with 28 open-weight transformer models and estimate ID across layers using multiple estimators, while also quantifying per-layer performance on MCQA tasks. Our findings reveal a consistent ID pattern across models: early layers operate on low-dimensional manifolds, middle layers expand this space, and later layers compress it again, converging to decision-relevant representations. Together, these results suggest LLMs implicitly learn to project linguistic inputs onto structured, low-dimensional manifolds aligned with task-specific decisions, providing new geometric insights into how generalization and reasoning emerge in language models.

Motivation: 传统机器学习主动学习方法存在冷启动问题和领域特定特征工程的限制，缺乏通用性。大语言模型凭借预训练知识和通用表征能力，为主动学习提供了新范式。

Method: 提出基于LLM的主动学习框架(LLM-AL)，采用迭代少样本设置。探索两种提示策略：简洁数值输入适用于结构化特征数据集，扩展描述文本适用于实验过程特征数据集。

Result: 在所有数据集上，LLM-AL将到达最优候选所需的实验次数减少超过70%，始终优于传统ML模型。LLM-AL执行更广泛探索性搜索，同时以更少迭代达到最优。

Conclusion: LLM-AL可作为传统主动学习管道的通用替代方案，实现更高效和可解释的实验选择，具有LLM驱动自主发现的潜力。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) accelerates scientific discovery by prioritizing the most informative experiments, but traditional machine learning (ML) models used in AL suffer from cold-start limitations and domain-specific feature engineering, restricting their generalizability. Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven autonomous discovery.

Conclusion: SAPO为LLMs的RL训练提供了更可靠、可扩展且有效的优化策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays an increasingly important role in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet stable and performant policy optimization remains challenging. Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes. Overall, SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法结合了影响函数的理论保真度和一阶方法的可扩展性，为大型预训练模型提供了实用、实时的数据归因理论框架。

Abstract: Data attribution seeks to trace model behavior back to the training examples that shaped it, enabling debugging, auditing, and data valuation at scale. Classical influence-function methods offer a principled foundation but remain impractical for modern networks because they require expensive backpropagation or Hessian inversion at inference. We propose a data attribution method that preserves the same first-order counterfactual target while eliminating per-query backward passes. Our approach simulates each training example's parameter influence through short-horizon gradient propagation during training and later reads out attributions for any query using only forward evaluations. This design shifts computation from inference to simulation, reflecting real deployment regimes where a model may serve billions of user queries but originate from a fixed, finite set of data sources (for example, a large language model trained on diverse corpora while compensating a specific publisher such as the New York Times). Empirically, on standard MLP benchmarks, our estimator matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines such as TRAK on standard attribution metrics (LOO and LDS) while offering orders-of-magnitude lower inference cost. By combining influence-function fidelity with first-order scalability, our method provides a theoretical framework for practical, real-time data attribution in large pretrained models.

The proposed approach, Reinforcement Learning for Noisy Label Correction (RLNLC), defines a comprehensive state space representing data and their associated labels, an action space that indicates possible label corrections, and a reward mechanism that evaluates the efficacy of label corrections. RLNLC learns a deep feature representation based policy network to perform label correction through reinforcement learning, utilizing an actor-critic method. The learned policy is subsequently deployed to iteratively correct noisy training labels and facilitate the training of the prediction model. The effectiveness of RLNLC is demonstrated through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, where it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques for learning with noisy labels.

TL;DR: Mosaic Pruning (MoP) 是一种新的稀疏专家混合模型剪枝方法，通过功能聚类和代表性专家选择来保留模型在多样化任务上的能力，解决了现有方法在跨域应用时性能严重下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SMoE模型剪枝方法通常基于单一语料库设计剪枝标准，导致剪枝后的模型在其他领域应用时出现灾难性性能下降，需要为每个新领域重新剪枝，成本高昂。

Method: MoP采用"聚类-选择"结构过程，使用跨任务域的专家性能相似性度量进行功能聚类，然后基于提出的激活变异性评分从每个聚类中选择最具代表性的专家。

Result: 在多种MoE模型上的实验表明，MoP显著优于先前工作，在通用任务上获得7.24%的性能提升，在数学推理和代码生成等专业任务上获得8.92%的提升。

Conclusion: Mosaic Pruning通过保留功能互补的专家集合，使剪枝模型能够处理多样化的下游任务，解决了SMoE模型跨域部署的泛化问题。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have enabled a new frontier in scaling Large Language Models (LLMs), offering superior performance by activating only a fraction of their total parameters during inference. However, their practical deployment is severely hampered by substantial static memory overhead, as all experts must be loaded into memory. Existing post-training pruning methods, while reducing model size, often derive their pruning criteria from a single, general-purpose corpus. This leads to a critical limitation: a catastrophic performance degradation when the pruned model is applied to other domains, necessitating a costly re-pruning for each new domain. To address this generalization gap, we introduce Mosaic Pruning (MoP). The core idea of MoP is to construct a functionally comprehensive set of experts through a structured ``cluster-then-select" process. This process leverages a similarity metric that captures expert performance across different task domains to functionally cluster the experts, and subsequently selects the most representative expert from each cluster based on our proposed Activation Variability Score. Unlike methods that optimize for a single corpus, our proposed Mosaic Pruning ensures that the pruned model retains a functionally complementary set of experts, much like the tiles of a mosaic that together form a complete picture of the original model's capabilities, enabling it to handle diverse downstream tasks.Extensive experiments on various MoE models demonstrate the superiority of our approach. MoP significantly outperforms prior work, achieving a 7.24\% gain on general tasks and 8.92\% on specialized tasks like math reasoning and code generation.

Motivation: 现有基于GNN的图编辑距离(GED)计算方法采用节点中心化匹配范式，这与GED的核心原则存在不匹配，导致无法捕捉全局结构对应关系和对编辑成本的错误归因。

Conclusion: GCGSim通过图级匹配和子结构级编辑成本的方法，解决了现有GNN-based GED方法的局限性，为图相似度计算提供了更准确和一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Similarity Computation (GSC) is a fundamental graph related task where Graph Edit Distance (GED) serves as a prevalent metric. GED is determined by an optimal alignment between a pair of graphs that partitions each into aligned (zero-cost) and unaligned (cost-incurring) substructures. Due to NP-hard nature of exact GED computation, GED approximations based on Graph Neural Network(GNN) have emerged. Existing GNN-based GED approaches typically learn node embeddings for each graph and then aggregate pairwise node similarities to estimate the final similarity. Despite their effectiveness, we identify a mismatch between this prevalent node-centric matching paradigm and the core principles of GED. This discrepancy leads to two critical limitations: (1) a failure to capture the global structural correspondence for optimal alignment, and (2) a misattribution of edit costs driven by spurious node level signals. To address these limitations, we propose GCGSim, a GED-consistent graph similarity learning framework centering on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs. Specifically, we make three core technical contributions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GCGSim achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our comprehensive analyses further validate that the framework effectively learns disentangled and semantically meaningful substructure representations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合分割与联邦学习（HSFL）加速方法，通过联合优化学习模式选择、批次大小以及通信计算资源来减少整体学习延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）支持低延迟并行训练但可能收敛到精度较低的模型，而分割学习（SL）通过顺序训练实现更高精度但延迟增加。为了结合两者的优势，需要研究如何加速混合学习模式。

Method: 首先分析学习模式选择和批次大小对收敛的影响，然后制定延迟最小化问题，提出两阶段解决方案：使用块坐标下降法求解松弛问题获得局部最优解，再通过舍入算法恢复整数批次大小。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比现有方法显著加速了达到目标精度的收敛过程。

Conclusion: 提出的HSFL加速方法通过联合优化学习模式、批次大小和资源分配，有效降低了分布式学习的整体延迟。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are two effective distributed learning paradigms in wireless networks, enabling collaborative model training across mobile devices without sharing raw data. While FL supports low-latency parallel training, it may converge to less accurate model. In contrast, SL achieves higher accuracy through sequential training but suffers from increased delay. To leverage the advantages of both, hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) allows some devices to operate in FL mode and others in SL mode. This paper aims to accelerate HSFL by addressing three key questions: 1) How does learning mode selection affect overall learning performance? 2) How does it interact with batch size? 3) How can these hyperparameters be jointly optimized alongside communication and computational resources to reduce overall learning delay? We first analyze convergence, revealing the interplay between learning mode and batch size. Next, we formulate a delay minimization problem and propose a two-stage solution: a block coordinate descent method for a relaxed problem to obtain a locally optimal solution, followed by a rounding algorithm to recover integer batch sizes with near-optimal performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates convergence to the target accuracy compared to existing methods.

Result: 在多伦多网约车数据上的结果显示，FACT模型在时间依赖性C指数和Brier得分方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现更准确的风险估计，支持平台留存策略，并提供政策相关见解。

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms are characterized by high-frequency, behavior-driven environments. Although survival analysis has been applied to recurrent events in other domains, its use in modeling ride-hailing driver behavior remains largely unexplored. This study formulates idle behavior as a recurrent survival process using large-scale platform data and proposes a Transformer-based framework that captures long-term temporal dependencies with causal masking and incorporates driver-specific embeddings to model latent heterogeneity. Results on Toronto ride-hailing data demonstrate that the proposed Frailty-Aware Cox Transformer (FACT) achieves the highest time-dependent C-indices and lowest Brier Scores, outperforming classical and deep learning survival models. This approach enables more accurate risk estimation, supports platform retention strategies, and provides policy-relevant insights.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) leverages transient-state signal dynamics generated by the tunable acquisition parameters, making the design of an optimal, robust sequence a complex, high-dimensional sequential decision problem, such as optimizing one of the key parameters, flip angle. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach to automate parameter selection, to optimize pulse sequences that maximize the distinguishability of fingerprints across the parameter space. In this work, we introduce an RL framework for optimizing the flip-angle schedule in MRF and demonstrate a learned schedule exhibiting non-periodic patterns that enhances fingerprint separability. Additionally, an interesting observation is that the RL-optimized schedule may enable a reduction in the number of repetition time, potentially accelerate MRF acquisitions.

Conclusion: 差分平滑是一个理论支撑的通用方法，能够同时提升正确性和多样性，优于传统RL方法和现有启发式方法。

Abstract: It is widely recognized that reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models often leads to \textit{diversity collapse}, where outputs lack variety. Prior work has proposed a range of heuristics to counteract this effect, but these methods are ad hoc: they frequently trade off correctness for diversity, their effectiveness varies across tasks, and in some cases they even contradict one another. In this work, we place these observations on a rigorous foundation. We first provide a formal proof of why RL fine-tuning exhibits diversity collapse via a selection and reinforcement bias. Next, we make a key observation that any reward modification to address diversity collapse only needs to be applied on the correct trajectories. Building directly on this analysis, we introduce a principled method -- \textit{differential smoothing} -- that provably improves both correctness and diversity, outperforming vanilla RL as well as widely used entropy-based heuristics. Our theory precisely characterizes when existing heuristics help and why they fail, while showing that differential smoothing is universally superior. Extensive experiments with models from 1B to 7B parameters, across domains including CountDown and real-world mathematical reasoning, demonstrate consistent gains. Differential smoothing improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k, with up to 6.7\% improvements on AIME24 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前向碰撞预警系统在边缘部署时计算成本高，且由于简化的交互模型导致可靠性不足，同时传统静态阈值预警存在高误报率问题。

Method: 使用分层时空注意力网络（HSTAN）进行多智能体交互建模，采用解耦架构（图注意力网络处理空间关系，级联GRU与自注意力处理时序关系），并结合保形分位数回归生成预测区间，通过动态风险阈值调整算法进行预警决策。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂环境中表现出优越性能和实际部署可行性，有效平衡了精确建模与实时决策适应性，显著提高了预警系统的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Forward Collision Warning systems are crucial for vehicle safety and autonomous driving, yet current methods often fail to balance precise multi-agent interaction modeling with real-time decision adaptability, evidenced by the high computational cost for edge deployment and the unreliability stemming from simplified interaction models.To overcome these dual challenges-computational complexity and modeling insufficiency-along with the high false alarm rates of traditional static-threshold warnings, this paper introduces an integrated FCW framework that pairs a Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with a Dynamic Risk Threshold Adjustment algorithm. HSTAN employs a decoupled architecture (Graph Attention Network for spatial, cascaded GRU with self-attention for temporal) to achieve superior performance and efficiency, requiring only 12.3 ms inference time (73% faster than Transformer methods) and reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) to 0.73m (42.2% better than Social_LSTM) on the NGSIM dataset. Furthermore, Conformalized Quantile Regression enhances reliability by generating prediction intervals (91.3% coverage at 90% confidence), which the DTRA module then converts into timely warnings via a physics-informed risk potential function and an adaptive threshold mechanism inspired by statistical process control.Tested across multi-scenario datasets, the complete system demonstrates high efficacy, achieving an F1 score of 0.912, a low false alarm rate of 8.2%, and an ample warning lead time of 2.8 seconds, validating the framework's superior performance and practical deployment feasibility in complex environments.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在不同用户使用不同风格的提示语时，即使询问相同的问题，也会产生质量差异显著的响应，这引发了提示公平性问题。

Method: 使用信息论指标（子组敏感性和跨组一致性）来量化偏差，并提出多数投票和提示中性化等实际干预措施来减少差异。

Result: 实验显示，在缓解前跨组差异值达到0.28，通常在0.14-0.22范围内。应用中性化和多代策略后，差异显著减少，最大差距降至0.22，许多距离降至0.17或以下。

Conclusion: 提出的干预措施能有效减少LLMs在不同人口统计子组间的响应差异，提高模型输出的稳定性和公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), though shown to be effective in many applications, can vary significantly in their response quality. In this paper, we investigate this problem of prompt fairness: specifically, the phrasing of a prompt by different users/styles, despite the same question being asked in principle, may elicit different responses from an LLM. To quantify this disparity, we propose to use information-theoretic metrics that can capture two dimensions of bias: subgroup sensitivity, the variability of responses within a subgroup and cross group consistency, the variability of responses across subgroups. Our analysis reveals that certain subgroups exhibit both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others. Our empirical analysis reveals that certain demographic sub groups experience both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others, indicating structural inequities in model behavior. To mitigate these disparities, we propose practical interventions, including majority voting across multiple generations and prompt neutralization, which together improve response stability and enhance fairness across user populations. In the experiments, we observe clear prompt sensitivity disparities across demographic subgroups: before mitigation, cross-group divergence values reach 0.28 and typically fall in the from 0.14 to 0.22 range. After applying our neutralization and multi generation strategy, these divergences consistently decrease, with the largest gap reduced to 0.22 and many distances falling to 0.17 or below, indicating more stable and consistent outputs across subgroups.

Result: 在通用指令跟随和数学推理任务上的大语言模型微调实验表明，ParaBlock不仅保持了强大的性能，还显著提高了通信效率。

Conclusion: ParaBlock是一种有效的联邦学习大语言模型训练方法，能够在保持性能的同时显著改善通信效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been extensively studied as a privacy-preserving training paradigm. Recently, federated block coordinate descent scheme has become a popular option in training large-scale models, as it allows clients to train only a subset of the model locally instead of the entire model. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), even a single block can contain a significant number of parameters, posing substantial communication latency, particularly for resource-constrained clients. To address this challenge in federated training/fine-tuning LLMs, we propose ParaBlock, a novel approach that establishes two parallel threads for communication and computation to enhance communication efficiency. We theoretically prove that the proposed ParaBlock achieves the same convergence rate as the standard federated block coordinate descent methods. Empirical evaluations on fine-tuning LLMs on general instruction following and mathematical reasoning confirm that ParaBlock not only maintains strong performance but also significantly improves communication efficiency.

Conclusion: FedEcho能够在不访问私有客户端数据的情况下实现稳健性能，有效缓解过时更新和数据异构的负面影响。

Abstract: Asynchronous federated learning (FL) has recently gained attention for its enhanced efficiency and scalability, enabling local clients to send model updates to the server at their own pace without waiting for slower participants. However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedEcho consistently outperforms existing asynchronous federated learning baselines, achieving robust performance without requiring access to private client data.

Abstract: The emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs) has offered a powerful tool for semi-supervised node classification tasks. Subsequent studies have achieved further improvements through refining the message passing schemes in GNN models or exploiting various data augmentation techniques to mitigate limited supervision. In real graphs, nodes often tend to form tightly-knit communities/clusters, which embody abundant signals for compensating label scarcity in semi-supervised node classification but are not explored in prior methods.
  Inspired by this, this paper presents NCGC that integrates self-supervised graph clustering and semi-supervised classification into a unified framework. Firstly, we theoretically unify the optimization objectives of GNNs and spectral graph clustering, and based on that, develop soft orthogonal GNNs (SOGNs) that leverage a refined message passing paradigm to generate node representations for both classification and clustering. On top of that, NCGC includes a self-supervised graph clustering module that enables the training of SOGNs for learning representations of unlabeled nodes in a self-supervised manner. Particularly, this component comprises two non-trivial clustering objectives and a Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization that transforms predicted cluster assignments into balanced soft pseudo-labels. Through combining the foregoing clustering module with the classification model using a multi-task objective containing the supervised classification loss on labeled data and self-supervised clustering loss on unlabeled data, NCGC promotes synergy between them and achieves enhanced model capacity. Our extensive experiments showcase that the proposed NCGC framework consistently and considerably outperforms popular GNN models and recent baselines for semi-supervised node classification on seven real graphs, when working with various classic GNN backbones.

Abstract: Neural operator learning methods have garnered significant attention in scientific computing for their ability to approximate infinite-dimensional operators. However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.

Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have emerged as go-to models for learning on graph-structured data in the past decade. Despite their effectiveness, most of such models still incur severe issues such as over-smoothing and -correlation, due to their underlying objective of minimizing the Dirichlet energy and the derived neighborhood aggregation operations. In this paper, we propose the DDSM, a new MPNN model built on an optimization framework that includes the stress majorization and orthogonal regularization for overcoming the above issues. Further, we introduce the diffusion distances for nodes into the framework to guide the new message passing operations and develop efficient algorithms for distance approximations, both backed by rigorous theoretical analyses. Our comprehensive experiments showcase that DDSM consistently and considerably outperforms 15 strong baselines on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: Sparsity is essential for deploying large models on resource constrained edge platforms. However, optimizing sparsity patterns for individual tasks in isolation ignores the significant I/O overhead incurred during frequent task switching. We introduce an on-demand multi-task sparsity framework specifically designed to minimize switching costs by maximizing parameter reuse. Unlike monolithic approaches, we decompose weights into reusable block-granular units and align sparse structures across tasks to maximize overlap. By dynamically loading only the small differential set of blocks required for the next task, our method effectively mitigates the cold-start latency inherent in traditional monolithic approaches.Experiments on a real-world autonomous driving platform demonstrate that our framework achieves superior switching efficiency, accelerating task switching by over 6.6X on average compared to existing sparsity methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RankOOD是一种基于排序的OOD检测方法，使用Plackett-Luce损失训练模型，在TinyImageNet基准上实现SOTA性能，将FPR95降低4.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于交叉熵损失训练的深度学习模型在ID类别预测中会诱导出每个ID类别的排序模式，这一观察启发了基于排序的OOD检测方法。

Method: 首先使用初始分类器为每个类别提取排序列表，然后使用Plackett-Luce损失进行第二轮训练，其中类别排序作为预测变量。

Result: 在近OOD TinyImageNet评估基准上达到最先进性能，FPR95降低4.3%。

Conclusion: RankOOD框架通过利用类别排序模式有效检测OOD样本，即使OOD样本可能被高概率分配给ID类别，但遵守排序分类的概率很小。

Abstract: We propose RankOOD, a rank-based Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection approach based on training a model with the Placket-Luce loss, which is now extensively used for preference alignment tasks in foundational models. Our approach is based on the insight that with a deep learning model trained using the Cross Entropy Loss, in-distribution (ID) class prediction induces a ranking pattern for each ID class prediction. The RankOOD framework formalizes the insight by first extracting a rank list for each class using an initial classifier and then uses another round of training with the Plackett-Luce loss, where the class rank, a fixed permutation for each class, is the predicted variable. An OOD example may get assigned with high probability to an ID example, but the probability of it respecting the ranking classification is likely to be small. RankOOD, achieves SOTA performance on the near-ODD TinyImageNet evaluation benchmark, reducing FPR95 by 4.3%.

*Nikit Phadke*

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一各种相似性度量方法，提供模块化、可组合的相似性系统设计框架，避免依赖特定哈希函数工程。

Method: 使用有限见证集、半随机位分配和重叠单调性，在满足重叠间隙条件下，用O(log(|V|/δ))位编码保证top-k排名保持。

Result: 证明了相似性系统可模块化构建，包含Bloom过滤器、minhash、LSH等作为特例，提供对数级编码复杂度。

Conclusion: REWA为基于见证重叠的相似性系统提供了理论基础，支持组合设计，未来可扩展多比特编码、加权见证和非集合表示。

Abstract: REWA introduces a general theory of similarity based on witness-overlap structures. We show that whenever similarity between concepts can be expressed as monotone witness overlap -- whether arising from graph neighborhoods, causal relations, temporal structure, topological features, symbolic patterns, or embedding-based neighborhoods -- it admits a reduction to compact encodings with provable ranking preservation guarantees. REWA systems consist of: (1) finite witness sets $W(v)$, (2) semi-random bit assignments generated from each witness, and (3) monotonicity of expected similarity in the overlap $Δ(u, v) = |W(u) \cap W(v)|$. We prove that under an overlap-gap condition on the final witness sets -- independent of how they were constructed -- top-$k$ rankings are preserved using $m = O(\log(|V|/δ))$ bits. The witness-set formulation is compositional: any sequence of structural, temporal, causal, topological, information-theoretic, or learned transformations can be combined into pipelines that terminate in discrete witness sets. The theory applies to the final witness overlap, enabling modular construction of similarity systems from reusable primitives. This yields a vast design space: millions of composable similarity definitions inherit logarithmic encoding complexity. REWA subsumes and unifies Bloom filters, minhash, LSH bitmaps, random projections, sketches, and hierarchical filters as special cases. It provides a principled foundation for similarity systems whose behavior is governed by witness overlap rather than hash-function engineering. This manuscript presents the axioms, the main reducibility theorem, complete proofs with explicit constants, and a detailed discussion of compositional design, limitations, and future extensions including multi-bit encodings, weighted witnesses, and non-set representations.

Result: Sundial在零样本设置下，当输入上下文窗口覆盖超过1-2个完整季节周期时，能够超越完全训练的LSTM模型。

Conclusion: 首次证明通用基础模型可以在不进行任务特定调优的情况下，在遥感时间序列预测上超越专门的监督模型，展示了预训练时间序列基础模型在农业和环境应用中作为即插即用预测器的强大潜力。

Abstract: This work investigates the zero-shot forecasting capability of time-series foundation models for Leaf Area Index (LAI) forecasting in agricultural monitoring. Using the HiQ dataset (U.S., 2000-2022), we systematically compare statistical baselines, a fully supervised LSTM, and the Sundial foundation model under multiple evaluation protocols. We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning. These results highlight the strong potential of pretrained time-series foundation models to serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications.

Method: DGF方案包含特征级去噪组件和三交叉对比训练策略，通过跨模态、跨邻居和跨社区的实例级对比学习学习鲁棒节点表示

Conclusion: DGF通过双图滤波和对比学习有效解决了多模态属性图中的聚类挑战，为复杂数据场景提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MMAGs) are an expressive data model for representing the complex interconnections among entities that associate attributes from multiple data modalities (text, images, etc.). Clustering over such data finds numerous practical applications in real scenarios, including social community detection, medical data analytics, etc. However, as revealed by our empirical studies, existing multi-view clustering solutions largely rely on the high correlation between attributes across various views and overlook the unique characteristics (e.g., low modality-wise correlation and intense feature-wise noise) of multimodal attributes output by large pre-trained language and vision models in MMAGs, leading to suboptimal clustering performance.
  Inspired by foregoing empirical observations and our theoretical analyses with graph signal processing, we propose the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, which innovatively incorporates a feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning, thereby effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional graph filters adopted in the extant multi-view graph clustering approaches. On top of that, DGF includes a tri-cross contrastive training strategy that employs instance-level contrastive learning across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities for learning robust and discriminative node representations. Our comprehensive experiments on eight benchmark MMAG datasets exhibit that DGF is able to outperform a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines consistently and significantly in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels.

Motivation: 现有无监督方法在仅使用正常数据训练时，倾向于重构正常模式，当面对微弱异常前兆时，预测结果被正常模式主导，淹没了预测所需的信号。

Method: RED-F包含重构消除模型(REM)和双流对比预测模型(DFM)。REM使用混合时频机制消除前兆生成纯净基线，DFM接收纯净基线和保留前兆的原始序列进行对比预测，采用多序列预测目标增强预测敏感性。

Result: 在六个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，RED-F在异常预测任务中具有卓越能力。

Conclusion: RED-F通过重构消除和双流对比预测框架，成功解决了多元时间序列中微弱异常前兆的预测难题，将绝对信号检测转化为更简单的相对轨迹比较任务。

Abstract: The proactive prediction of anomalies (AP) in multivariate time series (MTS) is a critical challenge to ensure system dependability. The difficulty lies in identifying subtle anomaly precursors concealed within normal signals. However, existing unsupervised methods, trained exclusively on normal data, demonstrate a fundamental propensity to reconstruct normal patterns. Consequently, when confronted with weak precursors, their predictions are dominated by the normal pattern, submerging the very signal required for prediction. To contend with the limitation, we propose RED-F, a Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting framework, comprising the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). The REM utilizes a hybrid time-frequency mechanism to mitigate the precursor, generating a purified, normal-pattern baseline. The DFM then receives this purified baseline and the original sequence which retains the precursor as parallel inputs. At the core of our framework, RED-F employs a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult task of absolute signal detection into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictive streams. This contrastive mechanism serves to amplify the faint precursor signal. Furthermore, the DFM is trained with a novel Multi-Series Prediction (MSP) objective, which leverages distant future context to enhance its predictive sensitivity. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior capability of RED-F in anomaly prediction tasks.

Conclusion: SOMBRL为模型强化学习提供了灵活、可扩展的原则性探索解决方案，展示了原则性探索在MBRL中的益处。

Abstract: We address the challenge of efficient exploration in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where the system dynamics are unknown and the RL agent must learn directly from online interactions. We propose Scalable and Optimistic MBRL (SOMBRL), an approach based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. SOMBRL learns an uncertainty-aware dynamics model and greedily maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and the agent's epistemic uncertainty. SOMBRL is compatible with any policy optimizers or planners, and under common regularity assumptions on the system, we show that SOMBRL has sublinear regret for nonlinear dynamics in the (i) finite-horizon, (ii) discounted infinite-horizon, and (iii) non-episodic settings. Additionally, SOMBRL offers a flexible and scalable solution for principled exploration. We evaluate SOMBRL on state-based and visual-control environments, where it displays strong performance across all tasks and baselines. We also evaluate SOMBRL on a dynamic RC car hardware and show SOMBRL outperforms the state-of-the-art, illustrating the benefits of principled exploration for MBRL.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖自由形式的自然语言描述存在模糊、冗余和非结构化问题，给下游Verilog代码生成带来挑战。需要将硬件代码生成视为从开放自然语言空间到高度约束目标空间的复杂转换。

Method: 引入CRUX结构化中间空间捕获用户意图本质语义，设计两阶段训练框架：联合表达建模和双空间优化，提升CRUX和Verilog代码质量。

Result: 在多个Verilog生成基准测试中，CRUX-V模型在通用模型中达到最先进性能，尤其在挑战性设计任务中表现突出。CRUX空间具有可迁移性，作为输入提示能提升其他代码模型性能。

Conclusion: CRUX空间有效缩小了自由形式自然语言描述与精确Verilog生成之间的差距，结构化中间表示对硬件代码生成任务具有重要价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in hardware description language (HDL) generation. However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model for both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting of Bitcoin realized volatility. Utilizing a comprehensive set of 69 predictors -- encompassing market, behavioral, and macroeconomic indicators -- we evaluate the performance of LGBM-based models and compare them with both econometric and machine learning baselines. For probabilistic forecasting, we explore two quantile-based approaches: direct quantile regression using the pinball loss function, and a residual simulation method that transforms point forecasts into predictive distributions. To identify the main drivers of volatility, we employ gain-based and permutation feature importance techniques, consistently highlighting the significance of trading volume, lagged volatility measures, investor attention, and market capitalization. The results demonstrate that LGBM models effectively capture the nonlinear and high-variance characteristics of cryptocurrency markets while providing interpretable insights into the underlying volatility dynamics.

Conclusion: 多智能体协调、动态API感知和自校正执行显著提升了气候科学分析任务的端到端自动化可靠性。

Abstract: Climate science demands automated workflows to transform comprehensive questions into data-driven statements across massive, heterogeneous datasets. However, generic LLM agents and static scripting pipelines lack climate-specific context and flexibility, thus, perform poorly in practice. We present ClimateAgent, an autonomous multi-agent framework that orchestrates end-to-end climate data analytic workflows. ClimateAgent decomposes user questions into executable sub-tasks coordinated by an Orchestrate-Agent and a Plan-Agent; acquires data via specialized Data-Agents that dynamically introspect APIs to synthesize robust download scripts; and completes analysis and reporting with a Coding-Agent that generates Python code, visualizations, and a final report with a built-in self-correction loop. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce Climate-Agent-Bench-85, a benchmark of 85 real-world tasks spanning atmospheric rivers, drought, extreme precipitation, heat waves, sea surface temperature, and tropical cyclones. On Climate-Agent-Bench-85, ClimateAgent achieves 100% task completion and a report quality score of 8.32, outperforming GitHub-Copilot (6.27) and a GPT-5 baseline (3.26). These results demonstrate that our multi-agent orchestration with dynamic API awareness and self-correcting execution substantially advances reliable, end-to-end automation for climate science analytic tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural network compression that addresses redundancy at both the filter and architectural levels through a unified framework grounded in information flow analysis. Building on the concept of tensor flow divergence, which quantifies how information is transformed across network layers, we develop a two-stage optimization process. The first stage employs iterative divergence-aware pruning to identify and remove redundant filters while preserving critical information pathways. The second stage extends this principle to higher-level architecture optimization by analyzing layer-wise contributions to information propagation and selectively eliminating entire layers that demonstrate minimal impact on network performance. The proposed method naturally adapts to diverse architectures, including convolutional networks, transformers, and hybrid designs, providing a consistent metric for comparing the structural importance across different layer types. Experimental validation across multiple modern architectures and datasets reveals that this combined approach achieves substantial model compression while maintaining competitive accuracy. The presented approach achieves parameter reduction results that are globally comparable to those of state-of-the-art solutions and outperforms them across a wide range of modern neural network architectures, from convolutional models to transformers. The results demonstrate how flow divergence serves as an effective guiding principle for both filter-level and layer-level optimization, offering practical benefits for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 动量方法在联邦学习的统计异质性环境中存在固有局限性，无法完全解决收敛问题，需要其他技术来应对异质性挑战。

Abstract: Recent works have explored the use of momentum in local methods to enhance distributed SGD. This is particularly appealing in Federated Learning (FL), where momentum intuitively appears as a solution to mitigate the effects of statistical heterogeneity. Despite recent progress in this direction, it is still unclear if momentum can guarantee convergence under unbounded heterogeneity in decentralized scenarios, where only some workers participate at each round. In this work we analyze momentum under cyclic client participation, and theoretically prove that it remains inevitably affected by statistical heterogeneity. Similarly to SGD, we prove that decreasing step-sizes do not help either: in fact, any schedule decreasing faster than $Θ\left(1/t\right)$ leads to convergence to a constant value that depends on the initialization and the heterogeneity bound. Numerical results corroborate the theory, and deep learning experiments confirm its relevance for realistic settings.

Abstract: Neural networks struggle on small tabular datasets, where tree-based models remain dominant. We introduce Adaptive Contrastive Approach (AdaCap), a training scheme that combines a permutation-based contrastive loss with a Tikhonov-based closed-form output mapping. Across 85 real-world regression datasets and multiple architectures, AdaCap yields consistent and statistically significant improvements in the small-sample regime, particularly for residual models. A meta-predictor trained on dataset characteristics (size, skewness, noise) accurately anticipates when AdaCap is beneficial. These results show that AdaCap acts as a targeted regularization mechanism, strengthening neural networks precisely where they are most fragile.

Abstract: Discovering subgroups with the maximum average treatment effect is crucial for targeted decision making in domains such as precision medicine, public policy, and education. While most prior work is formulated in the potential outcome framework, the corresponding structural causal model (SCM) for this task has been largely overlooked. In practice, two approaches dominate. The first estimates pointwise conditional treatment effects and then fits a tree on those estimates, effectively turning subgroup estimation into the harder problem of accurate pointwise estimation. The second constructs decision trees or rule sets with ad-hoc 'causal' heuristics, typically without rigorous justification for why a given heuristic may be used or whether such heuristics are necessary at all. We address these issues by studying the problem directly under the SCM framework. Under the assumption of a partition-based model, we show that optimal subgroup discovery reduces to recovering the data-generating models and hence a standard supervised learning problem (regression or classification). This allows us to adopt any partition-based methods to learn the subgroup from data. We instantiate the approach with CART, arguably one of the most widely used tree-based methods, to learn the subgroup with maximum treatment effect. Finally, on a large collection of synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we compare our method against a wide range of baselines and find that our approach, which avoids such causal heuristics, more accurately identifies subgroups with maximum treatment effect.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success across language, vision, and multimodal tasks, and there is growing demand for them to address in-context compositional learning tasks. In these tasks, models solve the target problems by inferring compositional rules from context examples, which are composed of basic components structured by underlying rules. However, some of these tasks remain challenging for Transformers, which are not inherently designed to handle compositional tasks and offer limited structural inductive bias. In this work, inspired by the principle of sparse coding, we propose a reformulation of the attention to enhance its capability for compositional tasks. In sparse coding, data are represented as sparse combinations of dictionary atoms with coefficients that capture their compositional rules. Specifically, we reinterpret the attention block as a mapping of inputs into outputs through projections onto two sets of learned dictionary atoms: an encoding dictionary and a decoding dictionary. The encoding dictionary decomposes the input into a set of coefficients, which represent the compositional structure of the input. To enhance structured representations, we impose sparsity on these coefficients. The sparse coefficients are then used to linearly combine the decoding dictionary atoms to generate the output. Furthermore, to assist compositional generalization tasks, we propose estimating the coefficients of the target problem as a linear combination of the coefficients obtained from the context examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the S-RAVEN and RAVEN datasets. For certain compositional generalization tasks, our method maintains performance even when standard Transformers fail, owing to its ability to learn and apply compositional rules.

TL;DR: 提出SR-GM方法解决多模态图神经网络训练中的梯度冲突和结构噪声放大问题，通过梯度解耦和结构阻尼正则化实现高效图压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态图在关键Web应用中日益重要，但大规模训练带来巨大计算负担。现有图压缩方法在多模态设置中失效，主要由于模态间语义不对齐导致的梯度冲突，以及GNN消息传递架构对梯度噪声的放大效应。

Method: SR-GM框架包含两个协同组件：1）梯度解耦机制，通过正交投影解决模态间梯度冲突；2）结构阻尼正则化器，利用图的Dirichlet能量将拓扑结构从噪声放大器转变为稳定力。

Result: 实验表明SR-GM相比基线方法显著提高精度并加速收敛。消融研究证实同时解决梯度冲突和结构放大对获得优越性能至关重要。压缩后的多模态图展现出强大的跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为资源受限环境中的多模态图学习提供了可扩展的方法论，有望加速神经架构搜索等应用。

Abstract: In critical web applications such as e-commerce and recommendation systems, multimodal graphs integrating rich visual and textual attributes are increasingly central, yet their large scale introduces substantial computational burdens for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While Graph Condensation (GC) offers a promising solution by synthesizing smaller datasets, existing methods falter in the multimodal setting. We identify a dual challenge causing this failure: (1) conflicting gradients arising from semantic misalignments between modalities, and (2) the GNN's message-passing architecture pathologically amplifying this gradient noise across the graph structure. To address this, we propose Structurally-Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a novel condensation framework tailored for multimodal graphs. SR-GM introduces two synergistic components: first, a gradient decoupling mechanism that resolves inter-modality conflicts at their source via orthogonal projection; and second, a structural damping regularizer that acts directly on the gradient field. By leveraging the graph's Dirichlet energy, this regularizer transforms the topology from a noise amplifier into a stabilizing force during optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SR-GM significantly improves accuracy and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that addressing both gradient conflict and structural amplification in tandem is essential for achieving superior performance. Moreover, the condensed multimodal graphs exhibit strong cross-architecture generalization and promise to accelerate applications like Neural Architecture Search. This research provides a scalable methodology for multimodal graph-based learning in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: DiCaP通过分布校准的伪标签加权和双阈值策略，有效提升了半监督多标签学习的性能

Abstract: Semi-supervised multi-label learning (SSMLL) aims to address the challenge of limited labeled data in multi-label learning (MLL) by leveraging unlabeled data to improve the model's performance. While pseudo-labeling has become a dominant strategy in SSMLL, most existing methods assign equal weights to all pseudo-labels regardless of their quality, which can amplify the impact of noisy or uncertain predictions and degrade the overall performance. In this paper, we theoretically verify that the optimal weight for a pseudo-label should reflect its correctness likelihood. Empirically, we observe that on the same dataset, the correctness likelihood distribution of unlabeled data remains stable, even as the number of labeled training samples varies. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling (DiCaP), a correctness-aware framework that estimates posterior precision to calibrate pseudo-label weights. We further introduce a dual-thresholding mechanism to separate confident and ambiguous regions: confident samples are pseudo-labeled and weighted accordingly, while ambiguous ones are explored by unsupervised contrastive learning. Experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets verify that our method achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to 4.27%.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升RL智能体的泛化性能

Abstract: Generalizability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents (ability to perform on environments different from the ones they have been trained on) is a key problem as agents have the tendency to overfit to their training environments. In order to address this problem and offer a solution to increase the generalizability of RL agents, we introduce a new methodology to predict the generalizability score of RL agents based on the internal weights of the agent's neural networks. Using this prediction capability, we propose some changes in the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) loss function to boost the generalization score of the agents trained with this upgraded version. Experimental results demonstrate that our improved PPO algorithm yields agents with stronger generalizability compared to the original version.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的空气污染预测对公共健康至关重要，但现有模型在性能和可解释性之间存在权衡。

Method: 将污染物浓度的时空行为分解为两个透明加性模块：物理引导的传输核（考虑风和地理条件）和可解释的注意力机制（学习局部响应并归因到历史滞后和外部驱动因素）。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable air pollution forecasting is crucial for public health, but most models face a trade-off between performance and interpretability. This study proposes a physics-guided, interpretable-by-design spatiotemporal learning framework. The model decomposes the spatiotemporal behavior of air pollutant concentrations into two transparent, additive modules. The first is a physics-guided transport kernel with directed weights conditioned on wind and geography (advection). The second is an explainable attention mechanism that learns local responses and attributes future concentrations to specific historical lags and exogenous drivers. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from the Stockholm region, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple forecasting horizons. Our model's integration of high predictive performance and spatiotemporal interpretability provides a more reliable foundation for operational air-quality management in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出了Anon优化器，通过可调节的自适应机制在SGD和Adam之间插值甚至外推，解决了自适应优化器泛化能力差的问题，并在多种任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自适应优化器（如Adam）在大规模模型训练中表现出色，但在传统架构上泛化能力不如非自适应方法（如SGD），主要原因是预调节器的自适应特性限制了优化器适应不同优化环境的能力。

Method: 提出Anon优化器，具有连续可调的自适应特性，能够实现SGD和Adam行为之间的插值和外推；引入增量延迟更新（IDU）机制，比AMSGrad的硬最大跟踪策略更灵活，增强了对梯度噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: 在凸和非凸设置下建立了理论收敛保证；在图像分类、扩散模型和语言建模等代表性任务上，Anon始终优于最先进的优化器。

Conclusion: 自适应可以作为有价值的可调设计原则，Anon提供了第一个统一可靠的框架，能够弥合传统和现代优化器之间的差距，并超越它们的优势特性。

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers such as Adam have achieved great success in training large-scale models like large language models and diffusion models. However, they often generalize worse than non-adaptive methods, such as SGD on classical architectures like CNNs. We identify a key cause of this performance gap: adaptivity in pre-conditioners, which limits the optimizer's ability to adapt to diverse optimization landscapes. To address this, we propose Anon (Adaptivity Non-restricted Optimizer with Novel convergence technique), a novel optimizer with continuously tunable adaptivity
  , allowing it to interpolate between SGD-like and Adam-like behaviors and even extrapolate beyond both. To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks. These results demonstrate that adaptivity can serve as a valuable tunable design principle, and Anon provides the first unified and reliable framework capable of bridging the gap between classical and modern optimizers and surpassing their advantageous properties.

Motivation: 解决VVC帧内分区中RDO穷举搜索的高计算复杂度问题，现有方法存在尺寸依赖性和未充分利用相邻块信息的问题。

Method: 方法1：回归技术预测CU的归一化RD成本；方法2：将分区决策建模为MDP，使用DQN算法训练RL智能体。两种方法都利用相邻块的RD成本作为输入特征。

Result: 提出的方法具有尺寸独立性，并整合了相邻块的RD成本信息，通过预设阈值来选择合适的分区方案。

Conclusion: 两种机器学习方法都能有效加速VVC帧内分区的RDO过程，其中RL方法特别适合处理具有马尔可夫性质的分区决策问题。

Abstract: In this paper, a complexity study is conducted for Versatile Video Codec (VVC) intra partitioning to accelerate the exhaustive search involved in Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) process. To address this problem, two main machine learning techniques are proposed and compared. Unlike existing methods, the proposed approaches are size independent and incorporate the Rate-Distortion (RD) costs of neighboring blocks as input features. The first method is a regression based technique that predicts normalized RD costs of a given Coding Unit (CU). As partitioning possesses the Markov property, the associated decision-making problem can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by Reinforcement Learning (RL). The second approach is a RL agent learned from trajectories of CU decision across two depths with Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. Then a pre-determined thresholds are applied for both methods to select a suitable split for the current CU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为MPNNs的信息过压缩问题主要出现在长距离任务中，但作者发现短距离任务同样存在此问题，这促使他们重新审视过压缩现象的本质机制。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，将过压缩现象分解为瓶颈现象和梯度消失现象，并比较MPNNs、带虚拟节点的MPNNs以及Transformer在不同距离任务上的表现。

Result: 发现短距离瓶颈现象无法被现有过压缩理论解释，虚拟节点无法解决此问题，而Transformer在短距离和长距离任务上都能有效处理过压缩问题。

Conclusion: Transformer相比专门的MPNNs是解决过压缩问题更有效的方案，因为它能同时处理短距离瓶颈和长距离梯度消失问题。

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are widely used for learning on graphs, but their ability to process long-range information is limited by the phenomenon of oversquashing. This limitation has led some researchers to advocate Graph Transformers as a better alternative, whereas others suggest that it can be mitigated within the MPNN framework, using virtual nodes or other rewiring techniques.
  In this work, we demonstrate that oversquashing is not limited to long-range tasks, but can also arise in short-range problems. This observation allows us to disentangle two distinct mechanisms underlying oversquashing: (1) the bottleneck phenomenon, which can arise even in low-range settings, and (2) the vanishing gradient phenomenon, which is closely associated with long-range tasks.
  We further show that the short-range bottleneck effect is not captured by existing explanations for oversquashing, and that adding virtual nodes does not resolve it. In contrast, transformers do succeed in such tasks, positioning them as the more compelling solution to oversquashing, compared to specialized MPNNs.

Result: MoRE在批次鲁棒性和生物保守性方面达到竞争性表现，同时相比完全微调模型显著减少可训练参数。

Conclusion: MoRE是实现通用组学基础模型的实用步骤，能够生成跨未见细胞类型和平台泛化的结构保持嵌入。

Abstract: Representation learning on multi-omics data is challenging due to extreme dimensionality, modality heterogeneity, and cohort-specific batch effects. While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms. We benchmark MoRE against established baselines, including scGPT, scVI, and Harmony with scArches, evaluating integration fidelity, rare population detection, and modality transfer. Our results demonstrate that MoRE achieves competitive batch robustness and biological conservation while significantly reducing trainable parameters compared to fully fine-tuned models. This work positions MoRE as a practical step toward general-purpose omics foundation models.

Motivation: 自2012年以来，欧洲温带水域的双壳类软体动物中发现河豚毒素，导致食品安全风险和经济损失。需要早期预测TTX污染以保护食品工业和监管机构。

Method: 开发了基于深度学习的可解释预测模型，输入气象和水文特征，输出TTX污染的存在或缺失。

Conclusion: 可解释深度学习模型识别出日照小时数、全球辐射、水温和水氯化物浓度与TTX污染相关，该方法可作为减轻海洋毒素风险的有价值工具。

Abstract: Since 2012, tetrodotoxin (TTX) has been found in seafoods such as bivalve mollusks in temperate European waters. TTX contamination leads to food safety risks and economic losses, making early prediction of TTX contamination vital to the food industry and competent authorities. Recent studies have pointed to shallow habitats and water temperature as main drivers to TTX contamination in bivalve mollusks. However, the temporal relationships between abiotic factors, biotic factors, and TTX contamination remain unexplored.
  We have developed an explainable, deep learning-based model to predict TTX contamination in the Dutch Zeeland estuary. Inputs for the model were meteorological and hydrological features; output was the presence or absence of TTX contamination.
  Results showed that the time of sunrise, time of sunset, global radiation, water temperature, and chloride concentration contributed most to TTX contamination. Thus, the effective number of sun hours, represented by day length and global radiation, was an important driver for tetrodotoxin contamination in bivalve mollusks.
  To conclude, our explainable deep learning model identified the aforementioned environmental factors (number of sun hours, global radiation, water temperature, and water chloride concentration) to be associated with tetrodotoxin contamination in bivalve mollusks; making our approach a valuable tool to mitigate marine toxin risks for food industry and competent authorities.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their stealthy and long-term nature. Modern supervised learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world cybersecurity environments. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that leverages AutoEncoders for unsupervised anomaly detection, augmented by active learning to iteratively improve the detection of APT anomalies. By selectively querying an oracle for labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, we minimize labeling costs while improving detection rates, enabling the model to improve its detection accuracy with minimal data while reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. We provide a detailed formulation of the proposed Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and show how the active learning loop iteratively enhances the model. The framework is evaluated on real-world imbalanced provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\% of the data. The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. The results have shown significant improvements in detection rates during active learning and better performance compared to other existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有的Q学习方法在样本效率和计算成本方面存在不足，特别是在学习Whittle指数时。BLINQ旨在提供一种更高效、更准确的替代方案。

Method: BLINQ通过构建马尔可夫决策过程的经验估计，然后使用扩展版的最先进算法计算其Whittle指数。

Result: BLINQ在样本数量上显著优于现有的Q学习方法，能够以更少的样本获得准确近似。在计算成本方面，对于任何合理大量的样本，其总计算成本甚至低于Q学习。

Conclusion: BLINQ是一种高效且准确的Whittle指数学习方法，在样本效率和计算成本方面均优于现有方法，即使在使用预训练神经网络加速Q学习的情况下也是如此。

Abstract: We present BLINQ, a new model-based algorithm that learns the Whittle indices of an indexable, communicating and unichain Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach relies on building an empirical estimate of the MDP and then computing its Whittle indices using an extended version of a state-of-the-art existing algorithm. We provide a proof of convergence to the Whittle indices we want to learn as well as a bound on the time needed to learn them with arbitrary precision. Moreover, we investigate its computational complexity. Our numerical experiments suggest that BLINQ significantly outperforms existing Q-learning approaches in terms of the number of samples needed to get an accurate approximation. In addition, it has a total computational cost even lower than Q-learning for any reasonably high number of samples. These observations persist even when the Q-learning algorithms are speeded up using pre-trained neural networks to predict Q-values.

Conclusion: MTBBench为推进多模态LLM在精准肿瘤学中的推理能力、可靠性和工具使用提供了一个具有挑战性和现实性的测试平台。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for biomedical reasoning, but current benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of real-world clinical workflows. Existing evaluations primarily assess unimodal, decontextualized question-answering, overlooking multi-agent decision-making environments such as Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs). MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time. Current benchmarks lack this longitudinal and multimodal complexity. We introduce MTBBench, an agentic benchmark simulating MTB-style decision-making through clinically challenging, multimodal, and longitudinal oncology questions. Ground truth annotations are validated by clinicians via a co-developed app, ensuring clinical relevance. We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities. To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively. Overall, MTBBench offers a challenging and realistic testbed for advancing multimodal LLM reasoning, reliability, and tool-use with a focus on MTB environments in precision oncology.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) pose a major cybersecurity challenge due to their stealth, persistence, and adaptability. Traditional machine learning detectors struggle with class imbalance, high dimensional features, and scarce real world traces. They often lack transferability-performing well in the training domain but degrading in novel attack scenarios. We propose a hybrid transfer framework that integrates Transfer Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), contrastive learning, and Siamese networks to improve cross-domain generalization. An attention-based autoencoder supports knowledge transfer across domains, while Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) select stable, informative features to reduce dimensionality and computational cost. A Siamese encoder trained with a contrastive objective aligns source and target representations, increasing anomaly separability and mitigating feature drift. We evaluate on real-world traces from the DARPA Transparent Computing (TC) program and augment with synthetic attack scenarios to test robustness. Across source to target transfers, the approach delivers improved detection scores with classical and deep baselines, demonstrating a scalable, explainable, and transferable solution for APT detection.

*Misha Padidar,Teresa Huang,Andrew Giuliani,Marina Spivak*

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仿星器设计通常需要大量计算时间，而机器学习方法可以利用大型优化仿星器数据集来加速设计过程。

Method: 在QUASR数据库上训练条件扩散模型，生成具有特定特性（纵横比和平均旋转变换）的准对称仿星器设计。

Result: 生成的仿星器表现出良好性能：准对称性偏差小于5%，且符合目标特性，展示了达到低于1%偏差的潜力。

Conclusion: 生成建模为推进仿星器设计提供了有前景的途径，特别是在快速生成高质量设计方面。

Abstract: Stellarators are a prospective class of fusion-based power plants that confine a hot plasma with three-dimensional magnetic fields. Typically framed as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, stellarator design is a time-consuming process that can take hours to solve on a computing cluster. Developing fast methods for designing stellarators is crucial for advancing fusion research. Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target. Beyond the case study, we share multiple promising avenues for generative modeling to advance stellarator design.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into web browsers introduces security challenges that go beyond traditional web application threat models. Prior work has identified prompt injection as a new attack vector for web agents, yet the resulting impact within real-world environments remains insufficiently understood.
  In this work, we examine the landscape of prompt injection attacks and synthesize a benchmark of attacks embedded in realistic HTML payloads. Our benchmark goes beyond prior work by emphasizing injections that can influence real-world actions rather than mere text outputs, and by presenting attack payloads with complexity and distractor frequency similar to what real-world agents encounter. We leverage this benchmark to conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing defenses, assessing their effectiveness across a suite of frontier AI models. We propose a multi-layered defense strategy comprising both architectural and model-based defenses to protect against evolving prompt injection attacks. Our work offers a blueprint for designing practical, secure web agents through a defense-in-depth approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了CSI深度学习模型在不同威胁模型下的鲁棒性，发现小型模型虽然高效但在对抗攻击下明显更脆弱，物理可实现扰动比无约束攻击更难成功，对抗训练能有效缓解这些漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在基于CSI的人类感知系统中日益重要，这些系统的安全性和可靠性受到对抗性扰动的威胁，因此需要量化理解模型鲁棒性以确保无线感知在真实环境中的安全部署。

Method: 建立框架比较紧凑时间自编码器模型与大型深度架构，在三个公共数据集上评估白盒、黑盒/迁移和通用扰动等不同威胁模型，分析模型规模、训练机制和物理约束对鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 实验表明小型模型在干净数据上表现同等但鲁棒性显著较差；物理可实现信号空间扰动相比无约束特征空间攻击成功率显著降低；对抗训练能提高平均鲁棒精度，仅对干净性能造成适度下降。

Conclusion: 研究结果为鲁棒性评估提供了定量基准，并为设计安全可信的人类中心感知系统提供了指导原则，推动无线感知向可靠跨域操作发展。

Abstract: Machine learning has become integral to Channel State Information (CSI)-based human sensing systems and is expected to power applications such as device-free activity recognition and identity detection in future cellular and Wi-Fi generations. However, these systems rely on models whose decisions can be subtly perturbed, raising concerns for security and reliability in ubiquitous sensing. Quantifying and understanding the robustness of such models, defined as their ability to maintain accurate predictions under adversarial perturbations, is therefore critical before wireless sensing can be safely deployed in real-world environments.
  This work presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of CSI deep learning models under diverse threat models (white-box, black-box/transfer, and universal perturbations) and varying degrees of attack realism. We establish a framework to compare compact temporal autoencoder models with larger deep architectures across three public datasets, quantifying how model scale, training regime, and physical constraints influence robustness. Our experiments show that smaller models, while efficient and equally performant on clean data, are markedly less robust. We further confirm that physically realizable signal-space perturbations, designed to be feasible in real wireless channels, significantly reduce attack success compared to unconstrained feature-space attacks. Adversarial training mitigates these vulnerabilities, improving mean robust accuracy with only moderate degradation in clean performance across both model classes. As wireless sensing advances towards reliable, cross-domain operation, these findings provide quantitative baselines for robustness estimation and inform design principles for secure and trustworthy human-centered sensing systems.

### [195] [The Driver-Blindness Phenomenon: Why Deep Sequence Models Default to Autocorrelation in Blood Glucose Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20601)
*Heman Shakeri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 血糖预测模型存在'驱动因素盲区'问题，即无法有效利用胰岛素、饮食和活动等临床信息，导致多变量模型相比单变量基线几乎没有性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度序列模型在血糖预测中未能有效利用已知的生理驱动因素，尽管这些因素的作用机制已被充分理解。

Method: 提出Δ_drivers指标来衡量多变量模型相对于单变量基线的性能增益，并分析导致驱动因素盲区的三个因素：架构偏差、数据保真度差距和生理异质性。

Result: 文献综述显示Δ_drivers通常接近零，表明现有模型存在严重的驱动因素盲区问题。

Conclusion: 建议采用生理特征编码器、因果正则化和个性化等策略来缓解此问题，并建议未来工作常规报告Δ_drivers指标以避免驱动因素盲区模型被误认为最先进。

Abstract: Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting consistently fail to leverage clinically informative drivers--insulin, meals, and activity--despite well-understood physiological mechanisms. We term this Driver-Blindness and formalize it via $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$, the performance gain of multivariate models over matched univariate baselines. Across the literature, $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ is typically near zero. We attribute this to three interacting factors: architectural biases favoring autocorrelation (C1), data fidelity gaps that render drivers noisy and confounded (C2), and physiological heterogeneity that undermines population-level models (C3). We synthesize strategies that partially mitigate Driver-Blindness--including physiological feature encoders, causal regularization, and personalization--and recommend that future work routinely report $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ to prevent driver-blind models from being considered state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: LLM生成的代码在真实世界物流优化问题中表现不佳，人类编写的智能体在竞争中全面优于LLM生成的智能体，显示LLM在需要推理和战略规划的代码生成方面存在明显差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于强调单元测试通过率和语法正确性，低估了需要规划、优化和战略交互的真实世界问题的难度，需要开发更贴近实际应用的评估方法。

Method: 基于真实物流优化问题（拍卖、取货和配送问题）构建多智能体推理驱动基准，评估40个LLM生成的智能体与17个人类编写的智能体在12场双循环锦标赛中的表现。

Result: 人类编写的智能体包揽前5名，33个LLM智能体被简单基线击败，即使提供最佳人类解决方案，LLM也无法改进反而使其恶化。

Conclusion: LLM在生成具有竞争力的真实世界代码方面存在能力差距，需要开发强调推理驱动代码合成的新评估方法。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI-assisted code generation. This rapid development of LLMs has outpaced our ability to properly benchmark them. Prevailing benchmarks emphasize unit-test pass rates and syntactic correctness. Such metrics understate the difficulty of many real-world problems that require planning, optimization, and strategic interaction. We introduce a multi-agent reasoning-driven benchmark based on a real-world logistics optimization problem (Auction, Pickup, and Delivery Problem) that couples competitive auctions with capacity-constrained routing. The benchmark requires building agents that can (i) bid strategically under uncertainty and (ii) optimize planners that deliver tasks while maximizing profit. We evaluate 40 LLM-coded agents (by a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs under multiple prompting methodologies, including vibe coding) against 17 human-coded agents developed before the advent of LLMs. Our results over 12 double all-play-all tournaments and $\sim 40$k matches demonstrate (i) a clear superiority of human(graduate students)-coded agents: the top 5 spots are consistently won by human-coded agents, (ii) the majority of LLM-coded agents (33 out of 40) are beaten by very simple baselines, and (iii) given the best human solution as an input and prompted to improve upon, the best performing LLM makes the solution significantly worse instead of improving it. Our results highlight a gap in LLMs' ability to produce code that works competitively in the real-world, and motivate new evaluations that emphasize reasoning-driven code synthesis in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Token-DiFR是一种通过比较生成token与可信参考实现预测来验证LLM推理输出的方法，使用采样种子同步约束有效输出范围，能可靠检测采样错误、模拟bug和模型量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM推理需求增长，需要验证推理过程是否正确执行且未被篡改，但由于数值噪声导致重复运行相同推理会产生不同结果，难以区分合法变化与实际问题。

Method: Token-DiFR：通过可信参考实现使用相同随机种子进行预测，比较生成token；Activation-DiFR：使用随机正交投影压缩激活值为紧凑指纹进行验证。

Result: Token-DiFR在300个输出token内检测4位量化的AUC > 0.999；Activation-DiFR仅需2个输出token即可检测4位量化，AUC > 0.999，通信开销比现有方法减少25-75%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效验证LLM推理正确性，Token-DiFR以零额外成本提供可审计证据，Activation-DiFR实现高效前向传播验证，已开源集成vLLM加速实际部署。

Abstract: As demand for LLM inference grows, it is becoming increasingly important that providers and their customers can verify that inference processes are performed correctly, without errors or tampering. However, re-running the same inference process twice often leads to different results due to benign numerical noise, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate variation from actual problems. To address this problem, we introduce Token-DiFR (Token-Divergence-From-Reference), a method for verifying inference outputs by comparing generated tokens against predictions made by a trusted reference implementation conditioned on the same random seed. Sampling seed synchronization tightly constrains valid outputs, leaving providers minimal room to deviate from correct inference, which allows output tokens themselves to serve as auditable evidence of correctness at zero additional cost to the provider. Token-DiFR reliably identifies sampling errors, simulated bugs, and model quantization, detecting 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 within 300 output tokens. For applications requiring sample-efficient forward-pass verification, we additionally introduce Activation-DiFR, a scheme that uses random orthogonal projections to compress activations into compact fingerprints for subsequent verification. Activation-DiFR detects 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 using just 2 output tokens, while reducing communication overhead by 25-75% relative to existing methods. We release an open-source integration with vLLM to accelerate practical deployment of verifiable inference.

Motivation: 大型语言模型优化面临挑战，模型规模扩大加剧了对算法精度和训练稳定性的敏感性。现有基于动量正交化的优化器存在维度脆弱性和异常值噪声脆弱性两个关键鲁棒性限制。

Method: ROOT优化器采用双鲁棒机制：1) 使用自适应牛顿迭代和细粒度系数的维度鲁棒正交化方案；2) 通过近端优化的优化鲁棒框架抑制异常值噪声同时保留有意义的梯度方向。

Result: 大量实验表明，ROOT在鲁棒性方面显著改进，收敛速度更快，最终性能优于Muon和Adam基优化器，特别是在噪声和非凸场景中。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发能够处理现代大规模模型训练复杂性的鲁棒精确优化器建立了新范式。

Abstract: The optimization of large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, particularly as model scaling exacerbates sensitivity to algorithmic imprecision and training instability. Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for developing robust and precise optimizers capable of handling the complexities of modern large-scale model training. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/ROOT.

Motivation: 自适应优化器在非隐私训练中是标准选择，能实现更快收敛和更好性能，但差分隐私训练仍主要使用DP-SGD，需要大量计算和超参数调优。

Method: 开发DP-MicroAdam优化器，支持内存效率和稀疏性，在随机非凸优化中证明以最优速率收敛。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、大规模ImageNet训练和预训练transformer的私有微调等基准测试中，DP-MicroAdam优于现有自适应DP优化器，与DP-SGD竞争或表现更优。

Conclusion: 自适应优化在差分隐私下可以同时改善性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers are the de facto standard in non-private training as they often enable faster convergence and improved performance. In contrast, differentially private (DP) training is still predominantly performed with DP-SGD, typically requiring extensive compute and hyperparameter tuning. We propose DP-MicroAdam, a memory-efficient and sparsity-aware adaptive DP optimizer. We prove that DP-MicroAdam converges in stochastic non-convex optimization at the optimal $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate, up to privacy-dependent constants. Empirically, DP-MicroAdam outperforms existing adaptive DP optimizers and achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to DP-SGD across a range of benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, large-scale ImageNet training, and private fine-tuning of pretrained transformers. These results demonstrate that adaptive optimization can improve both performance and stability under differential privacy.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了Adam优化器中偏差校正组件的实际作用，发现在最优超参数配置下，偏差校正对最终测试性能没有改善，有时甚至有害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam优化器是现代深度学习的基石，但其各个组件的经验必要性常常被视为理所当然。本文旨在深入探究偏差校正这一特征的实际贡献，该组件的作用至今仍未被充分理解。

Method: 通过在视觉和语言建模任务上进行一系列系统性的消融实验，分析偏差校正在不同超参数配置下的表现，并重新解释偏差校正为一种隐式学习率调度机制。

Result: 实验表明，在最优超参数配置下，包含偏差校正不会改善最终测试性能。除非实施适当的学习率调度，否则偏差校正有时会对性能产生负面影响。偏差校正的行为强烈依赖于平滑超参数β₁、β₂的选择。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了偏差校正组件普遍适用的传统观念，表明该组件并非在所有情况下都是必要的。

Abstract: The Adam optimizer is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, yet the empirical necessity of each of its individual components is often taken for granted. This paper presents a focused investigation into the role of bias-correction, a feature whose contribution remains poorly understood. Through a series of systematic ablations on vision and language modelling tasks, we demonstrate that the conventional wisdom surrounding bias correction is misleading. In particular, we demonstrate that in the optimal hyper-parameter configuration, the inclusion of bias correction leads to no improvement in final test performance. Moreover, unless appropriate learning rate scheduling is implemented, the inclusion of bias correction can sometimes be detrimental to performance. We further reinterpret bias correction as a form of implicit learning rate scheduling whose behaviour is strongly dependent on the choice of smoothing hyper-parameters $β_1, β_2 \in [0,1)$. Our findings challenge the universal inclusion of this component.

TL;DR: UFNO-FiLM通过引入FiLM层解耦标量输入和空间特征，并使用空间加权损失函数，相比UFNO在预测精度上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UFNO在处理标量输入时效率低下，将其作为空间分布场处理，导致频域中出现冗余常数信号；同时标准损失函数未考虑误差敏感性的空间变化。

Method: 1. 使用FiLM层解耦标量输入和空间特征，避免常数信号进入傅里叶变换；2. 采用空间加权损失函数，优先学习关键区域。

Result: 在地下多相流实验中，相比UFNO，气体饱和度平均绝对误差(MAE)降低了21%。

Conclusion: UFNO-FiLM通过改进输入处理和损失函数，有效提升了预测精度，特别适用于物理重要性高的区域。

Abstract: The UNet-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) extends the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) by incorporating a parallel UNet pathway, enabling the retention of both high- and low-frequency components. While UFNO improves predictive accuracy over FNO, it inefficiently treats scalar inputs (e.g., temperature, injection rate) as spatially distributed fields by duplicating their values across the domain. This forces the model to process redundant constant signals within the frequency domain. Additionally, its standard loss function does not account for spatial variations in error sensitivity, limiting performance in regions of high physical importance. We introduce UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced architecture that incorporates two key innovations. First, we decouple scalar inputs from spatial features using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, allowing the model to modulate spatial feature maps without introducing constant signals into the Fourier transform. Second, we employ a spatially weighted loss function that prioritizes learning in critical regions. Our experiments on subsurface multiphase flow demonstrate a 21\% reduction in gas saturation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to UFNO, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in improving predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: E2E-GRec框架在多个推荐指标上显著优于传统方法，证明了端到端训练的有效性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.

TL;DR: MSTN是一个多尺度时间网络，通过层次化多尺度编码器、序列建模组件和门控融合机制，自适应建模从毫秒级到长期依赖的时间模式，在时间序列预测、插补和分类任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据高度非平稳且具有复杂的多时间尺度动态特性，现有基于固定尺度结构先验的模型容易过度正则化时间动态，限制了它们对全谱时间变化的自适应建模能力。

Method: 提出MSTN框架：1）多尺度卷积编码器构建层次特征金字塔；2）序列建模组件处理长期时间依赖；3）门控融合机制结合SE和多头时间注意力进行动态特征集成。

Result: 在32个基准数据集中的24个上建立了新的SOTA性能，在时间序列长期预测、插补、分类和泛化性研究中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSTN通过统一框架自适应建模多尺度时间模式，在多样化时间任务中展现出持续优异的性能，为时间序列分析提供了灵活的基础架构。

Abstract: Real-world time-series data is highly non stationary and complex in dynamics that operate across multiple timescales, ranging from fast, short-term changes to slow, long-term trends. Most existing models rely on fixed-scale structural priors, such as patch-based tokenization, fixed frequency transformations, or frozen backbone architectures. This often leads to over-regularization of temporal dynamics, which limits their ability to adaptively model the full spectrum of temporal variations and impairs their performance on unpredictable, Sudden, high-magnitude events. To address this, we introduce the Multi-scale Temporal Network (MSTN), a novel deep learning architecture founded on a hierarchical multi-scale and sequence modeling principle. The MSTN framework integrates: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that constructs a hierarchical feature pyramid for local patterns (ii) a sequence modeling component for long-range temporal dependencies. We empirically validate this with BiLSTM and Transformer variants, establishing a flexible foundation for future architectural advancements. and (iii) a gated fusion mechanism augmented with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) and multi-head temporal attention (MHTA) for dynamic, context-aware feature integration. This design enables MSTN to adaptively model temporal patterns from milliseconds to long-range dependencies within a unified framework. Extensive evaluations across time-series long-horizon forecasting, imputation, classification and generalizability study demonstrate that MSTN achieves competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, showing improvements over contemporary approaches including EMTSF, LLM4TS, HiMTM, TIME-LLM, MTST, SOFTS, iTransformer, TimesNet, and PatchTST. In total, MSTN establishes new SOTA performance on 24 of 32 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its consistent performance across diverse temporal tasks.

Motivation: 自适应优化器与归一化最速下降在仅适应当前梯度时会收敛到相同算法，但它们的分析依赖于不同的几何概念。研究旨在统一这两种算法家族的理论基础，并探索自适应优化器在非欧几里得几何下的加速潜力。

Result: 证明了自适应光滑性能够实现Nesterov动量加速，这是标准光滑性在特定非欧几里得几何下无法实现的；自适应梯度方差能够获得维度无关的收敛保证。

Conclusion: 自适应光滑性为自适应优化器提供了统一的理论框架，揭示了其在非欧几里得几何下的独特优势，包括加速可能性和维度无关的收敛性。

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers can reduce to normalized steepest descent (NSD) when only adapting to the current gradient, suggesting a close connection between the two algorithmic families. A key distinction between their analyses, however, lies in the geometries, e.g., smoothness notions, they rely on. In the convex setting, adaptive optimizers are governed by a stronger adaptive smoothness condition, while NSD relies on the standard notion of smoothness. We extend the theory of adaptive smoothness to the nonconvex setting and show that it precisely characterizes the convergence of adaptive optimizers. Moreover, we establish that adaptive smoothness enables acceleration of adaptive optimizers with Nesterov momentum in the convex setting, a guarantee unattainable under standard smoothness for certain non-Euclidean geometry. We further develop an analogous comparison for stochastic optimization by introducing adaptive gradient variance, which parallels adaptive smoothness and leads to dimension-free convergence guarantees that cannot be achieved under standard gradient variance for certain non-Euclidean geometry.

TL;DR: Anatomica是一个推理时框架，用于生成具有局部几何拓扑控制的多类解剖体素图。通过使用不同维度、位置和形状的控制域来切片相关子结构，并计算可微惩罚函数来引导样本满足目标约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够灵活控制解剖结构几何和拓扑特征的框架，用于合成数据集的理性设计，支持虚拟试验或机器学习工作流程。

Method: 使用立方体控制域切片子结构，通过体素矩控制几何特征（大小、形状、位置），通过持久同调控制拓扑特征（连通分量、环、空洞），在潜在扩散模型中实现神经场解码器部分提取子结构。

Result: Anatomica能够灵活应用于不同解剖系统，在任意维度和坐标系下组合约束来控制复杂结构。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了对解剖体素图的精确几何和拓扑控制，为合成数据集的理性设计提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present Anatomica: an inference-time framework for generating multi-class anatomical voxel maps with localized geo-topological control. During generation, we use cuboidal control domains of varying dimensionality, location, and shape to slice out relevant substructures. These local substructures are used to compute differentiable penalty functions that steer the sample towards target constraints. We control geometric features such as size, shape, and position through voxel-wise moments, while topological features such as connected components, loops, and voids are enforced through persistent homology. Lastly, we implement Anatomica for latent diffusion models, where neural field decoders partially extract substructures, enabling the efficient control of anatomical properties. Anatomica applies flexibly across diverse anatomical systems, composing constraints to control complex structures over arbitrary dimensions and coordinate systems, thereby enabling the rational design of synthetic datasets for virtual trials or machine learning workflows.

TL;DR: 提出注意力导向指标(ATOMs)来研究强化学习代理在训练过程中注意力发展，通过三个Pong游戏变体实验验证了ATOMs能区分不同注意力模式并揭示注意力发展的阶段性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习代理的学习过程除了数学公式外仍缺乏深入理解，需要研究其注意力发展机制。

Method: 引入ATOMs指标，在三个设计不同的Pong游戏变体上进行实验，结合行为评估分析代理的注意力模式。

Result: ATOMs成功区分了不同游戏变体中代理的注意力模式，这些差异转化为行为差异；训练过程中观察到注意力发展的阶段性特征，且在不同游戏变体中具有一致性。

Conclusion: ATOMs有助于提高对强化学习代理学习过程的理解，更好地理解注意力与学习之间的关系。

Abstract: The learning process of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent remains poorly understood beyond the mathematical formulation of its learning algorithm. To address this gap, we introduce attention-oriented metrics (ATOMs) to investigate the development of an RL agent's attention during training. In a controlled experiment, we tested ATOMs on three variations of a Pong game, each designed to teach the agent distinct behaviours, complemented by a behavioural assessment. ATOMs successfully delineate the attention patterns of an agent trained on each game variation, and that these differences in attention patterns translate into differences in the agent's behaviour. Through continuous monitoring of ATOMs during training, we observed that the agent's attention developed in phases, and that these phases were consistent across game variations. Overall, we believe that ATOM could help improve our understanding of the learning processes of RL agents and better understand the relationship between attention and learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型反转技术主要关注数据域扩散模型，而忽略了潜在空间生成模型（如LDMs）中编码器/解码器对和潜在代码的作用。本文旨在研究潜在扩散模型中的记忆化特性及其隐私风险。

Method: 提出了一种原则性方法来按解码器回拉度量对潜在维度进行排序，识别对记忆化贡献最大的维度，并在计算基于分数的成员推理攻击统计量时移除较少记忆化的维度。

Result: 实验表明该方法在CIFAR-10、CelebA、ImageNet-1K等多个数据集上显著提升了成员推理攻击性能，平均AUROC增益达2.7%，TPR@1%FPR提升6.42%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自编码器几何结构对LDM记忆化的被忽视影响，为分析基于扩散的生成模型的隐私风险提供了新视角。

Abstract: The recovery of training data from generative models (``model inversion'') has been extensively studied for diffusion models in the data domain. The encoder/decoder pair and corresponding latent codes have largely been ignored by inversion techniques applied to latent space generative models, e.g., Latent Diffusion models (LDMs). In this work we describe two key findings: (1) The diffusion model exhibits non-uniform memorization across latent codes, tending to overfit samples located in high-distortion regions of the decoder pullback metric. (2) Even within a single latent code, different dimensions contribute unequally to memorization. We introduce a principled method to rank latent dimensions by their per-dimensional contribution to the decoder pullback metric, identifying those most responsible for memorization. Empirically, removing less-memorizing dimensions when computing attack statistics for score-based membership inference attacker significantly improves performance, with average AUROC gains of 2.7\% and substantial increases in TPR@1\%FPR (6.42\%) across diverse datasets including CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet-1K, Pokémon, MS-COCO, and Flickr. This indicates stronger confidence in identifying members under extremely low false-positive tolerance. Our results highlight the overlooked influence of the auto-encoder geometry on LDM memorization and provide a new perspective for analyzing privacy risks in diffusion-based generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关联记忆模型基于邻近性评估检索质量，无法保证检索到的模式与查询具有最强关联，缺乏正确性保证。

Method: 提出变体分布建模查询生成过程，开发自适应相似度机制来近似存储模式生成查询的可能性，并将其集成到自适应Hopfield网络（A-Hop）中。

Result: 理论证明自适应相似度在噪声、掩码和偏置三种典型变体下实现最优正确检索，实验结果显示在记忆检索、表格分类、图像分类和多实例学习等任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过重新定义关联记忆的正确性标准并开发自适应相似度机制，实现了更可靠和有效的关联记忆系统。

Abstract: Associative memory models are content-addressable memory systems fundamental to biological intelligence and are notable for their high interpretability. However, existing models evaluate the quality of retrieval based on proximity, which cannot guarantee that the retrieved pattern has the strongest association with the query, failing correctness. We reframe this problem by proposing that a query is a generative variant of a stored memory pattern, and define a variant distribution to model this subtle context-dependent generative process. Consequently, correct retrieval should return the memory pattern with the maximum a posteriori probability of being the query's origin. This perspective reveals that an ideal similarity measure should approximate the likelihood of each stored pattern generating the query in accordance with variant distribution, which is impossible for fixed and pre-defined similarities used by existing associative memories. To this end, we develop adaptive similarity, a novel mechanism that learns to approximate this insightful but unknown likelihood from samples drawn from context, aiming for correct retrieval. We theoretically prove that our proposed adaptive similarity achieves optimal correct retrieval under three canonical and widely applicable types of variants: noisy, masked, and biased. We integrate this mechanism into a novel adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop), and empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including memory retrieval, tabular classification, image classification, and multiple instance learning.

TL;DR: Image2Gcode是一个端到端的数据驱动框架，直接从图像和零件图纸生成打印机就绪的G代码，绕过了传统的CAD建模阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机械设计和制造流程依赖CAD建模，这成为快速原型制作的主要瓶颈。即使微小的设计变更也需要在CAD软件中手动更新，使得迭代耗时且难以扩展。

Method: 使用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)在G代码序列上进行操作，从高斯噪声通过迭代去噪转换为可执行的打印移动轨迹和挤出参数，建立从视觉输入到原生刀具路径的直接映射。

Result: 框架能够直接从2D图像生成结构化G代码，无需CAD或STL中间文件，降低了增材制造的门槛，加速了从设计到制造的周期。

Conclusion: Image2Gcode提供了一个灵活、计算效率高的框架，推进了设计迭代、修复工作流程和分布式制造的可访问性。

Abstract: Mechanical design and manufacturing workflows conventionally begin with conceptual design, followed by the creation of a computer-aided design (CAD) model and fabrication through material-extrusion (MEX) printing. This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact. The result is a flexible, computationally efficient framework that advances accessibility in design iteration, repair workflows, and distributed manufacturing.

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用可穿戴设备和AI方法预测慢性疼痛和阿片类药物使用障碍患者的疼痛发作，发现机器学习模型预测准确率较高，但大语言模型在此场景下表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疼痛(CP)和阿片类药物使用障碍(OUD)是相互关联的常见慢性疾病，目前缺乏针对接受MOUD治疗患者的循证整合治疗方案。可穿戴设备有潜力监测复杂患者信息，但LLMs在此领域的应用尚未探索。

Method: 使用可穿戴设备监测患者数据，采用多种AI方法（包括机器学习模型和LLMs）分析疼痛发作的临床相关性。

Result: 机器学习模型在预测疼痛发作方面达到相对较高的准确率(>0.7)，而LLMs在提供疼痛发作见解方面表现有限。

Conclusion: 可穿戴设备的实时监测结合先进AI模型可促进疼痛发作的早期检测，支持个性化干预。鉴于LLMs整体表现有限，需要开发能够在此背景下提供可操作见解的LLMs。

Abstract: Chronic pain (CP) and opioid use disorder (OUD) are common and interrelated chronic medical conditions. Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care. Given overall limited LLM performance, these findings highlight the need to develop LLMs which can provide actionable insights in the OUD/CP context.

Motivation: 计算机使用代理（CUAs）的发展受到缺乏大规模高质量人类与计算机交互数据集的限制。虽然LLMs在丰富的文本数据上蓬勃发展，但没有类似的数据集用于CUA轨迹。

Method: 开发FaraGen系统，从常用网站生成多样化任务，产生多个解决方案尝试，并使用多个验证器过滤成功轨迹。使用这些数据训练Fara-7B模型，该模型仅通过截图感知计算机，通过预测坐标执行动作，并且足够小以在设备上运行。

Result: Fara-7B在WebVoyager、Online-Mind2Web和WebTailBench等基准测试中优于其他同等规模的CUA模型，并且与更大的前沿模型具有竞争力。FaraGen系统以每个约1美元的成本产生经过验证的轨迹。

Conclusion: 可扩展的数据生成系统在推进小型高效代理模型方面具有关键优势。Fara-7B作为开源模型发布，同时发布了WebTailBench基准测试。

Abstract: Progress in computer use agents (CUAs) has been constrained by the absence of large and high-quality datasets that capture how humans interact with a computer. While LLMs have thrived on abundant textual data, no comparable corpus exists for CUA trajectories. To address these gaps, we introduce FaraGen, a novel synthetic data generation system for multi-step web tasks. FaraGen can propose diverse tasks from frequently used websites, generate multiple solution attempts, and filter successful trajectories using multiple verifiers. It achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity for multi-step web tasks, producing verified trajectories at approximately $1 each. We use this data to train Fara-7B, a native CUA model that perceives the computer using only screenshots, executes actions via predicted coordinates, and is small enough to run on-device. We find that Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks like WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench -- our novel benchmark that better captures under-represented web tasks in pre-existing benchmarks. Furthermore, Fara-7B is competitive with much larger frontier models, illustrating key benefits of scalable data generation systems in advancing small efficient agentic models. We are making Fara-7B open-weight on Microsoft Foundry and HuggingFace, and we are releasing WebTailBench.

Method: 提出FISCAL框架生成金融合成数据，并训练MiniCheck-FISCAL轻量级验证器，专注于数值金融声明的验证。

Result: MiniCheck-FISCAL在多个金融数据集上表现优异，超越GPT-3.5 Turbo和类似规模的开源模型，接近Mixtral-8x22B等大20倍模型的准确性，在外部数据集上与GPT-4o和Claude-3.5相媲美。

Abstract: Financial applications of large language models (LLMs) require factual reliability and computational efficiency, yet current systems often hallucinate details and depend on prohibitively large models. We propose FISCAL (Financial Synthetic Claim-Document Augmented Learning), a modular framework for generating synthetic data tailored to financial fact-checking. Using FISCAL, we generate a dataset called FISCAL-data and use it to train MiniCheck-FISCAL, a lightweight verifier for numerical financial claims. MiniCheck-FISCAL outperforms its baseline, surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo and other open-source peers of similar size, and approaches the accuracy of much larger systems (20x), such as Mixtral-8x22B and Command R+. On external datasets FinDVer and Fin-Fact, it rivals GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 while outperforming Gemini-1.5 Flash. These results show that domain-specific synthetic data, combined with efficient fine-tuning, enables compact models to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness, and scalability for practical financial AI. The dataset and scripts are available in the project repository (link provided in the paper).

TL;DR: LLMs can accelerate educational assessment item alignment reviews while maintaining high accuracy, particularly when using candidate filtering strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially for large item banks. Need scalable solutions to maintain assessment fairness and instructional relevance.

Method: Tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o) on 12,000+ K-5 item-skill pairs across three tasks: identifying misalignments, selecting correct skills from standards, and candidate list filtering.

Result: GPT-4o-mini achieved 83-94% accuracy in identifying alignment status, strong math performance but lower reading performance due to semantic overlap, and candidate filtering improved correct skill identification to >95% in top 5 suggestions.

Conclusion: LLMs with candidate filtering can significantly reduce manual review burden while preserving accuracy. Recommend hybrid pipelines combining LLM screening with human review for ambiguous cases.

Abstract: As educational systems evolve, ensuring that assessment items remain aligned with content standards is essential for maintaining fairness and instructional relevance. Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy. We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment.

Conclusion: VISTA-Gym是解锁视觉语言模型工具集成推理能力的有效训练平台，显著提升了模型的视觉推理性能。

Abstract: While recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong image understanding, their ability to "think with images", i.e., to reason through multi-step visual interactions, remains limited. We introduce VISTA-Gym, a scalable training environment for incentivizing tool-integrated visual reasoning capabilities in VLMs. VISTA-Gym unifies diverse real-world multimodal reasoning tasks (7 tasks from 13 datasets in total) with a standardized interface for visual tools (e.g., grounding, parsing), executable interaction loops, verifiable feedback signals, and efficient trajectory logging, enabling visual agentic reinforcement learning at scale. While recent VLMs exhibit strong text-only reasoning, both proprietary and open-source models still struggle with tool selection, invocation, and coordination. With VISTA-Gym, we train VISTA-R1 to interleave tool-use with agentic reasoning via multi-turn trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across 11 public reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks show that VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with similar sizes by 9.51%-18.72%, demonstrating VISTA-Gym as an effective training ground to unlock the tool-integrated reasoning capabilities for VLMs.

Abstract: We introduce a neuro-symbolic framework for multi-intent understanding in mobile AI agents by integrating a structured intent ontology with compact language models. Our method leverages retrieval-augmented prompting, logit biasing and optional classification heads to inject symbolic intent structure into both input and output representations. We formalize a new evaluation metric-Semantic Intent Similarity (SIS)-based on hierarchical ontology depth, capturing semantic proximity even when predicted intents differ lexically. Experiments on a subset of ambiguous/demanding dialogues of MultiWOZ 2.3 (with oracle labels from GPT-o3) demonstrate that a 3B Llama model with ontology augmentation approaches GPT-4 accuracy (85% vs 90%) at a tiny fraction of the energy and memory footprint. Qualitative comparisons show that ontology-augmented models produce more grounded, disambiguated multi-intent interpretations. Our results validate symbolic alignment as an effective strategy for enabling accurate and efficient on-device NLU.

Conclusion: KOM可促进膝骨关节炎自动化管理，整合到临床工作流程中有潜力提升护理效率，其模块化架构对其他慢性病AI辅助系统开发具有参考价值

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) affects more than 600 million individuals globally and is associated with significant pain, functional impairment, and disability. While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency.

### [219] [A Unified Evaluation-Instructed Framework for Query-Dependent Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19829)
*Ke Chen,Yifeng Wang,Hassan Almosapeeh,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于评估指导的提示优化方法，通过建立系统化的提示评估框架和执行无关的评估器，实现可解释的查询相关提示优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法大多使用静态模板，在复杂动态场景中效果有限；查询相关方法依赖不稳定文本反馈或黑盒奖励模型，优化信号弱且不可解释；提示质量缺乏统一系统定义导致评估信号碎片化。

Method: 建立性能导向的系统化提示评估框架，开发并微调执行无关的评估器预测多维质量分数，评估器指导度量感知优化器诊断失败模式并以可解释方式重写提示。

Result: 评估器在预测提示性能方面达到最高准确率，评估指导的优化在8个数据集和3个骨干模型上持续超越静态模板和查询相关基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出了统一的度量基础提示质量视角，证明评估指导的优化管道能在多样化任务中提供稳定、可解释和模型无关的改进。

Abstract: Most prompt-optimization methods refine a single static template, making them ineffective in complex and dynamic user scenarios. Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models. Overall, we propose a unified, metric-grounded perspective on prompt quality, and demonstrated that our evaluation-instructed optimization pipeline delivers stable, interpretable, and model-agnostic improvements across diverse tasks.

### [220] [Reinforcement Learning with $ω$-Regular Objectives and Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19849)
*Dominik Wagner,Leon Witzman,Luke Ong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合ω-正则目标和显式约束的强化学习方法，解决了传统标量奖励表达能力有限和安全性-性能权衡的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习依赖标量奖励，表达能力有限且容易导致奖励黑客行为。ω-正则目标能表达更丰富的行为特性，但单一标量度量掩盖了安全性-性能的权衡。

Method: 开发了基于线性规划的模型强化学习算法，将安全要求和优化目标分开处理，确保在满足ω-正则约束阈值的同时最大化目标满足概率。

Result: 算法在极限情况下能产生满足ω-正则约束阈值并最大化目标概率的策略，并建立了到约束极限平均问题的最优保持转换。

Conclusion: 该方法同时解决了强化学习中目标表达能力和安全性-性能权衡的局限性，为复杂环境下的安全强化学习提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) commonly relies on scalar rewards with limited ability to express temporal, conditional, or safety-critical goals, and can lead to reward hacking. Temporal logic expressible via the more general class of $ω$-regular objectives addresses this by precisely specifying rich behavioural properties. Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.
  We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $ω$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $ω$-regular objective while also adhering to $ω$-regular constraints within specified thresholds. Furthermore, we establish a translation to constrained limit-average problems with optimality-preserving guarantees.

Abstract: Educational simulations have long been recognized as powerful tools for enhancing learning outcomes, yet their creation has traditionally required substantial resources and technical expertise. This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\% compared to traditional instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand. We discuss implementation considerations, present evidence of effectiveness, and outline future directions for AI-powered adaptive learning systems built on the MicroSim foundation.

Abstract: In the 6G era, semantic collaboration among multiple embodied intelligent devices (MEIDs) becomes crucial for complex task execution. However, existing systems face challenges in multimodal information fusion, adaptive communication, and decision interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a collaborative Conversational Embodied Intelligence Network (CC-EIN) integrating multimodal feature fusion, adaptive semantic communication, task coordination, and interpretability. PerceptiNet performs cross-modal fusion of image and radar data to generate unified semantic representations. An adaptive semantic communication strategy dynamically adjusts coding schemes and transmission power according to task urgency and channel quality. A semantic-driven collaboration mechanism further supports task decomposition and conflict-free coordination among heterogeneous devices. Finally, the InDec module enhances decision transparency through Grad-CAM visualization. Simulation results in post-earthquake rescue scenarios demonstrate that CC-EIN achieves 95.4% task completion rate and 95% transmission efficiency while maintaining strong semantic consistency and energy efficiency.

*Daniel I Jackson,Emma L Jensen,Syed-Amad Hussain,Emre Sezgin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在自我效能感评估中表现出与人类不同的模式，自我评估不能可靠反映实际能力，高自信模型更倾向于拟人化推理风格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型的自我评估能力，了解其自我效能感是否与实际表现相关，以及不同任务条件下的自我认知变化。

Method: 使用10项通用自我效能感量表(GSES)在四种条件下测试十个LLM：无任务、计算推理、社交推理和摘要任务，分析响应稳定性和自我评估准确性。

Result: LLMs的自我效能感得分低于人类标准，所有模型在计算和社交任务中准确率100%，但摘要任务表现差异大。自我评估与实际能力不相关，高自信模型摘要质量反而较差。

Conclusion: 心理测量提示能提供LLM沟通行为的结构化洞察，但不能提供校准的性能估计，自我评估不能作为可靠的能力指标。

Abstract: Self-assessment is a key aspect of reliable intelligence, yet evaluations of large language models (LLMs) focus mainly on task accuracy. We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries. Follow-up confidence prompts yielded modest, mostly downward revisions, suggesting mild overestimation in first-pass assessments. Qualitative analysis showed that higher self-efficacy corresponded to more assertive, anthropomorphic reasoning styles, whereas lower scores reflected cautious, de-anthropomorphized explanations. Psychometric prompting provides structured insight into LLM communication behavior but not calibrated performance estimates.

Conclusion: RPM-MCTS是一种有效的代码生成方法，通过知识检索和沙箱反馈机制解决了中间步骤评估和错误定位问题，在性能和效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Tree search-based methods have made significant progress in enhancing the code generation capabilities of large language models. However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption. Furthermore, full fine-tuning of the base model using the data constructed by RPM-MCTS significantly enhances its code capabilities.

Conclusion: 提出的基于知识图谱的基准生成方法有效解决了现有基准的局限性，揭示了语义相似性评估的复杂性，为LLM输出语义评估提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the open-form textual responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) typically requires measuring the semantic similarity of the response to a (human generated) reference. However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型正被快速集成到决策支持工具和自动化工作流中，但其在生产环境中的行为仍未被充分理解，且故障模式与传统机器学习模型有根本性差异。

Method: 提出了一个系统级的故障模式分类法，包括多步推理漂移、潜在不一致性、上下文边界退化、错误工具调用、版本漂移和成本驱动的性能崩溃等15种模式。

Result: 分析了评估与监控实践中的差距，现有基准测试主要测量知识和推理能力，但对稳定性、可重复性、漂移和工作流集成提供的信息有限。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM可靠性视为系统工程问题而非纯模型中心问题，为未来关于评估方法、AI系统鲁棒性和可靠LLM部署的研究提供了分析基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being rapidly integrated into decision-support tools, automation workflows, and AI-enabled software systems. However, their behavior in production environments remains poorly understood, and their failure patterns differ fundamentally from those of traditional machine learning models. This paper presents a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes that arise in real-world LLM applications, including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems. By framing LLM reliability as a system-engineering problem rather than a purely model-centric one, this work provides an analytical foundation for future research on evaluation methodology, AI system robustness, and dependable LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了M³Prune框架，通过层次化通信图剪枝减少多模态多智能体系统中的冗余边，在保持性能的同时显著降低token开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统虽然性能优秀，但存在显著的token开销和计算成本问题，难以大规模部署。

Method: 采用层次化通信图剪枝：首先进行模态内图稀疏化识别关键边，然后构建动态通信拓扑进行模态间图稀疏化，最后渐进式剪枝冗余边。

Result: 在通用和领域特定的mRAG基准测试中，该方法在显著减少token消耗的同时，性能优于单智能体和鲁棒多智能体系统。

Conclusion: M³Prune框架能够在任务性能和token开销之间实现最佳平衡，为多模态多智能体系统的大规模部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (mRAG), which enhance multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with external knowledge, have demonstrated that the collective intelligence of multiple agents can significantly outperform a single model through effective communication. Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology. Extensive experiments on both general and domain-specific mRAG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single-agent and robust multi-agent mRAG systems while significantly reducing token consumption.

TL;DR: SPAgent通过算法-系统协同设计框架，采用两阶段自适应推测机制和两级调度器，显著降低基于LLM的搜索代理的延迟，实现最高1.65倍的端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的搜索代理性能强大但延迟严重，因为每个步骤都需要串行化的LLM推理和工具执行。传统推测范式虽然能打破串行执行，但收益有限，因为它保留了完整的工作负载并增加了额外的推理开销。

Method: SPAgent采用算法-系统协同设计：算法层面引入两阶段自适应推测机制，在安全时选择性省略验证；系统层面使用两级调度器根据引擎负载调节推测请求，确保推测保持有益。

Result: 在广泛的实验设置中，SPAgent实现了最高1.65倍的端到端加速，同时保持相同甚至更高的准确性，使多步骤搜索代理的实际部署成为可能。

Conclusion: SPAgent通过扩展推测在搜索代理中的作用，有效降低了延迟，为多步骤搜索代理的实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based search agents achieve strong performance but suffer from severe latency, as each step requires serialized LLM reasoning followed by action of tool execution. We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems. Across extensive experimental settings, SPAgent achieves up to $1.65\times$ end-to-end speedup while maintaining same or even achieving higher accuracy, enabling practical deployment of multi-step search agents.

Result: 框架在任务成功检测中达到73%的准确率，应用评估器反馈后整体任务成功率平均相对提高27%。

Conclusion: 基于视觉的评估可以作为有效的反馈机制，显著提升自主计算机使用代理的可靠性和自我修正能力。

Abstract: Computer Use Agents (CUAs) are designed to autonomously operate digital interfaces, yet they often fail to reliably determine whether a given task has been completed. We present an autonomous evaluation and feedback framework that uses vision-language models to assess task completion directly from screenshots and task descriptions. Our dataset covers 42 built-in macOS applications and 1,260 human-labeled tasks across a wide range of scenarios. Our framework achieves up to 73 percent accuracy in task success detection and yields an average relative improvement of 27 percent in overall task success when evaluator feedback is applied. These results show that vision-based evaluation can serve as an effective feedback mechanism that improves the reliability and self-correction of autonomous computer-use agents.

Abstract: The current remote sensing image analysis task is increasingly evolving from traditional object recognition to complex intelligence reasoning, which places higher requirements on the model's reasoning ability and the flexibility of tool invocation. To this end, we propose a new multimodal agent framework, Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework (VICoT), which implements explicit multi-round reasoning by dynamically incorporating visual tools into the chain of thought. Through a stack-based reasoning structure and a modular MCP-compatible tool suite, VICoT enables LLMs to efficiently perform multi-round, interleaved vision-language reasoning tasks with strong generalization and flexibility.We also propose the Reasoning Stack distillation method to migrate complex Agent behaviors to small, lightweight models, which ensures the reasoning capability while significantly reducing complexity. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that VICoT significantly outperforms existing SOTA frameworks in reasoning transparency, execution efficiency, and generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法在移除多模态大语言模型中的隐私敏感信息时，会损害模型的通用图像理解性能，需要一种既能精确遗忘目标信息又能保持整体能力的方法。

Method: SMFA首先微调模型将敏感响应替换为拒绝回答，生成记忆遗忘适配器，然后应用保留锚点引导的掩码机制来防止对无关知识和理解能力的干扰。

Result: 大量实验表明，与现有方法不同，SMFA能够实现精确可控的遗忘，同时保持模型的基础图像理解能力。

Conclusion: SMFA方法成功解决了多模态大语言模型隐私敏感信息遗忘问题，在精确移除目标知识的同时有效保护了模型的通用视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve remarkable capabilities but can inadvertently memorize privacy-sensitive information. Although existing unlearning methods can remove such knowledge, they fail to achieve benign forgetting because they often degrade the model's general image understanding performance. To address this, we propose the Sculpted Memory Forgetting Adapter (SMFA), which confines forgetting to targeted memory regions while preserving overall capabilities. SMFA first fine-tunes the model to replace sensitive responses with refusals, yielding a memory forgetting adapter, and then applies a retaining anchor-guided masking mechanism to prevent interference with unrelated knowledge and understanding ability. To systematically evaluate selective MLLM unlearning, we introduce S-MLLMUn Bench, the first benchmark designed to jointly assess the removal of sensitive knowledge and retention of general visual understanding. Extensive experiments show that, unlike prior methods, SMFA achieves precise and controllable unlearning while maintaining the model's foundational image understanding.

Abstract: This report presents the solution and results of our team MSRA\_SC in the Commonsense Persona-Grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC 2025). We propose a simple yet effective framework that unifies improvements across both GPU Track and API Track. Our method centers on two key components. First, Context Engineering applies dynamic tool pruning and persona clipping for input compression, combined with post-processing techniques such as parameter normalization and function merging. Together with manually refined prompts, this design improves tool call stability, execution reliability, and role-playing guidance. Second, in the GPU Track, we further adopt GRPO training, replacing supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning directly optimized by reward signals. This mitigates small-sample overfitting and significantly enhances task-oriented dialogue performance.

TL;DR: CostNav是首个将导航性能与商业可行性相结合的经济测试平台，通过成本收益分析评估自主送货机器人的经济可行性，揭示导航研究指标与商业部署之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航基准只关注任务成功率，忽视了商业部署所需的经济可行性。自主送货机器人的商业化需要综合考虑成本收益分析。

Method: CostNav建立完整的成本收益模型，包括硬件、训练、能源、维护成本和送货收入，使用行业参数，通过缩小尺度模拟投影到实际送货场景。

Result: 基准模型达到43.0%的服务水平协议合规率，但不可行：每次运行亏损30.009美元，无盈亏平衡点，99.7%的运行成本来自碰撞导致的维护费用。

Conclusion: CostNav填补了导航研究与商业部署之间的差距，为基于规则的导航、模仿学习和成本感知强化学习训练提供了评估基础，使导航范式的经济权衡能够基于数据做出决策。

Abstract: Existing navigation benchmarks focus on task success metrics while overlooking economic viability -- critical for commercial deployment of autonomous delivery robots. We introduce \emph{CostNav}, a \textbf{Micro-Navigation Economic Testbed} that evaluates embodied agents through comprehensive cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters. \textbf{To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability}, revealing that optimizing for task success fundamentally differs from optimizing for economic deployment. Our cost model uses parameters derived from industry data sources (energy rates, delivery service pricing), and we project from a reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries. Under this projection, the baseline achieves 43.0\% SLA compliance but is \emph{not} commercially viable: yielding a loss of \$30.009 per run with no finite break-even point, because operating costs are dominated by collision-induced maintenance, which accounts for 99.7\% of per-run costs and highlights collision avoidance as a key optimization target. We demonstrate a learning-based on-device navigation baseline and establish a foundation for evaluating rule-based navigation, imitation learning, and cost-aware RL training. CostNav bridges the gap between navigation research and commercial deployment, enabling data-driven decisions about economic trade-offs across navigation paradigms.

TL;DR: 提出DANCE方法，通过整合特征依赖关系和因果约束来生成多样、可行、知识约束的反事实解释，确保反事实的合理性和现实可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法往往忽略现实数据集中的复杂依赖关系，导致不现实或不实用的修改。受网络安全和电子邮件营销应用启发，需要确保反事实的合理性和现实可行性。

Method: DANCE方法从数据中学习线性和非线性约束，或整合专家提供的依赖图，保持特征关系一致性，平衡合理性、多样性和稀疏性。

Result: 在140个公共数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法能够生成有意义、领域相关的反事实，在广泛使用的指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DANCE方法通过整合特征依赖和因果约束，有效解决了现有算法的关键局限性，生成了合理且可行的反事实解释。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations enhance the actionable interpretability of machine learning models by identifying the minimal changes required to achieve a desired outcome of the model. However, existing methods often ignore the complex dependencies in real-world datasets, leading to unrealistic or impractical modifications. Motivated by cybersecurity applications in the email marketing domain, we propose a method for generating Diverse, Actionable, and kNowledge-Constrained Explanations (DANCE), which incorporates feature dependencies and causal constraints to ensure plausibility and real-world feasibility of counterfactuals. Our method learns linear and nonlinear constraints from data or integrates expert-provided dependency graphs, ensuring counterfactuals are plausible and actionable. By maintaining consistency with feature relationships, the method produces explanations that align with real-world constraints. Additionally, it balances plausibility, diversity, and sparsity, effectively addressing key limitations in existing algorithms. The work is developed based on a real-life case study with Freshmail, the largest email marketing company in Poland and supported by a joint R&D project Sendguard. Furthermore, we provide an extensive evaluation using 140 public datasets, which highlights its ability to generate meaningful, domain-relevant counterfactuals that outperform other existing approaches based on widely used metrics. The source code for reproduction of the results can be found in a GitHub repository we provide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗领域架构匹配中，大语言模型存在幻觉问题和缺乏最新领域知识，而现有知识图谱增强方法依赖低效的多跳查询或存储密集的向量检索方法。

Method: SMoG框架采用迭代执行简单1跳SPARQL查询的策略，直接从SPARQL端点查询，生成可人工验证的查询路径。

Result: 在真实医疗数据集上的实验结果表明，SMoG达到了与最先进基线方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: SMoG验证了在知识图谱增强架构匹配中的有效性和效率，为医疗数据集成提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Schema matching is a critical task in data integration, particularly in the medical domain where disparate Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems must be aligned to standard models like OMOP CDM. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in schema matching, they suffer from hallucination and lack of up-to-date domain knowledge. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution by providing structured, verifiable knowledge. However, existing KG-augmented LLM approaches often rely on inefficient complex multi-hop queries or storage-intensive vector-based retrieval methods. This paper introduces SMoG (Schema Matching on Graph), a novel framework that leverages iterative execution of simple 1-hop SPARQL queries, inspired by successful strategies in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). SMoG enhances explainability and reliability by generating human-verifiable query paths while significantly reducing storage requirements by directly querying SPARQL endpoints. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that SMoG achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness and efficiency in KG-augmented schema matching.

Conclusion: 将知识库作为模块化、可控的优化基板，为智能体行为提供透明、可解释和可扩展的优化方式

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly applied to tasks requiring structured reasoning, tool use, and environmental adaptation, such as data manipulation, multistep planning, and computer-use automation. However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $τ^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models. Unlike prior work where memory is treated as static context, we establish the KB as a modular and controllable substrate for agent optimization -- an explicit lever for shaping behavior in a transparent, interpretable, and extensible manner.

Result: 新增强技术扩展了可恢复网络大小的最先进范围，能够恢复参数数量比训练数据点多100倍的网络。

Conclusion: 专门设计的增强技术比标准增强方法更有效地采样网络表示空间，显著提升了网络参数逆向工程的能力。

Abstract: Network weights can be reverse-engineered given enough informative samples of a network's input-output function. In a teacher-student setup, this translates into collecting a dataset of the teacher mapping -- querying the teacher -- and fitting a student to imitate such mapping. A sensible choice of queries is the dataset the teacher is trained on. But current methods fail when the teacher parameters are more numerous than the training data, because the student overfits to the queries instead of aligning its parameters to the teacher. In this work, we explore augmentation techniques to best sample the input-output mapping of a teacher network, with the goal of eliciting a rich set of representations from the teacher hidden layers. We discover that standard augmentations such as rotation, flipping, and adding noise, bring little to no improvement to the identification problem. We design new data augmentation techniques tailored to better sample the representational space of the network's hidden layers. With our augmentations we extend the state-of-the-art range of recoverable network sizes. To test their scalability, we show that we can recover networks of up to 100 times more parameters than training data-points.

Motivation: 澄清主动推理概念，将其与自由能原理分离开来，展示主动推理在离散状态空间中的实现可以不依赖期望自由能。

Method: 将主动推理的优化问题表述为约束散度最小化问题，使用标准平均场方法求解，提出的感知/行动散度准则在建模感知时与变分自由能一致，在建模行动时与期望自由能泛函相差一个熵正则项。

Result: 成功展示了主动推理可以在不依赖期望自由能概念的情况下实现，提出的散度最小化方法为主动推理提供了替代实现途径。

Conclusion: 主动推理可以与自由能原理分离，通过约束散度最小化方法实现，这为理解和使用主动推理提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: We seek to clarify the concept of active inference by disentangling it from the Free Energy Principle. We show how the optimizations that need to be carried out in order to implement active inference in discrete state spaces can be formulated as constrained divergence minimization problems which can be solved by standard mean field methods that do not appeal to the idea of expected free energy. When it is used to model perception, the perception/action divergence criterion that we propose coincides with variational free energy. When it is used to model action, it differs from an expected free energy functional by an entropy regularizer.

Abstract: Building self-improving AI systems remains a fundamental challenge in the AI domain. We present NNGPT, an open-source framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, primarily for computer vision. Unlike previous frameworks, NNGPT extends the dataset of neural networks by generating new models, enabling continuous fine-tuning of LLMs based on closed-loop system of generation, assessment, and self-improvement. It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78. The system has already generated over 5K validated models, proving NNGPT as an autonomous AutoML engine. Upon acceptance, the code, prompts, and checkpoints will be released for public access to enable reproducibility and facilitate community usage.

Conclusion: VibraVerse为物理一致性和因果可解释的多模态学习建立了基准，为声音引导的具身感知和物理世界理解提供了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the physical world requires perceptual models grounded in physical laws rather than mere statistical correlations. However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in multi-step reasoning and problem-solving.Recent works introduce multi-agent reflection frameworks where multiple LLM agents critique and refine each other's outputs using reinforcement learning (RL). However, these approaches often rely on single-shot responses and lack structural diversity in reasoning exploration. In this paper, we propose DRAFT-RL, a novel framework that integrates Chain-of-Draft (CoD) reasoning into multi-agent RL training. Instead of generating single responses, each agent produces multiple drafts per query, which are then evaluated by peer agents and a learned reward model to identify the most promising trajectory. These selected drafts are used to refine future reasoning strategies through actor-critic learning.DRAFT-RL enables explicit multi-path exploration, peer-guided reflection, and reward-aligned selection, resulting in more robust and interpretable LLM agent behavior. We evaluate our method on complex reasoning tasks including code synthesis, symbolic math, and knowledge-intensive QA,demonstrating that DRAFT-RL outperforms existing reflective and RL-based agents by significant margins in both accuracy and convergence speed

Conclusion: UoT框架为LLMs的创造性推理提供了系统方法，在需要创新解决方案的任务中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Reasoning based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention due to outstanding performance of these models in mathematical and complex logical tasks. Beginning with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique, numerous reasoning methods have emerged that decompose problems into smaller, sequential steps (or thoughts). However, existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving and do not necessarily generate creative solutions by ``creative reasoning''. In domains where the solution space is expansive and conventional solutions are suboptimal, such as drug discovery or business strategization, creative reasoning to discover innovative solutions is crucial. To address this gap, first we introduce a computational framework for creative reasoning inspired by established cognitive science principles. With this framework, we propose three core creative reasoning paradigms, namely, \textit{combinational}, \textit{exploratory}, and \textit{transformative} reasoning, where each offers specific directions for systematic exploration of the universe of thoughts to generate creative solutions. Next, to materialize this framework using LLMs, we introduce the \textit{Universe of Thoughts} (or \textit{UoT}, for short), a novel set of methods to implement the aforementioned three creative processes. Finally, we introduce three novel tasks that necessitate creative problem-solving, along with an evaluation benchmark to assess creativity from three orthogonal perspectives: feasibility as constraint, and utility and novelty as metrics. With a comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning techniques as well as representative commercial models with reasoning capability, we show that UoT demonstrates superior performance in creative reasoning.

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计和部署最小化隐私泄露的生成模型提供了可操作指导，为更安全的合成网络流量生成奠定了基础。

Abstract: To address the scarcity and privacy concerns of network traffic data, various generative models have been developed to produce synthetic traffic. However, synthetic traffic is not inherently privacy-preserving, and the extent to which it leaks sensitive information, and how to measure such leakage, remain largely unexplored. This challenge is further compounded by the diversity of model architectures, which shape how traffic is represented and synthesized. We introduce a comprehensive set of privacy metrics for synthetic network traffic, combining standard approaches like membership inference attacks (MIA) and data extraction attacks with network-specific identifiers and attributes. Using these metrics, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of different representative generative models and examine the factors that influence attack success. Our results reveal substantial variability in privacy risks across models and datasets. MIA success ranges from 0% to 88%, and up to 100% of network identifiers can be recovered from generated traffic, highlighting serious privacy vulnerabilities. We further identify key factors that significantly affect attack outcomes, including training data diversity and how well the generative model fits the training data. These findings provide actionable guidance for designing and deploying generative models that minimize privacy leakage, establishing a foundation for safer synthetic network traffic generation.

Conclusion: FRAGMENTA展示了智能体调优在捕捉专家意图方面的有效性，能够从循环中移除AI工程师，实现端到端的药物先导化合物优化。

Abstract: Molecule generation using generative AI is vital for drug discovery, yet class-specific datasets often contain fewer than 100 training examples. While fragment-based models handle limited data better than atom-based approaches, existing heuristic fragmentation limits diversity and misses key fragments. Additionally, model tuning typically requires slow, indirect collaboration between medicinal chemists and AI engineers. We introduce FRAGMENTA, an end-to-end framework for drug lead optimization comprising: 1) a novel generative model that reframes fragmentation as a "vocabulary selection" problem, using dynamic Q-learning to jointly optimize fragmentation and generation; and 2) an agentic AI system that refines objectives via conversational feedback from domain experts. This system removes the AI engineer from the loop and progressively learns domain knowledge to eventually automate tuning. In real-world cancer drug discovery experiments, FRAGMENTA's Human-Agent configuration identified nearly twice as many high-scoring molecules as baselines. Furthermore, the fully autonomous Agent-Agent system outperformed traditional Human-Human tuning, demonstrating the efficacy of agentic tuning in capturing expert intent.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在数字健康教育和评估中的广泛应用，需要评估其在药师资格认证等高风险领域特定任务中的能力。

Method: 使用2017-2021年中国药师资格考试的2,306道纯文本选择题，排除含表格或图片的题目，评估两个模型在原始中文格式下的准确率。

Result: DeepSeek-R1整体准确率显著高于ChatGPT-4o（90.0% vs 76.1%, p < 0.001），在基础和临床综合模块表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1在药师资格考试中表现出色，表明领域特定模型在此类场景中具有潜力，但在法律和伦理敏感领域仍需人类监督。

Abstract: Background: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into digital health education and assessment workflows, their capabilities in supporting high-stakes, domain-specific certification tasks remain underexplored.In China, the national pharmacist licensure exam serves as a standardized benchmark for evaluating pharmacists' clinical and theoretical competencies. Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. While year-by-year multiple-choice performance also favored DeepSeek-R1, this performance gap did not reach statistical significance in any specific unit-year (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated robust alignment with the structural and semantic demands of the pharmacist licensure exam. These findings suggest that domain-specific models warrant further investigation for this context, while also reinforcing the necessity of human oversight in legally and ethically sensitive contexts.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are powerful generative tools but often produce factually inaccurate outputs due to a lack of robust reasoning capabilities. While extensive research has been conducted on integrating external knowledge for reasoning in large language models (LLMs), such efforts remain underexplored in VLMs, where the challenge is compounded by the need to bridge multiple modalities seamlessly. This work introduces a framework for knowledge-guided reasoning in VLMs, leveraging structured knowledge graphs for multi-hop verification using image-captioning task to illustrate our framework. Our approach enables systematic reasoning across multiple steps, including visual entity recognition, knowledge graph traversal, and fact-based caption refinement. We evaluate the framework using hierarchical, triple-based and bullet-point based knowledge representations, analyzing their effectiveness in factual accuracy and logical inference. Empirical results show that our approach improves factual accuracy by approximately 31% on preliminary experiments on a curated dataset of mixtures from Google Landmarks v2, Conceptual captions and Coco captions revealing key insights into reasoning patterns and failure modes. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating external knowledge for advancing reasoning in VLMs, paving the way for more reliable and knowledgable multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标如准确率和精确度无法捕捉模型预测的不确定性或可靠性，特别是在对抗性或退化条件下。

Method: 通过信任节点和信任函数并行传播输入、参数和激活信任度，包含参数信任更新机制和推理路径信任评估方法。

Result: 实验表明PaTAS产生可解释、对称且收敛的信任估计，能有效区分良性输入和对抗输入，识别模型置信度与实际可靠性的差异。

Conclusion: PaTAS为评估AI生命周期中的模型可靠性提供了透明且可量化的信任推理基础。

Abstract: Trustworthiness has become a key requirement for the deployment of artificial intelligence systems in safety-critical applications. Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture uncertainty or the reliability of model predictions, particularly under adversarial or degraded conditions. This paper introduces the \emph{Parallel Trust Assessment System (PaTAS)}, a framework for modeling and propagating trust in neural networks using Subjective Logic (SL). PaTAS operates in parallel with standard neural computation through \emph{Trust Nodes} and \emph{Trust Functions} that propagate input, parameter, and activation trust across the network. The framework defines a \emph{Parameter Trust Update} mechanism to refine parameter reliability during training and an \emph{Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA)} method to compute instance-specific trust at inference. Experiments on real-world and adversarial datasets demonstrate that PaTAS produces interpretable, symmetric, and convergent trust estimates that complement accuracy and expose reliability gaps in poisoned, biased, or uncertain data scenarios. The results show that PaTAS effectively distinguishes between benign and adversarial inputs and identifies cases where model confidence diverges from actual reliability. By enabling transparent and quantifiable trust reasoning within neural architectures, PaTAS provides a principled foundation for evaluating model reliability across the AI lifecycle.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将AI组件集成到安全关键系统面临根本性挑战：AI系统不透明性、高层需求与低层网络表示之间的语义鸿沟，以及需求工程中长期存在的自然语言规范模糊性和形式化可扩展性问题。

Method: REACT使用大语言模型连接非正式自然语言需求与形式化规范，实现早期验证；SemaLens利用视觉语言模型基于人类可理解概念对DNN感知系统进行推理、测试和监控。

Result: 构建了从非正式需求到验证实现的综合流程，解决了AI系统验证中的关键挑战。

Conclusion: 利用AI技术本身可以解决AI系统在安全关键应用中的验证难题，通过REACT和SemaLens组件提供了端到端的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of AI components, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), into safety-critical systems such as aerospace and autonomous vehicles presents fundamental challenges for assurance. The opacity of AI systems, combined with the semantic gap between high-level requirements and low-level network representations, creates barriers to traditional verification approaches. These AI-specific challenges are amplified by longstanding issues in Requirements Engineering, including ambiguity in natural language specifications and scalability bottlenecks in formalization. We propose an approach that leverages AI itself to address these challenges through two complementary components. REACT (Requirements Engineering with AI for Consistency and Testing) employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge the gap between informal natural language requirements and formal specifications, enabling early verification and validation. SemaLens (Semantic Analysis of Visual Perception using large Multi-modal models) utilizes Vision Language Models (VLMs) to reason about, test, and monitor DNN-based perception systems using human-understandable concepts. Together, these components provide a comprehensive pipeline from informal requirements to validated implementations.

### [252] [FAST: Topology-Aware Frequency-Domain Distribution Matching for Coreset Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19476)
*Jin Cui,Boran Zhao,Jiajun Xu,Jiaqi Guo,Shuo Guan,Pengju Ren*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: FAST是一个基于谱图理论和特征函数距离的DNN-free核心集选择框架，通过图约束优化和渐进式采样策略，在保持分布等价性的同时显著提升性能并降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择方法要么依赖DNN参数引入架构偏差，要么基于缺乏理论保证的启发式方法，且都无法有效约束分布等价性，也无法准确捕捉高阶矩差异。

Method: 将核心集选择建模为图约束优化问题，使用特征函数距离在频域捕获完整分布信息，提出衰减相位解耦CFD解决梯度消失问题，并设计渐进式差异感知采样策略。

Result: 在所有评估基准上显著优于现有方法，平均准确率提升9.12%，能耗降低96.57%，速度提升2.2倍。

Conclusion: FAST是首个DNN-free分布匹配核心集选择框架，通过频域分析和渐进采样实现了高效、节能的核心集选择，具有理论保证和实际性能优势。

Abstract: Coreset selection compresses large datasets into compact, representative subsets, reducing the energy and computational burden of training deep neural networks. Existing methods are either: (i) DNN-based, which are tied to model-specific parameters and introduce architectural bias; or (ii) DNN-free, which rely on heuristics lacking theoretical guarantees. Neither approach explicitly constrains distributional equivalence, largely because continuous distribution matching is considered inapplicable to discrete sampling. Moreover, prevalent metrics (e.g., MSE, KL, MMD, CE) cannot accurately capture higher-order moment discrepancies, leading to suboptimal coresets. In this work, we propose FAST, the first DNN-free distribution-matching coreset selection framework that formulates the coreset selection task as a graph-constrained optimization problem grounded in spectral graph theory and employs the Characteristic Function Distance (CFD) to capture full distributional information in the frequency domain. We further discover that naive CFD suffers from a "vanishing phase gradient" issue in medium and high-frequency regions; to address this, we introduce an Attenuated Phase-Decoupled CFD. Furthermore, for better convergence, we design a Progressive Discrepancy-Aware Sampling strategy that progressively schedules frequency selection from low to high, preserving global structure before refining local details and enabling accurate matching with fewer frequencies while avoiding overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art coreset selection methods across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy gain of 9.12%. Compared to other baseline coreset methods, it reduces power consumption by 96.57% and achieves a 2.2x average speedup, underscoring its high performance and energy efficiency.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了MCMC方法在任意目标函数应用中的局限性，重点分析了两块MCMC框架的性能对似然函数锐度的依赖性，并通过强化学习任务验证了不同似然锐度对正则化程度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解MCMC方法在任意目标函数上的适用性限制，特别是两块MCMC框架中Metropolis-Hastings和Gibbs采样交替使用时，似然函数锐度如何影响性能表现。

Method: 采用两块MCMC框架，交替使用Metropolis-Hastings和Gibbs采样，引入锐度参数探索不同似然函数形式，并在导航问题和井字棋等强化学习任务中进行实证分析。

Result: 研究发现似然曲率控制着样本内性能和训练数据推断的正则化程度，在极端似然锐度情况下，后验质量会坍缩到单一主导模式上。

Conclusion: 研究结论表明，过度的似然锐度会导致后验质量集中在单一模式，而混合方法（将MCMC第一块替换为迭代优化步骤）能达到与原MCMC框架几乎相同的性能。

Abstract: This study investigates the limitations of applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to arbitrary objective functions, focusing on a two-block MCMC framework which alternates between Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling. While such approaches are often considered advantageous for enabling data-driven regularization, we show that their performance critically depends on the sharpness of the employed likelihood form. By introducing a sharpness parameter and exploring alternative likelihood formulations proportional to the target objective function, we demonstrate how likelihood curvature governs both in-sample performance and the degree of regularization inferred by the training data. Empirical applications are conducted on reinforcement learning tasks: including a navigation problem and the game of tic-tac-toe. The study concludes with a separate analysis examining the implications of extreme likelihood sharpness on arbitrary objective functions stemming from the classic game of blackjack, where the first block of the two-block MCMC framework is replaced with an iterative optimization step. The resulting hybrid approach achieves performance nearly identical to the original MCMC framework, indicating that excessive likelihood sharpness effectively collapses posterior mass onto a single dominant mode.

TL;DR: 本文综述了混合类型数据聚类的最先进方法，并通过多种模拟模型比较了距离基方法（k-prototypes、PDQ、凸k-means）和概率方法（KAMILA、MBNs、LCM）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合类型数据的聚类仍然是一个挑战，因为现有方法很少适合这项任务。本研究旨在通过比较不同方法在各种场景下的表现，为混合数据聚类提供深入见解。

Method: 使用多种模拟模型比较距离基方法（k-prototypes、PDQ、凸k-means）和概率方法（KAMILA、MBNs、LCM），通过调整实验因素如聚类数量、聚类重叠度、样本大小、维度、连续变量比例和聚类分布来评估性能。

Result: 聚类重叠度、连续变量比例和样本大小对性能有显著影响。当变量间存在强交互作用且明确依赖于聚类成员关系时，所有评估方法均表现不佳。在实验中，KAMILA、LCM和k-prototypes在调整兰德指数（ARI）方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: KAMILA、LCM和k-prototypes是处理混合类型数据聚类的有效方法，所有方法均可在R语言中使用。变量间强交互作用和明确聚类依赖关系仍是当前方法的挑战。

Abstract: Clustering is widely used in unsupervised learning to find homogeneous groups of observations within a dataset. However, clustering mixed-type data remains a challenge, as few existing approaches are suited for this task. This study presents the state-of-the-art of these approaches and compares them using various simulation models. The compared methods include the distance-based approaches k-prototypes, PDQ, and convex k-means, and the probabilistic methods KAy-means for MIxed LArge data (KAMILA), the mixture of Bayesian networks (MBNs), and latent class model (LCM). The aim is to provide insights into the behavior of different methods across a wide range of scenarios by varying some experimental factors such as the number of clusters, cluster overlap, sample size, dimension, proportion of continuous variables in the dataset, and clusters' distribution. The degree of cluster overlap and the proportion of continuous variables in the dataset and the sample size have a significant impact on the observed performances. When strong interactions exist between variables alongside an explicit dependence on cluster membership, none of the evaluated methods demonstrated satisfactory performance. In our experiments KAMILA, LCM, and k-prototypes exhibited the best performance, with respect to the adjusted rand index (ARI). All the methods are available in R.

TL;DR: BTN-V是一种贝叶斯张量网络Volterra核机器学习方法，通过规范多分量分解表示Volterra核，将模型复杂度从O(I^D)降低到O(DIR)，并提供预测不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Volterra级数建模非线性系统时，核系数数量随模型阶数呈指数增长，导致模型复杂度高。

Method: 使用规范多分量分解表示Volterra核，将所有张量分量和超参数视为随机变量，采用稀疏诱导分层先验实现自动秩确定和衰落记忆行为学习。

Result: 实验结果显示具有竞争力的准确性、增强的不确定性量化和降低的计算成本。

Conclusion: BTN-V框架在Volterra系统辨识中实现了复杂度降低、不确定性估计和自动模型选择，提高了可解释性并防止过拟合。

Abstract: Modeling nonlinear systems with Volterra series is challenging because the number of kernel coefficients grows exponentially with the model order. This work introduces Bayesian Tensor Network Volterra kernel machines (BTN-V), extending the Bayesian Tensor Network framework to Volterra system identification. BTN-V represents Volterra kernels using canonical polyadic decomposition, reducing model complexity from O(I^D) to O(DIR). By treating all tensor components and hyperparameters as random variables, BTN-V provides predictive uncertainty estimation at no additional computational cost. Sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors enable automatic rank determination and the learning of fading-memory behavior directly from data, improving interpretability and preventing overfitting. Empirical results demonstrate competitive accuracy, enhanced uncertainty quantification, and reduced computational cost.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用连续渗流理论分析生成模型的几何支撑，建立了随机几何图拓扑相变与数据流形之间的同构关系，并开发了可微分的渗流失函数来防止流形收缩，实现超泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从观察者视角看，生成建模需要将几何支撑与概率分布解耦，而连续渗流理论特别适合这种支撑分析，因为它将高维密度估计转化为支撑上的几何计数问题。

Method: 建立随机几何图拓扑相变与高维数据流形之间的严格同构关系，分析渗流偏移度量与FID的关系，并将此拓扑现象转化为可微分的损失函数来指导训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法不仅能防止流形收缩，还能驱动模型达到"超泛化"状态，同时保持良好的保真度和验证的拓扑扩展。

Conclusion: 连续渗流理论为生成模型的几何支撑分析提供了有效框架，通过拓扑方法可以捕获统计指标无法检测的结构病理，并实现更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Generative modeling is typically framed as learning mapping rules, but from an observer's perspective without access to these rules, the task manifests as disentangling the geometric support from the probability distribution. We propose that Continuum Percolation is uniquely suited for this support analysis, as the sampling process effectively projects high-dimensional density estimation onto a geometric counting problem on the support. In this work, we establish a rigorous isomorphism between the topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we demonstrate that our metric captures structural pathologies (such as implicit mode collapse) where statistical metrics fail. Finally, we translate this topological phenomenon into a differentiable loss function to guide training. Experimental results confirm that this approach not only prevents manifold shrinkage but drives the model toward a state of "Hyper-Generalization," achieving good fidelity and verified topological expansion.

TL;DR: 提出了时空分层因果模型（ST-HCMs），通过分层建模处理时空数据中的未观测混杂因素，特别是时间不变的单位级混杂因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空因果推断方法通常假设所有混杂因素都被观测到，但实践中存在未观测的单位级混杂因素，这限制了因果推断的准确性。

Method: 引入时空分层因果模型框架，提出时空折叠定理，证明随着子单元数据增加，复杂分层模型会收敛到简单平面因果模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了框架的有效性，能够恢复存在未观测混杂因素时的因果效应。

Conclusion: ST-HCMs为复杂动态系统中的稳健因果推断提供了新方法，特别适用于处理时空数据中的未观测混杂问题。

Abstract: The abundance of fine-grained spatio-temporal data, such as traffic sensor networks, offers vast opportunities for scientific discovery. However, inferring causal relationships from such observational data remains challenging, particularly due to unobserved confounders that are specific to units (e.g., geographical locations) yet influence outcomes over time. Most existing methods for spatio-temporal causal inference assume that all confounders are observed, an assumption that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs), a novel graphical framework that extends hierarchical causal modeling to the spatio-temporal domain. At the core of our approach is the Spatio-Temporal Collapse Theorem, which shows that a complex ST-HCM converges to a simpler flat causal model as the amount of subunit data increases. This theoretical result enables a general procedure for causal identification, allowing ST-HCMs to recover causal effects even in the presence of unobserved, time-invariant unit-level confounders, a scenario where standard non-hierarchical models fail. We validate the effectiveness of our framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its potential for robust causal inference in complex dynamic systems.
