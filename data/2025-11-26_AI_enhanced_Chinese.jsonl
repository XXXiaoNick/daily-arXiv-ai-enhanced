Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation. Our results show that verifiable multi-hop reasoning does not require massive models at inference time, but rather the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8df3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1aLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c4\u5212\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6b21LLM\u8c03\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u7cfb\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f15\u5bfc\u795e\u7ecf\u641c\u7d22\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664LLM\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u878d\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8df3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6602\u8d35\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7b54\u6848\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "method": "1.

We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments.

This paper focuses on a specific modeling approach that includes dozens of individual BEV profiles rather than one aggregated BEV profile. Although including additional BEV profiles increases model complexity and runtime, it avoids losing information in the aggregation process. We investigate how many profiles are needed to ensure the accuracy of the results and the extent to which fewer profiles can be traded for runtime efficiency gains. We also examine whether selecting specific profiles influences optimal results. We demonstrate that including too few profiles may result in distorted optimal solutions. However, beyond a certain threshold, adding more profiles does not significantly enhance the robustness of the results.

The massive amount of data generated; by the propensity of tourists to share comments and photos during their trip; makes it possible to model their journeys and analyze their behavior. Predicting the next movement of tourists plays a key role in tourism marketing to understand demand and improve decision support. In this paper, we propose a method to understand and to learn tourists' movements based on social network data analysis to predict future movements.

Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care.

Existing methods are either: (i) DNN-based, which are tied to model-specific parameters and introduce architectural bias; or (ii) DNN-free, which rely on heuristics lacking theoretical guarantees. Neither approach explicitly constrains distributional equivalence, largely because continuous distribution matching is considered inapplicable to discrete sampling. Moreover, prevalent metrics (e.g., MSE, KL, MMD, CE) cannot accurately capture higher-order moment discrepancies, leading to suboptimal coresets. In this work, we propose FAST, the first DNN-free distribution-matching coreset selection framework that formulates the coreset selection task as a graph-constrained optimization problem grounded in spectral graph theory and employs the Characteristic Function Distance (CFD) to capture full distributional information in the frequency domain. We further discover that naive CFD suffers from a \"vanishing phase gradient\" issue in medium and high-frequency regions; to address this, we introduce an Attenuated Phase-Decoupled CFD. Furthermore, for better convergence, we design a Progressive Discrepancy-Aware Sampling strategy that progressively schedules frequency selection from low to high, preserving global structure before refining local details and enabling accurate matching with fewer frequencies while avoiding overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art coreset selection methods across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy gain of 9.12%.

We focus on two distinct rare-event regimes where standard Monte Carlo methods suffer from significant variance deterioration: the limit as maturity approaches zero and the limit as the strike price tends to infinity. Leveraging the large deviation principle (LDP), we design a state-dependent change of measure derived from the asymptotic behavior of the log-price cumulant generating functions. In the short-maturity regime, we rigorously prove that our proposed IS drift, inspired by the variational characterization of the rate function, achieves logarithmic efficiency (asymptotic optimality) by minimizing the decay rate of the second moment of the estimator. In the deep OTM regime, we introduce a novel slow mean-reversion scaling for the variance process, where the mean-reversion speed scales as the inverse square of the small-noise parameter (defined as the reciprocal of the log-moneyness). We establish that under this specific scaling, the variance process contributes non-trivially to the large deviation rate function, requiring a specialized Riccati analysis to verify optimality. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields substantial variance reduction--characterized by factors exceeding several orders of magnitude--compared to standard estimators in both asymptotic regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Heston\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u6b27\u5f0f\u770b\u6da8\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5230\u671f\u65e5\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u96f6\u548c\u884c\u6743\u4ef7\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\u4e24\u79cd\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u539f\u7406\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d4b\u5ea6\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728Heston\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u671f\u6743\u5230\u671f\u65e5\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u96f6\u6216\u884c\u6743\u4ef7\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u906d\u9047\u663e\u8457\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u6076\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u60c5\u5f62\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u4ef7\u683c\u7d2f\u79ef\u751f\u6210\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6d4b\u5ea6\u53d8\u6362\u3002\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u9650\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u901f\u7387\u51fd\u6570\u53d8\u5206\u7279\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u7684IS\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u865a\u503c\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b9\u5dee\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6162\u5747\u503c\u56de\u5f52\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5747\u503c\u56de\u5f52\u901f\u5ea6\u6309\u5c0f\u566a\u58f0\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u5012\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6e10\u8fd1\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\uff0c\u7f29\u51cf\u56e0\u5b50\u8d85\u8fc7\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u5728Heston\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u9488\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u9650\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u865a\u503c\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u6076\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

A Critical Framework for Policy Uses of Neuroeconomics", "comment": "Durham Economic Journal 2025", "summary": "Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, \"brain-based\" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies \"true\" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5408\u6cd5\u5730\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u798f\u5229\u5224\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u63cf\u8ff0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u627f\u8bfa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bc1\u636e\u6765\u5efa\u7acb\u798f\u5229\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5f15\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u6765\u4e3a\u5bb6\u957f\u5f0f\u76d1\u7ba1\u3001\"\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8111\"\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u65b0\u798f\u5229\u63aa\u65bd\u8fa9\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u798f\u5229\u6807\u51c6\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u5728\u884c\u52a8\u8005-\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u4ece\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u798f\u5229\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u795e\u7ecf-\u8ba1\u7b97\u6620\u5c04\u5f97\u5230\u826f\u597d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\"\u771f\u5b9e\"\u5229\u76ca\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u798f\u5229\u6807\u51c6\u88ab\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u548c\u8fa9\u62a4\u65f6\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u8bc1\u636e\u624d\u80fd\u7ea6\u675f\u798f\u5229\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5927\u8111\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ef7\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8868\u660e\u5185\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u751f\u7269\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u7684\uff09\u90fd\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u80fd\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u798f\u5229\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002"}}

In this work, we show that this uniqueness does not hold in the convex optimization case: when the operators are subdifferentials of proper, closed, convex functions, a strictly larger class of frugal, no-lifting resolvent-splitting methods is unconditionally convergent. We provide a complete characterization of all such methods in the convex optimization setting and prove that this characterization is sharp: unconditional convergence holds exactly on the identified parameter regions.

Using a convergent mixed-methods design, four STEAM specialists assessed GenAI-generated lesson plans created with a customized Culturally Responsive Lesson Planner (CRLP) and compared them to standardized lesson plans from the Ghana National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA). Quantitative ratings were based on a validated 25-item Culturally Responsive Pedagogy Rubric measuring bias awareness, cultural representation, contextual relevance, linguistic responsiveness, and teacher agency. Qualitative reflections provided additional insight into how GenAI handles cultural and pedagogical appropriateness.\n  Findings show that GenAI, when paired with the CRLP tool, can support contextualized STEAM instruction by linking abstract curriculum standards to learners' cultural knowledge, community practices, and everyday experiences. Experts rated GenAI-assisted lessons as more culturally grounded and pedagogically responsive than NaCCA plans, integrating Indigenous knowledge, bilingual elements, and locally relevant examples. However, GenAI struggled to represent Ghana's cultural pluralism, often offering surface-level references to language, history, and identity.

We leverage the notion of exit time from continuous-time stochastic calculus to formulate a chance-constrained SOC problem. Without any conservative approximation, the chance constraint is transformed into an expectation of an indicator function which can be incorporated into the cost function by considering a dual formulation. We then express the dual function in terms of the solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation parameterized by the dual variable. Under a certain assumption on the system dynamics and cost function, it is shown that a strong duality holds between the primal chance-constrained problem and its dual. The Path integral approach is utilized to numerically solve the dual problem via gradient ascent using open-loop samples of system trajectories. We present simulation studies on chance-constrained motion planning for spatial navigation of mobile robots and the solution of the path integral approach is compared with that of the finite difference method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9000\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u53cc\u5bf9\u5076\u516c\u5f0f\u5c06\u673a\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u671f\u671b\u6307\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\u6982\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4fdd\u5b88\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u673a\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u9000\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u671f\u671b\u6307\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5bf9\u5076\u516c\u5f0f\u5c06\u5176\u7eb3\u5165\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u673a\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u5176\u5bf9\u5076\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Prior work relies on accuracy-based approaches, interpreting performance drops after removing a modality as indicative of its influence. However, such outcome-driven metrics fail to distinguish whether a modality is inherently informative or whether its value arises only through interaction with other modalities. This distinction is particularly important in cross-attention architectures, where modalities influence each other's representations. In this work, we propose a framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that quantifies modality contributions by decomposing predictive information in internal embeddings into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. To enable scalable, inference-only analysis, we develop an algorithm based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) that computes layer and dataset-level contributions without retraining.

While LLMs have thrived on abundant textual data, no comparable corpus exists for CUA trajectories. To address these gaps, we introduce FaraGen, a novel synthetic data generation system for multi-step web tasks. FaraGen can propose diverse tasks from frequently used websites, generate multiple solution attempts, and filter successful trajectories using multiple verifiers. It achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity for multi-step web tasks, producing verified trajectories at approximately $1 each. We use this data to train Fara-7B, a native CUA model that perceives the computer using only screenshots, executes actions via predicted coordinates, and is small enough to run on-device. We find that Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks like WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench -- our novel benchmark that better captures under-represented web tasks in pre-existing benchmarks. Furthermore, Fara-7B is competitive with much larger frontier models, illustrating key benefits of scalable data generation systems in advancing small efficient agentic models.

Using daily data for Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand from 2010 to 2024, we construct a high-frequency institutional learning index via a MIDAS-EPU approach. Unlike existing studies that treat institutional quality as a static background characteristic, this paper models institutions as a dynamic mechanism that reacts to policy shocks, information pressure, and crisis events. Building on this perspective, we introduce two new volatility frameworks: the Institutional Response Dynamics Model (IRDM), which embeds crisis memory, policy shocks, and information flows; and the Network-Integrated IRDM (N-IRDM), which incorporates dynamic-correlation and institutional-similarity networks to capture cross-market transmission. Empirical results show that institutional learning amplifies short-run sensitivity to shocks yet accelerates post-crisis normalization. Crisis-memory terms explain prolonged volatility clustering, while network interactions improve tail behavior and short-horizon forecasts. Robustness checks using placebo and lagged networks indicate that spillovers reflect a strong regional common factor rather than dependence on specific correlation topologies. Diebold-Mariano and ENCNEW tests confirm that the N-IRDM significantly outperforms baseline GARCH benchmarks. The findings highlight a dual role of institutions and offer policy insights on transparency enhancement, macroprudential communication, and coordinated regional governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u9891\u673a\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u6307\u6570\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u673a\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u533a\u57df\u6ea2\u51fa\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e1c\u76df\u80a1\u5e02\u6ce2\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u653e\u5927\u77ed\u671f\u51b2\u51fb\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4f46\u52a0\u901f\u5371\u673a\u540e\u6b63\u5e38\u5316\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e92\u52a8\u6539\u5584\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u673a\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u80cc\u666f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u51b2\u51fb\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u529b\u548c\u5371\u673a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u505a\u51fa\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4e1c\u76df\u80a1\u5e02\u6ce2\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282010-2024\u5e74\u5370\u5c3c\u3001\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a\u3001\u83f2\u5f8b\u5bbe\u548c\u6cf0\u56fd\u7684\u65e5\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MIDAS-EPU\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u9891\u673a\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u673a\u6784\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b(IRDM)\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u6210IRDM(N-IRDM)\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u653e\u5927\u77ed\u671f\u51b2\u51fb\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4f46\u52a0\u901f\u5371\u673a\u540e\u6b63\u5e38\u5316\uff0c\u5371\u673a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9879\u89e3\u91ca\u6301\u7eed\u6ce2\u52a8\u805a\u96c6\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e92\u52a8\u6539\u5584\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002N-IRDM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6GARCH\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u673a\u6784\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u5b8f\u89c2\u5ba1\u614e\u6c9f\u901a\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u533a\u57df\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

While such approaches are often considered advantageous for enabling data-driven regularization, we show that their performance critically depends on the sharpness of the employed likelihood form. By introducing a sharpness parameter and exploring alternative likelihood formulations proportional to the target objective function, we demonstrate how likelihood curvature governs both in-sample performance and the degree of regularization inferred by the training data. Empirical applications are conducted on reinforcement learning tasks: including a navigation problem and the game of tic-tac-toe. The study concludes with a separate analysis examining the implications of extreme likelihood sharpness on arbitrary objective functions stemming from the classic game of blackjack, where the first block of the two-block MCMC framework is replaced with an iterative optimization step. The resulting hybrid approach achieves performance nearly identical to the original MCMC framework, indicating that excessive likelihood sharpness effectively collapses posterior mass onto a single dominant mode.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86MCMC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u5757MCMC\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u9510\u5ea6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4f3c\u7136\u9510\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u7406\u89e3MCMC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e24\u5757MCMC\u6846\u67b6\u4e2dMetropolis-Hastings\u548cGibbs\u91c7\u6837\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u9510\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5757MCMC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f7f\u7528Metropolis-Hastings\u548cGibbs\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9510\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4e95\u5b57\u68cb\u7b49\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4f3c\u7136\u66f2\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u7740\u6837\u672c\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u4f3c\u7136\u9510\u5ea6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u540e\u9a8c\u8d28\u91cf\u4f1a\u574d\u7f29\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u9510\u5ea6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u540e\u9a8c\u8d28\u91cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5c06MCMC\u7b2c\u4e00\u5757\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u539fMCMC\u6846\u67b6\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We present a mathematical derivation of carbon matching using marginal emission rates, where the unit of matching is tons of carbon emitted. We present analysis and open source notebooks showing how marginal emissions can be calculated on simulated electric bus networks. Importantly, we prove mathematically that distinct emissions rates can be assigned to all aspects of the electric grid - including transmission, storage, generation, and consumption - completely allocating electric grid emissions. We show that carbon matching is an accurate carbon accounting framework that can inspire ambitious and impactful action.

This has left agencies in a reactive position, often unaware of how these models construct their persuasive strategies, making it more difficult to sustain communication effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce a large LLM-generated persuasion attack dataset, which includes 134,136 attacks generated by GPT-4, Gemma 2, and Llama 3.1 on agency news. These attacks span 23 persuasive techniques from SemEval 2023 Task 3, directed toward 972 press releases from ten agencies. The generated attacks come in two mediums, press release statements and social media posts, covering both long-form and short-form communication strategies. We analyzed the moral resonance of these persuasion attacks to understand their attack vectors. GPT-4's attacks mainly focus on Care, with Authority and Loyalty also playing a role. Gemma 2 emphasizes Care and Authority, while Llama 3.1 centers on Loyalty and Care.

A rolling-horizon Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy enables closed-loop integration with a traffic simulator, dynamically updating commands based on real-time system states and predictions. Computational efficiency is validated across diverse traffic scenarios, demonstrating a 7-fold reduction in computation time during peak congestion compared to onetime optimization, using Singapore ADS-B dataset.

However, designing optimized prefix adders is challenging due to strict design rules and an exponentially large design space. We introduce PrefixGPT, a generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that directly generates optimized prefix adders from scratch. Our approach represents an adder's topology as a two-dimensional coordinate sequence and applies a legality mask during generation, ensuring every design is valid by construction. PrefixGPT features a customized decoder-only Transformer architecture.

The degree of cluster overlap and the proportion of continuous variables in the dataset and the sample size have a significant impact on the observed performances.

The method is derived from a continuous-time dynamical system whose vector field is obtained by solving a convex QCQP that enforces monotonic descent of the objective and forward invariance of the feasible set. The resulting continuous-time dynamics achieve an $O(1/t)$ convergence rate to first-order stationary points under standard constraint qualification conditions. We then propose a safeguarded Euler discretization with adaptive step-size selection that preserves this convergence rate while maintaining both descent and feasibility in discrete time. To enhance scalability, we develop an active-set variant (SS-QCQP-AS) that selectively enforces constraints near the boundary, substantially reducing computational cost without compromising theoretical guarantees.

However, it is unclear whether compute scaling will persist at current rates through 2030, raising the question of how possible compute slowdowns might impact AI agent capability forecasts. Given a model of time horizon as a function of training compute and algorithms, along with a model of how compute investment spills into algorithmic progress (which, notably, precludes the possibility of a software-only singularity), and the empirical fact that both time horizon and compute have grown at constant rates over 2019--2025, we derive that time horizon growth must be proportional to compute growth.

While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u3001Sepedi\u548cSetswana\u63a8\u6587\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523066%\u300169%\u548c63%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "motivation": "\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u8017\u65f6\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8bcd\u6c47\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8", "result": "\u82f1\u8bed\u63a8\u6587\u6807\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u738766%\uff0cSepedi\u63a8\u658769%\uff0cSetswana\u63a8\u658763%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u53ea\u9700\u4fee\u6b6334%\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6807\u7b7e", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, as the number of agents and task targets increases, existing optimization-based methods often incur prohibitive computational costs, posing significant challenges to large-scale coordination in unmanned systems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a K-means-inspired task allocation framework that reformulates the MTSP as a spatially constrained classification process. By leveraging spatial coherence, the proposed method enables fast estimation of path costs and efficient task grouping, thereby fundamentally reducing overall computational complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the framework can maintain high solution quality even in extremely large-scale scenarios-for instance, in tasks involving 1000 agents and 5000 targets.

We establish key analytical properties of the value function and characterise the optimal capital-injection strategy through an explicit threshold. We also show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the associated HJB variational inequality. For numerical purposes, we first compute a benchmark solution via a monotone finite-difference scheme with Howard's policy iteration. We then develop a reinforcement learning approach based on policy-gradient and actor-critic methods.

GenAI offers unprecedented opportunities for accessibility, scalability and productivity in educational tasks. However, the automation of teaching tasks through GenAI raises concerns about reduced teacher agency, potential cognitive atrophy, and the broader deprofessionalisation of teaching. Drawing findings from prior literature on AI in Education, and refining through a recent systematic literature review, this chapter presents a conceptualisation of five levels of teacher-AI teaming: transactional, situational, operational, praxical and synergistic teaming. The framework aims to capture the nuanced dynamics of teacher-AI interactions, particularly with GenAI, that may lead to the replacement, complementarity, or augmentation of teachers' competences and professional practice. GenAI technological affordances required in supporting teaming, along with empirical studies, are discussed. Drawing on empirical observations, we outline a future vision that moves beyond individual teacher agency toward collaborative decision-making between teachers and AI, in which both agents engage in negotiation, constructive challenge, and co-reasoning that enhance each other's capabilities and enable outcomes neither could realise independently. Further discussion of socio-technical factors beyond teacher-AI teaming is also included to streamline the synergy of teachers and AI in education ethically and practically.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6559\u5e08\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u4e94\u5c42\u6b21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u66ff\u4ee3\u3001\u8865\u5145\u6216\u589e\u5f3a\u6559\u5e08\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u6559\u5e08\u4e0eAI\u534f\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u672a\u6765\u613f\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u7ed9\u6559\u5e08\u5e26\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6559\u5e08\u81ea\u4e3b\u6743\u51cf\u5c11\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u9000\u5316\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u804c\u4e1a\u53bb\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524dAI\u6559\u80b2\u6587\u732e\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6559\u5e08-AI\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u4e94\u5c42\u6b21\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ea4\u6613\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u6027\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u8df5\u6027\u548c\u534f\u540c\u6027\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u6559\u5e08-AI\u534f\u4f5c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6280\u672f\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6559\u5e08\u4e0eAI\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u5546\u3001\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5171\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5f7c\u6b64\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u613f\u666f\u662f\u4ece\u4e2a\u4f53\u6559\u5e08\u81ea\u4e3b\u6743\u8f6c\u5411\u6559\u5e08\u4e0eAI\u7684\u534f\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u5546\u548c\u5171\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u65b9\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u8d85\u8d8a\u6559\u5e08-AI\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6559\u5e08\u4e0eAI\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u534f\u540c\u3002"}}

While previous studies have explored using prompts to elicit specific personality traits in LLMs, they have not optimized these prompts to maximize personality expression. To address this limitation, we propose PersonaPulse: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs, a framework that leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while integrating a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool, ensuring a more realistic and contextually grounded evaluation to guide the optimization process. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies.

A pre-discriminative graph is first constructed to characterize the admissible set of candidate neighbors for each agent. Based on this graph, a dynamic in-neighbor selection strategy is proposed, wherein each agent actively selects a subset of its pre-discriminative neighbors. The number of selected neighbors is adjustable, allowing for a trade-off between communication overhead and robustness, with the minimal case requiring only a single in-neighbor. The proposed strategy facilitates the reconstruction of a directed spanning tree among normal agents following the detection and isolation of Byzantine agents. It achieves resilient consensus without imposing any assumptions on the initial connectivity among normal agents. Moreover, the approach significantly reduces communication burden while maintaining resilience to adversarial behavior. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u90bb\u5c45\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f39\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u5224\u522b\u56fe\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u90bb\u5c45\uff0c\u5728\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f39\u6027\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u5224\u522b\u56fe\u5b9a\u4e49\u5019\u9009\u90bb\u5c45\u96c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u5165\u90bb\u5c45\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e3b\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u9884\u5224\u522b\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u8c03\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9694\u79bb\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\u6709\u5411\u751f\u6210\u6811\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f39\u6027\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u6b63\u5e38\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u505a\u4efb\u4f55\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u90bb\u5c45\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their modular structure introduces a unique vulnerability: adversaries can attempt to compress or repurpose models by pruning experts and cheaply fine-tuning the remainder, effectively bypassing licensing and security constraints. In this paper, we systematically study the prunability of MoE-LLMs under task-specific usage. We first develop an expert attribution framework that identifies the subset of experts most responsible for a given task, then evaluate the performance trade-offs of pruning and re-aligning these experts using active learning-driven fine-tuning. Our findings reveal a critical knowledge loss--recovery trade-off: while certain experts can be isolated to retain task accuracy, significant degradation occurs without targeted re-alignment. Based on this analysis, we propose defense strategies that aim to make MoE models harder to compress and fine-tune without authorization, including entangled expert training and selective fine-tuning protocols that resist unauthorized adaptation.

Correspondence: Rui.Tong@warwick.ac.uk", "summary": "Generative modeling is typically framed as learning mapping rules, but from an observer's perspective without access to these rules, the task manifests as disentangling the geometric support from the probability distribution. We propose that Continuum Percolation is uniquely suited for this support analysis, as the sampling process effectively projects high-dimensional density estimation onto a geometric counting problem on the support. In this work, we establish a rigorous isomorphism between the topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we demonstrate that our metric captures structural pathologies (such as implicit mode collapse) where statistical metrics fail. Finally, we translate this topological phenomenon into a differentiable loss function to guide training. Experimental results confirm that this approach not only prevents manifold shrinkage but drives the model toward a state of \"Hyper-Generalization,\" achieving good fidelity and verified topological expansion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u6e17\u6d41\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u6e17\u6d41\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u6d41\u5f62\u6536\u7f29\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u770b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u652f\u6491\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u800c\u8fde\u7eed\u6e17\u6d41\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8fd9\u79cd\u652f\u6491\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u652f\u6491\u4e0a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8ba1\u6570\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u968f\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u540c\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6e17\u6d41\u504f\u79fb\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0eFID\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6b64\u62d3\u6251\u73b0\u8c61\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u6d41\u5f62\u6536\u7f29\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\"\u8d85\u6cdb\u5316\"\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fde\u7eed\u6e17\u6d41\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u652f\u6491\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u75c5\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.\n  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.\n  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting.

These are the original detailed design notes where my recent CBF-related papers came from", "summary": "In this paper, a state feedback control design with min/max operational limiting constraints is developed for multi-input-multi-output linear time invariant systems. Specifically, servo-tracking control problems with input and output constraints are considered. For static servo-controllers, the output design limits are imposed component-wise on the system selected output, which is of the same dimension as the control input. For dynamic servo-controllers, operational constraints are applied to the system inputs and outputs. The proposed control solution also includes an anti-windup protection logic for dynamic servo-controllers with integral action. The developed method is based on the Nagumo Theorem for forward invariance, the Comparison Lemma for inclusion of input/output inequality constraints, and on the min-norm optimal controllers for synthesis. The derived design is similar and directly related to the method of Control Barrier Functions.

However, the performance of the system is highly dependent on the quality of the retrieval module. If the retrieval results have low relevance to user needs or contain noisy information, it will directly lead to distortion of the generated content. In response to the performance bottleneck of existing models in processing tabular features, this paper proposes an XGBoost machine learning regression model based on feature engineering and particle swarm optimization. Correlation analysis shows that answer_quality is positively correlated with doc_delevance by 0.66, indicating that document relevance has a significant positive effect on answer quality, and improving document relevance may enhance answer quality; The strong negative correlations between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity were -0.89 and -0.88, respectively, indicating a tradeoff between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity. In other words, as the former two increased, diversity significantly decreased. The experimental results comparing decision trees, AdaBoost, etc. show that the VMD PSO BiLSTM model is superior in all evaluation indicators, with significantly lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE compared to the comparison model. The R2 value is higher, indicating that its prediction accuracy, stability, and data interpretation ability are more outstanding.

However, inferring causal relationships from such observational data remains challenging, particularly due to unobserved confounders that are specific to units (e.g., geographical locations) yet influence outcomes over time. Most existing methods for spatio-temporal causal inference assume that all confounders are observed, an assumption that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs), a novel graphical framework that extends hierarchical causal modeling to the spatio-temporal domain. At the core of our approach is the Spatio-Temporal Collapse Theorem, which shows that a complex ST-HCM converges to a simpler flat causal model as the amount of subunit data increases. This theoretical result enables a general procedure for causal identification, allowing ST-HCMs to recover causal effects even in the presence of unobserved, time-invariant unit-level confounders, a scenario where standard non-hierarchical models fail. We validate the effectiveness of our framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its potential for robust causal inference in complex dynamic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u5c42\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08ST-HCMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5355\u4f4d\u7ea7\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u90fd\u88ab\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5355\u4f4d\u7ea7\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u5c42\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u7a7a\u6298\u53e0\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u968f\u7740\u5b50\u5355\u5143\u6570\u636e\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7b80\u5355\u5e73\u9762\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u65f6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-HCMs\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6df7\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In recent months, for example, three leading AI developers applied enhanced safeguards to their new models, as their internal pre-deployment testing could not rule out the possibility that these models could be misused to help create biological weapons. Beyond specific precautionary measures, there have been a range of other advances in techniques for making AI models and systems more reliable and resistant to misuse. These include new approaches in adversarial training, data curation, and monitoring systems. In parallel, institutional frameworks that operationalise and formalise these technical capabilities are starting to emerge: the number of companies publishing Frontier AI Safety Frameworks more than doubled in 2025, and governments and international organisations have established a small number of governance frameworks for general-purpose AI, focusing largely on transparency and risk assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "2025\u5e74\u56fd\u9645AI\u5b89\u5168\u62a5\u544a\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u7528AI\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5305\u62ecAI\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u52a0\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u3001\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u673a\u6784\u6846\u67b6\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u901a\u7528AI\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9632\u6b62AI\u88ab\u6ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u5236\u9020\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u7b49\u5371\u9669\u7528\u9014\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790AI\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u3001\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\uff08\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u548c\u673a\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u53d1\u5e03\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u7acb\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981AI\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5df2\u5bf9\u65b0\u578b\u53f7\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u524d\u6cbfAI\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u53d1\u5e03\u516c\u53f8\u6570\u91cf\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u653f\u5e9c\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f00\u59cb\u5efa\u7acb\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u7528AI\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u5728\u6280\u672f\u548c\u673a\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u5173\u6ce8\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

For CUAs to operate effectively, application selection, which refers to deciding which application to use before invoking fine-grained tools such as APIs, is a fundamental capability. It determines whether the agent initializes the correct environment, avoids orchestration confusion, and efficiently focuses on relevant context. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess fine-grained API selection, offering limited insight into whether models can reason across and choose between different applications. To fill this gap, we introduce AppSelectBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating application selection in CUAs. AppSelectBench contains a novel user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, together with unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented-settings. AppSelectBench covers one hundred widely used desktop applications and includes more than one hundred thousand realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user tasks. Extensive experiments across both closed-source and open-source large language models reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing that even the most capable models still struggle to make consistent application choices. Together, these results establish AppSelectBench as a foundation for studying and advancing application level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs.

Shorter MTUs and shorter gate closures lower the entrance barriers of demand side aggregators that face significant uncertainty on longer time scales. We study the business case for aggregated EV fleets participating in the Nordic 15-minute mFRR Energy Activation Market (EAM). Motivated by increasing system granularity and rapid EV uptake, we represent fleet flexibility as a virtual battery with time-varying power and energy envelopes and formulate a risk-aware stochastic optimisation that co-ordinates day-ahead scheduling with quarter-hour mFRR bidding. Using synthetic residential charging cohorts and observed day-ahead prices on two stylised days, we compare an independent day-ahead baseline to a co-optimised strategy under conservative availability and a CVaR-augmented objective. Across both price cases, co-optimisation increases expected profit and lowers downside risk: the model buys less energy day-ahead and shifts procurement toward mFRR down while flattening the charging plan to retain eligibility for mFRR up. Profit decomposition shows that the uplift is driven by higher mFRR down revenues and reduced reliance on unwinding day-ahead positions.

However, vital signs are often noisy and exhibit rapid fluctuations, while laboratory tests suffer from missing values, measurement lags, and device-specific bias, making integrative forecasting highly challenging. To address these issues, we propose OmniTFT, a deep learning framework that jointly learns and forecasts high-frequency vital signs and sparsely sampled laboratory results based on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Specifically, OmniTFT implements four novel strategies to enhance performance: sliding window equalized sampling to balance physiological states, frequency-aware embedding shrinkage to stabilize rare-class representations, hierarchical variable selection to guide model attention toward informative feature clusters, and influence-aligned attention calibration to enhance robustness during abrupt physiological changes. By reducing the reliance on target-specific architectures and extensive feature engineering, OmniTFT enables unified modeling of multiple heterogeneous clinical targets while preserving cross-institutional generalizability. Across forecasting tasks, OmniTFT achieves substantial performance improvement for both vital signs and laboratory results on the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU datasets. Its attention patterns are interpretable and consistent with known pathophysiology, underscoring its potential utility for quantitative decision support in clinical care.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniTFT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTemporal Fusion Transformer\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4bICU\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "ICU\u4e2d\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u6ce2\u52a8\u5feb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u5747\u8861\u91c7\u6837\u5e73\u8861\u751f\u7406\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u5d4c\u5165\u6536\u7f29\u7a33\u5b9a\u7f55\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\u7279\u5f81\u7c07\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6821\u51c6\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u7406\u7a81\u53d8\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC-III\u3001MIMIC-IV\u548ceICU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cOmniTFT\u5bf9\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u75c5\u7406\u751f\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniTFT\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u5f02\u8d28\u4e34\u5e8a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Moon"], "title": "The Generalized Proximity Forest", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent work has demonstrated the utility of Random Forest (RF) proximities for various supervised machine learning tasks, including outlier detection, missing data imputation, and visualization. However, the utility of the RF proximities depends upon the success of the RF model, which itself is not the ideal model in all contexts. RF proximities have recently been extended to time series by means of the distance-based Proximity Forest (PF) model, among others, affording time series analysis with the benefits of RF proximities. In this work, we introduce the generalized PF model, thereby extending RF proximities to all contexts in which supervised distance-based machine learning can occur.

Many existing distributed algorithms rely on solving local subproblems via the $\\operatorname{argmin}$ operator in each iteration. Such approaches become computationally burdensome or intractable when local cost functions are complex. To address this challenge, we propose a novel distributed gradient-based algorithm that avoids solving a local optimization problem at each iteration by leveraging first-order approximations and projection onto local feasible sets. The algorithm operates in a fully distributed manner, requiring only local communication without exchanging gradients or primal variables. We rigorously establish sublinear convergence for general convex cost functions and linear convergence under strong convexity and smoothness conditions.

Auditing Aesthetic Bias in the Visual Representation of Holocaust Victims on Google", "comment": "22 pages", "summary": "Information retrieval systems, such as search engines, increasingly shape the representation of the past and present states of social reality. Despite their importance, these systems face challenges in dealing with the ethical aspects of representation due to various forms of bias, including aesthetic bias that perpetuates hegemonic patterns of representation. While most research on aesthetic bias has examined it in the context of current societal issues, it is also crucial for historical representation, particularly of sensitive subjects such as historical atrocities. To address this gap, we conduct a comparative audit of the visual representation of Holocaust victims on Google. We find that Google tends to propagate a male-dominated representation of Holocaust victims with an emphasis on atrocity context, risking rendering invisible gender-specific suffering and decreasing potential for nurturing empathy. We also observe a variation in representation across geographic locations, suggesting that search algorithms may produce their own aesthetic of victimhood.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9Google\u4e0a\u5927\u5c60\u6740\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u89c6\u89c9\u5448\u73b0\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u4f20\u64ad\u7537\u6027\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u5f62\u8c61\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u66b4\u884c\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u6027\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u82e6\u96be\u5e76\u524a\u5f31\u5171\u60c5\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5448\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5851\u9020\u793e\u4f1a\u73b0\u5b9e\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4f26\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5ba1\u7f8e\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5f53\u524d\u793e\u4f1a\u8bae\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u5f81\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u654f\u611f\u5386\u53f2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5982\u5927\u5c60\u6740\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5ba1\u7f8e\u504f\u89c1\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9Google\u4e0a\u5927\u5c60\u6740\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u89c6\u89c9\u5448\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "Google\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f20\u64ad\u7537\u6027\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u5927\u5c60\u6740\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u66b4\u884c\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f\u6027\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u82e6\u96be\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5171\u60c5\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5448\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u5ba1\u7f8e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u5ba1\u7f8e\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5386\u53f2\u654f\u611f\u4e3b\u9898\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u907f\u514d\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5171\u60c5\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines.

Two primary approaches can be applied to improve the performance of LLMs: fine-tuning, which aligns LLM predictions more closely with human responses, and rectification, which corrects biases in LLM outputs. In this paper, we develop a framework that combines fine-tuning and rectification, and optimally allocates limited labeled samples across the two stages. Unlike the conventional objective that minimizes the mean squared prediction errors, we propose to minimize the variance of the prediction errors as the fine-tuning objective, which is optimal for the downstream rectification stage. Building on this insight, we leverage empirical scaling laws to develop a data-driven method for optimally splitting samples between the fine-tuning and rectification stages. Empirical analysis validates our framework, demonstrating improved estimation and inference performance compared to using either fine-tuning or rectification alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u6821\u6b63\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u793e\u79d1\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u9636\u6bb5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency.

We define what counts as a digital ghost, trace their rise across personal, commercial, and institutional contexts, and identify core ethical tensions around grief and well-being, truthfulness and deception, consent and posthumous privacy, dignity and misrepresentation, and the commercialization of mourning. To analyze these challenges, we propose a nine-dimensional taxonomy of digital afterlife technologies and, building on it, outline the features of an ethically acceptable digital ghost: premortem intent, mutual consent, transparent and limited data use, clear disclosure, restricted purposes and access, family or estate stewardship, and minimal behavioral agency.

Code available at https://github.com/mihirs-0/synass", "summary": "Transformers are theoretically reversal-invariant: their function class does not prefer left-to-right over right-to-left mappings. Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a \"reversal curse,\" and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Transformers\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u53cd\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Transformer\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53cd\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5b58\u5728\"\u53cd\u8f6c\u8bc5\u5492\"\u3002\u9700\u8981\u533a\u5206\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u8fd8\u662f\u67b6\u6784\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u5408\u6210\u7684\u3001\u71b5\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u968f\u673a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u6620\u5c04\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8c03\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50K\u521b\u5efa\u524d\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u96f6\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\uff09\u548c\u9006\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6709\u71b5\u4e0b\u9650\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83GPT-2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GPT-2\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u5982K=5\u65f61.16 nats\uff09\uff0c\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684MLP\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6539\u53d8\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4f46\u4e0d\u6d88\u9664\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0cLoRA\u5728\u9ad8\u71b5\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u4e0a\u9047\u5230\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u79fb\u9664\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u8bcd\u9891\u548c\u8bed\u6599\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u540e\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

Levin"], "title": "An Exact Solution Algorithm for the Bi-Level Optimization Problem of Electric Vehicles Charging Station Placement", "comment": null, "summary": "This work addresses electric vehicle (EV) charging station placement through a bi-level optimization model, where the upper-level planner maximizes net revenue by selecting station locations under budget constraints, while EV users at the lower level choose routes and charging stations to minimize travel and charging costs. To account for range anxiety, we construct a battery-expanded network and apply a shortest path algorithm with Frank-Wolfe traffic assignment. Our primary contribution is developing the first exact solution algorithm for large scale EV charging station placement problems. We propose a Branch-and-Price-and-Cut algorithm enhanced with value function cuts and column generation. While existing research relies on heuristic methods that provide no optimality guarantees or exact algorithms that require prohibitively long runtimes, our exact algorithm delivers globally optimal solutions with mathematical certainty under a reasonable runtime. Computational experiments on the Eastern Massachusetts network (74 nodes, 248 links), the Anaheim network (416 nodes, 914 links), and the Barcelona network (110 zones, 1,020 nodes, and 2,512 links) demonstrate exceptional performance. Our algorithm terminates within minutes rather than hours, while achieving optimality gaps below 1% across all instances. This result represents a computational speedup of over two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods.

Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models. Overall, we propose a unified, metric-grounded perspective on prompt quality, and demonstrated that our evaluation-instructed optimization pipeline delivers stable, interpretable, and model-agnostic improvements across diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6267\u884c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u6216\u9ed1\u76d2\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f31\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u4e49\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u53f7\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u6027\u80fd\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u6267\u884c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u7ef4\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u5ea6\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8bca\u65ad\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u5f0f\u91cd\u5199\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u57288\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3\u4e2a\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u677f\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u57fa\u7840\u63d0\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

We formalize this tension as the Alignment Trilemma: no RLHF system can simultaneously achieve (i) epsilon-representativeness across diverse human values, (ii) polynomial tractability in sample and compute complexity, and (iii) delta-robustness against adversarial perturbations and distribution shift. Through a complexity-theoretic analysis integrating statistical learning theory and robust optimization, we prove that achieving both representativeness (epsilon <= 0.01) and robustness (delta <= 0.001) for global-scale populations requires Omega(2^{d_context}) operations, which is super-polynomial in the context dimensionality. We show that current RLHF implementations resolve this trilemma by sacrificing representativeness: they collect only 10^3--10^4 samples from homogeneous annotator pools while 10^7--10^8 samples are needed for true global representation. Our framework provides a unified explanation for documented RLHF pathologies including preference collapse, sycophancy, and systematic bias amplification.

Using a leak-aware longitudinal panel of 1,343 students and a manually implemented LinearDML estimator, we estimate lagged causal effects of strike exposure and its interaction with inflation at entry. The temporal profile is clear: only strikes occurring two semesters earlier have a significant impact on next-semester dropout in simple lagged logit models (ATE = 0.0323, p = 0.0173), while other lags are negligible. When we move to double machine learning and control flexibly for academic progression, curriculum friction and calendar effects, the main effect of strikes at lag 2 becomes small and statistically non-significant, but the interaction between strikes and inflation at entry remains positive and robust (estimate = 0.0625, p = 0.0033). A placebo model with a synthetic strike variable yields null effects, and a robustness audit (seed sensitivity, model comparisons, SHAP inspection) confirms the stability of the interaction across specifications. SHAP analysis also reveals that Strikes_Lag2 and Inflation_at_Entry jointly contribute strongly to predicted dropout risk. These findings align with the CAPIRE-MACRO agent-based simulations and support the view that macro shocks act as coupled stressors mediated by curriculum friction and financial resilience rather than isolated events.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53cc\u91cd\u538b\u529b\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6559\u5e08\u7f62\u5de5\uff08\u8fd1\u7aef\u51b2\u51fb\uff09\u548c\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\uff08\u8fdc\u7aef\u51b2\u51fb\uff09\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u751f\u8f8d\u5b66\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7f62\u5de5\u6ede\u540e2\u5b66\u671f\u4e0e\u5165\u5b66\u65f6\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6700\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u963f\u6839\u5ef7\u957f\u671f\u5de5\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u672f\u4eba\u5458\u7f62\u5de5\u548c\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u662f\u5426\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cc\u91cd\u538b\u529b\u6e90\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u751f\u8f8d\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b1,343\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528LinearDML\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5206\u6790\u7f62\u5de5\u66b4\u9732\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5165\u5b66\u65f6\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u8f8d\u5b66\u7684\u6ede\u540e\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u7f62\u5de5\u6ede\u540e2\u5b66\u671f\u4e0e\u5165\u5b66\u65f6\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u8f8d\u5b66\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff08\u4f30\u8ba1\u503c=0.0625\uff0cp=0.0033\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u7f62\u5de5\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u540e\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b8f\u89c2\u51b2\u51fb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u538b\u529b\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u97e7\u6027\u673a\u5236\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u751f\u8f8d\u5b66\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002"}}

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard (\"Social Media Screener\") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators.

The emerging digital twin (DT) technology provides a safe and controlled virtual environment for agentic AI training, but its effectiveness critically depends on the DT's fidelity. Policies trained in a low-fidelity DT that does not accurately represent the physical network may experience severe performance degradation upon real-world deployment. In this article, we introduce a unified DT evaluation framework to ensure trustworthy DTs in agentic AI-based network optimization. This evaluation framework shifts from conventional isolated physical accuracy metrics, such as wireless channel and user trajectory similarities, to a more holistic, task-centric DT assessment. We demonstrate it as an effective guideline for design, selection, and lifecycle management of wireless network DTs. A comprehensive case study on a real-world wireless network testbed shows how this evaluation framework is used to pre-filter candidate DTs, leading to a significant reduction in training and testing costs without sacrificing deployment performance.

However, existing CSI feedback models struggle to adapt to dynamic environments caused by user mobility, requiring retraining when encountering new CSI distributions. Moreover, returning to previously encountered environments often leads to performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning involves enabling models to incorporate new information while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based learning approach for CSI feedback.

Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.\n  We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $\u03c9$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $\u03c9$-regular objective while also adhering to $\u03c9$-regular constraints within specified thresholds.

A dominant line of work seeks robustness by learning a robust representation, often explicitly partitioning the latent space into core and spurious components; this approach can be complex, brittle, and difficult to scale. We take a different approach, instead of a robust representation, we learn a robust function. We present a simple and effective training method that renders the classifier functionally invariant to shortcut signals. Our method operates within a disentangled latent space, which is essential as it isolates spurious and core features into distinct dimensions. This separation enables the identification of candidate shortcut features by their strong correlation with the label, used as a proxy for semantic simplicity. The classifier is then desensitized to these features by injecting targeted, anisotropic latent noise during training. We analyze this as targeted Jacobian regularization, which forces the classifier to ignore spurious features and rely on more complex, core semantic signals.

When these initiatives are structured as open-enrollment extracurricular programs, their success often depends on their marketing approach. However, there is little in the computing education research literature about how to conduct effective marketing for these initiatives. We describe the changes made to the marketing strategy of one such program, an educational hackathon for middle school and high school students in the Pacific Northwest.

This paper provides a baseline evaluation of the energy management systems (EMSs) implementation and their impact on energy consumption, carbon emissions, and operational costs in smart ports. Initially, we provide a systematic review of the literature focusing on case studies from prominent ports, including Hamburg, Genoa, Jurong, and Shanghai Yangshan Phase IV. The analysis emphasises key aspects such as energy efficiency, reductions in emissions, and the minimization of operational costs. Subsequently, we formulate an optimisation model to simulate load dispatch, carbon emission reduction, and transport scheduling. Results indicate that EMS deployment reduces annual energy consumption and carbon emissions significantly by approximately 7%-8% and 11%-12% respectively, while achieving substantial cost savings of 30%.

This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\\% compared to traditional instruction.

This makes modifying such models for tasks such as pruning or unlearning constrained by this unavailability an active area of research. Existing techniques typically require gradients or ground-truth labels, rendering them infeasible in settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global reconstruction error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term Subset Fidelity. In the uncorrelated features setting, selecting individual components via their Subset Fidelity scores is optimal, which we use to propose ModHiFi, an algorithm for model modification that requires no training data or loss function access. ModHiFi-P, for structured pruning, achieves an 11% speedup over the current state of the art on ImageNet models and competitive performance on language models.

However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization.

However, its performance deteriorates under poor initialization or extreme operating scenarios, e.g., high levels of renewable energy penetration. Traditional NR initialization strategies often fail to address these challenges, resulting in slow convergence or even divergence. We propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the initialization of NR, and introduce a novel quantum-enhanced RL environment update mechanism to mitigate the significant computational cost of evaluating power system states over a combinatorially large action space at each RL timestep by formulating the voltage adjustment task as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. Specifically, quantum/digital annealers are integrated into the RL environment update to evaluate state transitions using a problem Hamiltonian designed for PF. Results demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed, a reduction in NR iteration counts, and enhanced robustness under different operating conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u725b\u987f-\u62c9\u592b\u900a\u6cd5\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f6e\u6d41\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u725b\u987f-\u62c9\u592b\u900a\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u826f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6216\u6781\u7aef\u8fd0\u884c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u7f13\u6162\u751a\u81f3\u53d1\u6563\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316NR\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684RL\u73af\u5883\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u7535\u538b\u8c03\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u91cf\u5b50/\u6570\u5b57\u9000\u706b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0cNR\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u725b\u987f-\u62c9\u592b\u900a\u6cd5\u5728\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f6e\u6d41\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose a collaborative Conversational Embodied Intelligence Network (CC-EIN) integrating multimodal feature fusion, adaptive semantic communication, task coordination, and interpretability. PerceptiNet performs cross-modal fusion of image and radar data to generate unified semantic representations. An adaptive semantic communication strategy dynamically adjusts coding schemes and transmission power according to task urgency and channel quality. A semantic-driven collaboration mechanism further supports task decomposition and conflict-free coordination among heterogeneous devices.

Once trained, they offer fast inference and reasonably high-quality solutions for in-distribution testing instances, but they generally fall short in terms of absolute solution quality compared to classical search-based algorithms that are admittedly slower but offer optimality guarantee once search finishes.\n  We propose a novel framework that combines the inference efficiency and exploratory power of neural models with the solution quality guarantee of search-based algorithms. In particular, we use parameterized algorithms (PAs) as the search component. PAs are dedicated to identifying easy instances of generally NP-hard problems, and allow for practically efficient search by exploiting structural simplicity (of the identified easy instances). Under our framework, we use parameterized analysis to identify the structurally hard parts of a CO instance. The neural model handles the hard parts by generating advisory signals based on its data-driven understanding. The PA-based search component then integrates the advisory signals to systematically and efficiently searches through the remaining structurally easy parts. Notably, our framework is agnostic to the choice of neural model and produces strictly better solutions than neural solvers alone.\n  We examine our framework on multiple CO tasks. Empirical results show that it achieves superior solution quality, competitive with that of commercial solvers.

This has implications for optimal control and reinforcement learning since it implies that the exact computation of these value functions requires templates involving functions that are non-differentiable on dense subsets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5207\u6362\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u5207\u6362\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5207\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u4e5f\u662fLipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u5149\u6ed1\u4e14Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7a20\u5bc6\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5207\u6362\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6784\u9020\u53cd\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7a20\u5bc6\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u662fLipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5149\u6ed1\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u7a20\u5bc6\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5207\u6362\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u5728\u7a20\u5bc6\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches face key limitations: answer choices are typically presented to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation. This absence of context can lead to incomplete exploration of all possible answers, ultimately degrading the models' reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction. It consists of two components: first, a reasoning generation stage, where the model is prompted to produce supportive reasonings for each answer option, and then, a reasoning-guided agreement stage, where the generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer. Through comprehensive evaluations, BiasPrompting demonstrates significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks.

The assigned probability thus considers the object's visibility relative to the sensor, under the presence of other objects.

This work systematically examines how these techniques perform both independently and in combination when applied to the Qwen2.5 3B model. We evaluate multiple compression pipelines, including single, and proposed three-technique sequences, using perplexity, G-Eval, clarity, prompt alignment, and compression ratio as metrics. Our experiments show that quantization provides the greatest standalone compression, while pruning introduces moderate quality degradation. Critically, the ordering of techniques significantly affects the final model quality: the sequence Pruning, Knowledge Distillation, Quantization (P-KD-Q) yields the best balance, achieving a 3.68x compression ratio while preserving strong instruction-following and language understanding capabilities. Conversely, pipelines applying quantization early suffer severe performance degradation due to irreversible information loss that impairs subsequent training.

We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries. Follow-up confidence prompts yielded modest, mostly downward revisions, suggesting mild overestimation in first-pass assessments. Qualitative analysis showed that higher self-efficacy corresponded to more assertive, anthropomorphic reasoning styles, whereas lower scores reflected cautious, de-anthropomorphized explanations.

In this work, we focus on the smooth nonconvex-strongly-convex setting and develop new hard instances that yield nontrivial lower bounds under deterministic and stochastic first-order oracle models. In the deterministic case, we prove that any first-order zero-respecting algorithm requires at least $\u03a9(\u03ba^{3/2}\u03b5^{-2})$ oracle calls to find an $\u03b5$-accurate stationary point, improving the optimal lower bounds known for single-level nonconvex optimization and for nonconvex-strongly-convex min-max problems. In the stochastic case, we show that at least $\u03a9(\u03ba^{5/2}\u03b5^{-4})$ stochastic oracle calls are necessary, again strengthening the best known bounds in related settings.

Each period involves a worst-case maximization over distributions in a Wasserstein ball around the transition probability of a reference process with radius proportional to the length of the period, and the multi-period DRO problem arises through its sequential composition. We show that the scaling limit of the multi-period DRO, as the length of each period tends to zero, is a strongly continuous monotone semigroup on $\\mathrm{C_b}$. Furthermore, we show that its infinitesimal generator is equal to the generator associated with the non-robust scaling limit plus an additional perturbation term induced by the Wasserstein uncertainty.

Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "SSA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u65e8\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u53cd\u800c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u88ab\u6392\u9664\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u952e\u503c\u5bf9\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6291\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSSA\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fdd\u6301\u6240\u6709token\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u660e\u786e\u9f13\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5176\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "result": "SSA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e38\u8bc6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u6ed1\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7740\u5141\u8bb8\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cSSA\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SSA\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The proposed agentic framework integrates large language models (LLMs) with a professional simulator (ANDES) to automatically generate and filter disturbance scenarios from natural language, and employs an LLM-driven Neural Network Design (LLM-NND) pipeline to autonomously design and optimize TSA models through performance-guided, closed-loop feedback. On the IEEE 39-bus system, the LLM-NND models achieve 93.71% test accuracy on four-class TSA with only 4.78M parameters, while maintaining real-time inference latency (less than 0.95 ms per sample). Compared with a manually designed DenseNet (25.9M parameters, 80.05% accuracy), the proposed approach jointly improves accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy among domain-grounded retrieval, reasoning augmentation, and feedback mechanisms is essential for robust automation. The results demonstrate that LLM agents can reliably accelerate TSA research from scenario generation and data acquisition to model design and interpretation, offering a scalable paradigm that is readily extensible to other power system tasks such as optimal power flow, fault analysis, and market operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6682\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30(TSA)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ba1\u9053\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316TSA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728IEEE 39\u8282\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523093.71%\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684DenseNet\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6682\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eff\u771f\u5668(ANDES)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7b5b\u9009\u6270\u52a8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ba1\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEEE 39\u8282\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0cLLM-NND\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56db\u7c7bTSA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523093.71%\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u97004.78M\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5c0f\u4e8e0.95ms/\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684DenseNet(25.9M\u53c2\u6570\uff0c80.05%\u7cbe\u5ea6)\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u52a0\u901fTSA\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ece\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths.

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing", "summary": "Stochastic convex optimization problems with nonlinear functional constraints are ubiquitous in machine learning applications, including multi-task learning, structured prediction, and multi-view learning. The presence of nonlinear functional constraints renders the traditional projected stochastic gradient descent and related projection-based methods inefficient, and motivates the use of first-order methods. However, existing first-order methods, including primal and primal-dual algorithms, typically rely on a bounded (sub-)gradient assumption, which may be too restrictive in many settings.\n  We propose a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) algorithm that works entirely in the primal domain, avoids projecting onto the feasible region, obviates the need for bounded gradients, and achieves state-of-the-art oracle complexity under standard smoothness and convexity assumptions. A faster version, namely SSQP-Skip, is also proposed where the quadratic subproblems can be skipped in most iterations. Finally, we develop an accelerated variance-reduced version of SSQP (VARAS), whose oracle complexity bounds match those for solving unconstrained finite-sum convex optimization problems.

We recast local Lipschitz continuity of feature attributions as a network community preservation problem, enabling scalable enforcement of spatially coherent explanations without per-sample neighborhood searches. Experiments on two exemplar tasks (county-level GDP in Fujian, n=83; point-wise housing prices in Seattle, n=21,613) show SX-GeoTree maintains competitive predictive accuracy (within 0.01 $R^{2}$ of decision trees) while improving residual spatial evenness and doubling attribution consensus (modularity: Fujian 0.19 vs 0.09; Seattle 0.10 vs 0.05). Ablation confirms Moran's I and modularity terms are complementary; removing either degrades both spatial residual structure and explanation stability.

Experimental baselines using self-supervised learning models demonstrate robust performance in speaker-independent gender-, age-, and personality-based evaluations, with HuBERT-large-EN achieving optimal results. By incorporating linguistic diversity and ecological validity, EM2LDL enables the exploration of complex emotional dynamics in multilingual settings. This work provides a versatile testbed for developing adaptive, empathetic systems for applications in affective computing, including mental health monitoring and cross-cultural communication.

Exploring a better network structure for attention in TSF holds immense significance across various domains. In this paper, we present PeriodNet with a brand new structure to forecast univariate and multivariate time series. PeriodNet incorporates period attention and sparse period attention mechanism for analyzing adjacent periods. It enhances the mining of local characteristics, periodic patterns, and global dependencies. For efficient cross-variable modeling, we introduce an iterative grouping mechanism which can directly reduce the cross-variable redundancy. To fully leverage the extracted features on the encoder side, we redesign the entire architecture of the vanilla Transformer and propose a period diffuser for precise multi-period prediction. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on eight datasets, we demonstrate that PeriodNet outperforms six state-of-the-art models in both univariate and multivariate TSF scenarios in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error.

However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

These gains are highly sensitive to random seeds, data ordering, and implementation details, yet are rarely accompanied by uncertainty estimates or significance tests. It is therefore unclear when a reported +1-2% reflects a real algorithmic advance versus noise.\n  We revisit this problem under realistic compute budgets, where only a few runs are affordable. We propose a simple, PC-friendly evaluation protocol based on paired multi-seed runs, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals, and a sign-flip permutation test on per-seed deltas. The protocol is intentionally conservative and is meant as a guardrail against over-claiming.\n  We instantiate it on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10N, and AG News using synthetic no-improvement, small-gain, and medium-gain scenarios. Single runs and unpaired t-tests often suggest significant gains for 0.6-2.0 point improvements, especially on text. With only three seeds, our paired protocol never declares significance in these settings.

Malikopoulos"], "title": "Accelerating Time-Optimal Trajectory Planning for Connected and Automated Vehicles with Graph Neural Networks", "comment": "submitted to IFAC WC 2026", "summary": "In this paper, we present a learning-based framework that accelerates time- and energy-optimal trajectory planning for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) using graph neural networks (GNNs). We formulate the multi-agent coordination problem encountered in traffic scenarios as a cooperative trajectory planning problem that minimizes travel time, subject to motion primitives derived from energy-optimal solutions. The effectiveness of this framework can be further improved through replanning at each time step, enabling the system to incorporate newly observed information. To achieve real-time execution of such a multi-agent replanning scheme, we employ a GNN architecture to learn the solutions of the time-optimal trajectory planning problem from offline-generated data. The trained model produces online predictions that serve as warm-start solutions for numerical optimization, thereby enabling rapid computation of minimal exit times and the associated feasible trajectories. This learning-augmented approach substantially reduces computation time while ensuring that all state, input, and safety constraints are satisfied.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8054\u7f51\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GNN\u5b66\u4e60\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u884c\u9a76\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u80fd\u91cf\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u4ece\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u89e3\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5c0f\u9000\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u5f97\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GNN\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

However, their behavior in production environments remains poorly understood, and their failure patterns differ fundamentally from those of traditional machine learning models. This paper presents a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes that arise in real-world LLM applications, including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems.

TVM models the transition between any two diffusion timesteps and regularizes its behavior at its terminal time rather than at the initial time. We prove that TVM provides an upper bound on the $2$-Wasserstein distance between data and model distributions when the model is Lipschitz continuous. However, since Diffusion Transformers lack this property, we introduce minimal architectural changes that achieve stable, single-stage training. To make TVM efficient in practice, we develop a fused attention kernel that supports backward passes on Jacobian-Vector Products, which scale well with transformer architectures. On ImageNet-256x256, TVM achieves 3.29 FID with a single function evaluation (NFE) and 1.99 FID with 4 NFEs. It similarly achieves 4.32 1-NFE FID and 2.94 4-NFE FID on ImageNet-512x512, representing state-of-the-art performance for one/few-step models from scratch.", "AI": {"tldr": "TVM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u548c\u5c11\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u5e76\u5728\u7ec8\u7aef\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5c11\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u624d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u4e00\u6b65/\u5c11\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u3002TVM\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u548c\u5c11\u6b65\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec8\u7aef\u901f\u5ea6\u5339\u914d(TVM)\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u610f\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u7ec8\u7aef\u65f6\u95f4\u800c\u975e\u521d\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4fLipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u5c0f\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u652f\u6301Jacobian-\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6838\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-256x256\u4e0a\uff0cTVM\u5355\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u8fbe\u52303.29 FID\uff0c4\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u8fbe\u52301.99 FID\uff1b\u5728ImageNet-512x512\u4e0a\uff0c\u5355\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u8fbe\u52304.32 FID\uff0c4\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u8fbe\u52302.94 FID\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e00\u6b65/\u5c11\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TVM\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec8\u7aef\u65f6\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u548c\u5c11\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC. Our experiments show that carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation significantly enhance correction quality across multiple Indic languages. We achieved leading results in the shared task--ranking 1st in Tamil (GLEU: 91.57) and Hindi (GLEU: 85.69), 2nd in Telugu (GLEU: 85.22), 4th in Bangla (GLEU: 92.86), and 5th in Malayalam (GLEU: 92.97).

Strong", "Samuel Akinwande", "Leila Bridgeman"], "title": "Adaptive Meshing for CPA Lyapunov Function Synthesis", "comment": null, "summary": "Continuous piecewise affine (CPA) Lyapunov function synthesis is one method to perform Lyapunov stability analysis for nonlinear systems. This method first generates a mesh over the region of interest in the system's state space and then solves a linear program (LP), which enforces constraints on each vertex of the mesh, to synthesize a Lyapunov function. Finer meshes broaden the class of Lyapunov function candidates, but CPA function synthesis is more computationally expensive for finer meshes -- particularly so in higher dimensional systems. This paper explores methods to mesh the region of interest more efficiently so that a Lyapunov function can be synthesized using less computational effort. Three methods are explored -- adaptive meshing, meshing using knowledge of the system model, and a combination of the two.

These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \\textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \\textbf{Tri}archy \\textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the \"fake\" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts.

Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology. Extensive experiments on both general and domain-specific mRAG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single-agent and robust multi-agent mRAG systems while significantly reducing token consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86M\u00b3Prune\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u56fe\u526a\u679d\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8fb9\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4etoken\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684token\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u56fe\u526a\u679d\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8fb9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u5316\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u5197\u4f59\u8fb9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684mRAG\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11token\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "M\u00b3Prune\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u548ctoken\u5f00\u9500\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These results clarify the structure and optimization behavior of nonlinearly preconditioned gradient flows and connect them to known continuous-time models in non-Euclidean optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLyapunov\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u955c\u50cf\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6d41\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u4f18\u5316\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Lyapunov\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u51f8\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e0e\u955c\u50cf\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51f8\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u67d0\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u7684\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u68af\u5ea6\u652f\u914d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u6307\u6570\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u6d41\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ee5\u6210\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684Bregman\u6563\u5ea6\u4e3a\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002"}}

The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements. Evaluations on the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets show F1 score gains of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% for discontinuous entities, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684NER\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u5206\u5272\u548c\u9057\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfNER\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8de8\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u5b9e\u4f53\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5272\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u9057\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff08\u88c1\u526a\u3001\u7f29\u653e\u3001\u586b\u5145\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5272\u6311\u6218\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728CADEC\u3001ShARe13\u548cShARe14\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6574\u4f53F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u53471-2.5%\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u53473.7-8.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347NER\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We leverage ReLU neural networks (NNs) to create continuous piecewise affine (CPA) BFs with deterministic safety guarantees for Lipschitz continuous, discrete-time dynamical system using sampled one-step trajectories.

We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems.

Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the resulting model achieves superior performance on observability datasets while retaining very similar performance on a standard general-purpose forecasting benchmark (GIFT-Eval), and suggest that the multiresolution structure enables the model to make more accurate predictions on long context input.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cisco Time Series Model\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7300B\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u901a\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b(TimesFM)\u8fdb\u884c\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u63a5\u53d7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7300B\u4e2a\u552f\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u534a\u6765\u81ea\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u901a\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6(GIFT-Eval)\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u975e\u5e38\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

The algorithm is designed starting from quadratic online problems but can be applied to general problems.

Selecting appropriate exogenous features is non-trivial and calls for a principled selection framework, given the direct operational implications for day-to-day planning and reliability. This work investigates whether causal feature selection can retain the most informative weather drivers while improving parsimony and robustness for short-term load forecasting. We present a case study on Southern Ontario with two open-source datasets: (i) IESO hourly electricity consumption by Forward Sortation Areas; (ii) ERA5 weather reanalysis data. We compare different feature selection regimes (no feature selection, non-causal selection, PCMCI-causal selection) on city-level forecasting with three different time series forecasting models: GRU, TCN, PatchTST. In the feature analysis, non-causal selection prioritizes radiation and moisture variables that show correlational dependence, whereas PCMCI-causal selection emphasizes more direct thermal drivers and prunes the indirect covariates.

A simplified, machine-actionable representation was developed to assess the similarity and separability of these disorders, but it is not suited for the most complex cases. Generating or applying a full binary matrix for similarity calculations is infeasible due to the vast number of symptom combinations. This research develops an alternative representation that links the narrative form of the DSM-5 with the binary matrix representation and enables automated generation of valid symptom combinations. Using a strict pre-defined format of lists, sets, and numbers with slight variations, complex diagnostic pathways involving numerous symptom combinations can be represented. This format, called the symptom profile generator (or simply generator), provides a readable, adaptable, and comprehensive alternative to a binary matrix while enabling easy generation of symptom combinations (profiles). Cognitive disorders, which typically involve multiple diagnostic criteria with several symptoms, can thus be expressed as lists of generators. Representing several psychotic disorders in generator form and generating all symptom combinations showed that matrix representations of complex disorders become too large to manage. The MPCS (maximum pairwise cosine similarity) algorithm cannot handle matrices of this size, prompting the development of a profile reduction method using targeted generator manipulation to find specific MPCS values between disorders. The generators allow easier creation of binary representations for large matrices and make it possible to calculate specific MPCS cases between complex disorders through conditional generators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u75c7\u72b6\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06DSM-5\u7684\u53d9\u8ff0\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5904\u7406\u6700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u6216\u5e94\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u7531\u4e8e\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5217\u8868\u3001\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u75c7\u72b6\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u8bca\u65ad\u8def\u5f84\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u6210\u5668\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\u7279\u5f81\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u79cd\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u6027\u969c\u788d\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6240\u6709\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u969c\u788d\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u53d8\u5f97\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5e9e\u5927\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\uff0cMPCS\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u77e9\u9635\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8bfb\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u969c\u788d\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5b9aMPCS\u503c\u3002"}}

However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance.

For many engineering systems, however, first-principles, model-based identification is impractical, motivating data-driven approaches for Digital Twins used in control and diagnostics. In this paper, we present RFE-DMDc, a supervised, data-driven workflow that uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select a minimal, physically meaningful set of variables to monitor and then derives a linear state-space model via Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc). The workflow includes a cross-subsystem selection step that mitigates feature \\textit{overshadowing} in multi-component systems. To corroborate the results, we implement a GA-DMDc baseline that jointly optimizes the state set and model fit under a common accuracy cost on states and outputs. Across a truth-known RLC benchmark and a realistic Integrated Energy System (IES) with multiple thermally coupled components and thousands of candidate variables, RFE-DMDc consistently recovers compact state sets (\\(\\approx 10\\) variables) that achieve test errors comparable to GA-DMDc while requiring an order of magnitude less computational time.

Despite this, existing approaches frequently perform naive fusion of multimodal inputs, overlooking key challenges such as modality-specific noise, missing modalities common in real-world scenarios, and the dynamically varying importance of each modality depending on the task. These limitations lead to suboptimal performance across several benchmark tasks. In this paper, we propose a robust multimodal fusion framework, TouchFormer. Specifically, we employ a Modality-Adaptive Gating (MAG) mechanism and intra- and inter-modality attention mechanisms to adaptively integrate cross-modal features, enhancing model robustness. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Instance Embedding Regularization(CER) strategy, which significantly improves classification accuracy in fine-grained subcategory material recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing non-visual methods, the proposed TouchFormer framework achieves classification accuracy improvements of 2.48% and 6.83% on SSMC and USMC tasks, respectively. Furthermore, real-world robotic experiments validate TouchFormer's effectiveness in enabling robots to better perceive and interpret their environment, paving the way for its deployment in safety-critical applications such as emergency response and industrial automation.

Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios. Through lossless speculative decoding experiments across models of various scales, we demonstrate that SpecFormer sets a new standard for scaling LLM inference with lower training demands and reduced computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpecFormer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5355\u5411\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u524d\u7f00\u6811\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u53ef\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u538b\u7f29\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f2\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u4f4e\u8c03\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpecFormer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5355\u5411\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6574\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u635f\u5931\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSpecFormer\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "SpecFormer\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6279\u5904\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A multi-agent simulation was developed in MATLAB to evaluate the fleet operations and to model demand arrival using a Poisson process under stochastic passenger flows and turnaround constraints.

We revisit two natural strategies for incorporating these weights: (i) embedding them into the local losses to retain a uniform weight (and thus a doubly stochastic matrix), and (ii) keeping the original losses while employing a $\u03bb$-induced row-stochastic matrix. Although prior work shows that both strategies yield the same expected descent direction for the global loss, it remains unclear whether the Euclidean-space guarantees are tight and what fundamentally differentiates their behaviors. To clarify this, we develop a weighted Hilbert-space framework $L^2(\u03bb;\\mathbb{R}^d)$ and obtain convergence rates that are strictly tighter than those from Euclidean analysis. In this geometry, the row-stochastic matrix becomes self-adjoint whereas the doubly stochastic one does not, creating additional penalty terms that amplify consensus error, thereby slowing convergence. Consequently, the difference in convergence arises not only from spectral gaps but also from these penalty terms. We then derive sufficient conditions under which the row-stochastic design converges faster even with a smaller spectral gap. Finally, by using a Rayleigh-quotient and Loewner-order eigenvalue comparison, we further obtain topology conditions that guarantee this advantage and yield practical topology-design guidelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cd\u6743\u91cd\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6536\u655b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u884c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5373\u4f7f\u8c31\u9699\u66f4\u5c0f\u4e5f\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u8282\u70b9\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5d4c\u5165\u672c\u5730\u635f\u5931vs\u4f7f\u7528\u884c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\uff09\u5728\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u671f\u671b\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u539f\u56e0\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u52a0\u6743\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6L\u00b2(\u03bb;\u211d\u1d48)\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Rayleigh\u5546\u548cLoewner\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\uff0c\u884c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u4f34\u7b97\u5b50\u800c\u53cc\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u4e0d\u662f\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u989d\u5916\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u653e\u5927\u5171\u8bc6\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u6162\u6536\u655b\u3002\u884c\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5373\u4f7f\u8c31\u9699\u66f4\u5c0f\u4e5f\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6536\u655b\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6765\u81ea\u8c31\u9699\uff0c\u8fd8\u6765\u81ea\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6bd4\u8f83\u83b7\u5f97\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u884c\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u62d3\u6251\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment.

Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Although existing unlearning methods can remove such knowledge, they fail to achieve benign forgetting because they often degrade the model's general image understanding performance. To address this, we propose the Sculpted Memory Forgetting Adapter (SMFA), which confines forgetting to targeted memory regions while preserving overall capabilities. SMFA first fine-tunes the model to replace sensitive responses with refusals, yielding a memory forgetting adapter, and then applies a retaining anchor-guided masking mechanism to prevent interference with unrelated knowledge and understanding ability. To systematically evaluate selective MLLM unlearning, we introduce S-MLLMUn Bench, the first benchmark designed to jointly assess the removal of sensitive knowledge and retention of general visual understanding. Extensive experiments show that, unlike prior methods, SMFA achieves precise and controllable unlearning while maintaining the model's foundational image understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SMFA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9057\u5fd8\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u951a\u70b9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u53ef\u63a7\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79fb\u9664\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u9057\u5fd8\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u606f\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "SMFA\u9996\u5148\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u654f\u611f\u54cd\u5e94\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u62d2\u7edd\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9057\u5fd8\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u4fdd\u7559\u951a\u70b9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u673a\u5236\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u5bf9\u65e0\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cSMFA\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SMFA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u79fb\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Together with manually refined prompts, this design improves tool call stability, execution reliability, and role-playing guidance. Second, in the GPU Track, we further adopt GRPO training, replacing supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning directly optimized by reward signals.

However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bSES\u3001MPD\u548cANLD\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6548\u7387\u6536\u76ca\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1)\u4f7f\u7528\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5206\u6570(SES)\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7528\uff0c(2)\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02(MPD)\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c(3)\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb(ANLD)\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bcd\u5e72\u8bcd\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u8bcd\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed(BNLTK)\u548c\u82f1\u8bed(Snowball)\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668SES\u6700\u9ad8(1.67)\u4f46ANLD\u8f83\u5dee(0.26)\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b\u82f1\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668SES\u9002\u4e2d(1.31)\u4f46ANLD\u8f83\u597d(0.14)\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6f5c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u6536\u76ca(\u9ad8SES)\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301(\u4f4eANLD)\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u3002"}}

In this paper we address the solution of learning problems using these satellite constellations. In particular, we focus on a federated approach, where satellites collect and locally process data, with the ground station aggregating local models. We focus on designing a novel, communication-efficient algorithm that still yields accurate trained models. To this end, we employ several mechanisms to reduce the number of communications with the ground station (local training) and their size (compression). We then propose an error feedback mechanism that enhances accuracy, which yields, as a byproduct, an algorithm-agnostic error feedback scheme that can be more broadly applied.

Two challenges, however, remain central: training generative models when no paired data exist, and evaluating stylistic text without relying only on human judgment. In this work, we present a framework for both generating and evaluating sentences in the style of 19th-century novelists. Large language models are fine-tuned with minimal, single-token prompts to produce text in the voices of authors such as Dickens, Austen, Twain, Alcott, and Melville. To assess these generative models, we employ a transformer-based detector trained on authentic sentences, using it both as a classifier and as a tool for stylistic explanation. We complement this with syntactic comparisons and explainable AI methods, including attention-based and gradient-based analyses, to identify the linguistic cues that drive stylistic imitation. Our findings show that the generated text reflects the authors' distinctive patterns and that AI-based evaluation offers a reliable alternative to human assessment.

Our method learns linear and nonlinear constraints from data or integrates expert-provided dependency graphs, ensuring counterfactuals are plausible and actionable. By maintaining consistency with feature relationships, the method produces explanations that align with real-world constraints. Additionally, it balances plausibility, diversity, and sparsity, effectively addressing key limitations in existing algorithms. The work is developed based on a real-life case study with Freshmail, the largest email marketing company in Poland and supported by a joint R&D project Sendguard. Furthermore, we provide an extensive evaluation using 140 public datasets, which highlights its ability to generate meaningful, domain-relevant counterfactuals that outperform other existing approaches based on widely used metrics.

However, constructing high-fidelity indoor RMs remains challenging due to the prohibitive latency of EM solvers and the limitations of learning-based methods, which often rely on sparse measurements or assumptions of homogeneous material, which are misaligned with the heterogeneous and multipath-rich nature of indoor environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose iRadioDiff, a sampling-free diffusion-based framework for indoor RM construction. iRadioDiff is conditioned on access point (AP) positions, and physics-informed prompt encoded by material reflection and transmission coefficients. It further incorporates multipath-critical priors, including diffraction points, strong transmission boundaries, and line-of-sight (LoS) contours, to guide the generative process via conditional channels and boundary-weighted objectives. This design enables accurate modeling of nonstationary field discontinuities and efficient construction of physically consistent RMs. Experiments demonstrate that iRadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor RM construction and received signal strength based indoor localization, which offers effective generalization across layouts and material configurations.

Existing approaches predominantly rely on parameter interpolation in weight space, which we show introduces significant distribution shift in the feature space and undermines task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose OTMF (Optimal Transport-based Masked Fusion), a novel model merging framework rooted in optimal transport theory to address the distribution shift that arises from naive parameter interpolation. Instead of directly aggregating features or weights, OTMF aligns the semantic geometry of task-specific models by discovering common masks applied to task vectors through optimal transport plans. These masks selectively extract transferable and task-agnostic components while preserving the unique structural identities of each task. To ensure scalability in real-world settings, OTMF further supports a continual fusion paradigm that incrementally integrates each new task vector without revisiting previous ones, maintaining a bounded memory footprint and enabling efficient fusion across a growing number of tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple vision and language benchmarks, and results show that OTMF achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $\u03c4^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models.

In a teacher-student setup, this translates into collecting a dataset of the teacher mapping -- querying the teacher -- and fitting a student to imitate such mapping. A sensible choice of queries is the dataset the teacher is trained on. But current methods fail when the teacher parameters are more numerous than the training data, because the student overfits to the queries instead of aligning its parameters to the teacher. In this work, we explore augmentation techniques to best sample the input-output mapping of a teacher network, with the goal of eliciting a rich set of representations from the teacher hidden layers. We discover that standard augmentations such as rotation, flipping, and adding noise, bring little to no improvement to the identification problem. We design new data augmentation techniques tailored to better sample the representational space of the network's hidden layers.

The manual analysis of student conversations to identify these discourse features is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which limits the scale and scope of studies. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate the automatic detection of these discourse features, offering educational researchers scalable and data-driven insights. However, existing studies in NLP that focus on discourse in dialogue rarely address educational data. In this work, we address this gap by introducing an annotated educational dialogue dataset of student conversations featuring knowledge construction and task production discourse. We also establish baseline models for automatically predicting these discourse properties for each turn of talk within conversations, using pre-trained large language models GPT-3.5 and Llama-3.1.

Learning their governing dynamics remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) provides a simple, data-driven approximation, but practical use is limited by sparse/noisy observations from continuous fields, reliance on linear approximations, and the lack of principled uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, we introduce Stochastic NODE-DMD, a probabilistic extension of DMD that models continuous-time, nonlinear dynamics while remaining interpretable. Our approach enables continuous spatiotemporal reconstruction at arbitrary coordinates and quantifies predictive uncertainty. Across four benchmarks, a synthetic setting and three physics-based flows, it surpasses a baseline in reconstruction accuracy when trained from only 10% observation density. It further recovers the dynamical structure by aligning learned modes and continuous-time eigenvalues with ground truth. Finally, on datasets with multiple realizations, our method learns a calibrated distribution over latent dynamics that preserves ensemble variability rather than averaging across regimes.

We recast LMI as reusing the LLM's own latent space and propose the Invariant Latent Space Hypothesis (ILSH): (1) diverse outputs from the same source prompt should preserve consistent semantics (source invariance), and (2) input<->output cyclic mappings should be self-consistent within a shared latent space (cyclic invariance). Accordingly, we present Inv^2A, which treats the LLM as an invariant decoder and learns only a lightweight inverse encoder that maps outputs to a denoised pseudo-representation. When multiple outputs are available, they are sparsely concatenated at the representation layer to increase information density. Training proceeds in two stages: contrastive alignment (source invariance) and supervised reinforcement (cyclic invariance). An optional training-free neighborhood search can refine local performance. Across 9 datasets covering user and system prompt scenarios, Inv^2A outperforms baselines by an average of 4.77% BLEU score while reducing dependence on large inverse corpora.

Evaluating large language models' (LLMs) alignment typically involves directly assessing their open-ended responses, requiring human annotators or strong LLM judges. Conversely, LLMs themselves have also been extensively evaluated as judges for assessing alignment. In this work, we examine the relationship between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities in aligning with human preferences. To this end, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the generation-evaluation consistency (GE-consistency) among various LLMs, revealing a strong correlation between their generation and evaluation capabilities when evaluated by a strong LLM preference oracle. Utilizing this finding, we propose a benchmarking paradigm that measures LLM alignment with human preferences without directly evaluating their generated outputs, instead assessing LLMs in their role as evaluators. Our evaluation shows that our proposed benchmark, AlignEval, matches or surpasses widely used automatic LLM evaluation benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, in capturing human preferences when ranking LLMs. Our study offers valuable insights into the connection between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities, and introduces a benchmark that assesses alignment without directly evaluating model outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAlignEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u95f4\u63a5\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u6392\u540dLLM\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5f3aLLM\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u5404\u79cdLLM\u7684\u751f\u6210-\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faAlignEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u95f4\u63a5\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "AlignEval\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u6355\u83b7\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6392\u540dLLM\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86AlpacaEval\u548cArena-Hard\u7b49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0cAlignEval\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u80fd\u529b\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We present NNGPT, an open-source framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, primarily for computer vision. Unlike previous frameworks, NNGPT extends the dataset of neural networks by generating new models, enabling continuous fine-tuning of LLMs based on closed-loop system of generation, assessment, and self-improvement. It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78. The system has already generated over 5K validated models, proving NNGPT as an autonomous AutoML engine. Upon acceptance, the code, prompts, and checkpoints will be released for public access to enable reproducibility and facilitate community usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "NNGPT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u6539\u8fdbAutoML\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210-\u8bc4\u4f30-\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u662fAI\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ed\u73af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u4e94\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u7684LLM\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u67b6\u6784\u5408\u6210\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684PyTorch\u5757\u5408\u6210\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eLEMUR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "NN-RAG\u57281,289\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523073%\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6027\uff1b3-shot\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u5e38\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u54c8\u5e0c\u53bb\u91cd\u8282\u7701\u6570\u767e\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\uff1b\u5355\u6b21\u9884\u6d4b\u5339\u914d\u641c\u7d22\u5f0fAutoML\uff1bHPO\u5728LEMUR\u4e0aRMSE 0.60\u4f18\u4e8eOptuna\uff1b\u4ee3\u7801\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u5668RMSE 0.14\uff0cPearson r=0.78\uff1b\u5df2\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u8fc75K\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "NNGPT\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684AutoML\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u793e\u533a\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference.

Inspired by the foundation model recipe (large-scale pretraining followed by light RL) we ask whether a single agent can be trained on hundreds of tasks with online interaction. To accelerate research in this direction, we introduce a new benchmark with 200 diverse tasks spanning many domains and embodiments, each with language instructions, demonstrations, and optionally image observations.

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world.

In this paper, we propose DRAFT-RL, a novel framework that integrates Chain-of-Draft (CoD) reasoning into multi-agent RL training. Instead of generating single responses, each agent produces multiple drafts per query, which are then evaluated by peer agents and a learned reward model to identify the most promising trajectory.

Beginning with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique, numerous reasoning methods have emerged that decompose problems into smaller, sequential steps (or thoughts). However, existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving and do not necessarily generate creative solutions by ``creative reasoning''. In domains where the solution space is expansive and conventional solutions are suboptimal, such as drug discovery or business strategization, creative reasoning to discover innovative solutions is crucial. To address this gap, first we introduce a computational framework for creative reasoning inspired by established cognitive science principles. With this framework, we propose three core creative reasoning paradigms, namely, \\textit{combinational}, \\textit{exploratory}, and \\textit{transformative} reasoning, where each offers specific directions for systematic exploration of the universe of thoughts to generate creative solutions. Next, to materialize this framework using LLMs, we introduce the \\textit{Universe of Thoughts} (or \\textit{UoT}, for short), a novel set of methods to implement the aforementioned three creative processes. Finally, we introduce three novel tasks that necessitate creative problem-solving, along with an evaluation benchmark to assess creativity from three orthogonal perspectives: feasibility as constraint, and utility and novelty as metrics. With a comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning techniques as well as representative commercial models with reasoning capability, we show that UoT demonstrates superior performance in creative reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6UoT\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u5f0f\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u5f0f\u4e09\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5e38\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u521b\u9020\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5728\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u5546\u4e1a\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u5f0f\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u5f0f\u4e09\u79cd\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u601d\u60f3\u5b87\u5b99\u6765\u751f\u6210\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cUoT\u5728\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UoT\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLMs\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Existing neural models often struggle to represent these interacting dynamics, leading to unstable predictions and reduced reliability in downstream applications. This work introduces a forecast-blur-denoise framework that improves temporal fidelity through structured noise modeling. The approach incorporates a learnable Gaussian Process module that generates smooth, correlated perturbations, encouraging the forecasting backbone to capture long-range structure while a dedicated refinement model restores high-resolution temporal detail. Training the components jointly enables natural competence division and avoids the artifacts commonly produced by isotropic corruption methods. Experiments across electricity, traffic, and solar datasets show consistent gains in multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The modular design also allows the blur-denoise layer to operate as a lightweight enhancement for pretrained models, supporting efficient adaptation in limited-data scenarios.

However, synthetic traffic is not inherently privacy-preserving, and the extent to which it leaks sensitive information, and how to measure such leakage, remain largely unexplored. This challenge is further compounded by the diversity of model architectures, which shape how traffic is represented and synthesized. We introduce a comprehensive set of privacy metrics for synthetic network traffic, combining standard approaches like membership inference attacks (MIA) and data extraction attacks with network-specific identifiers and attributes. Using these metrics, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of different representative generative models and examine the factors that influence attack success. Our results reveal substantial variability in privacy risks across models and datasets.

While fragment-based models handle limited data better than atom-based approaches, existing heuristic fragmentation limits diversity and misses key fragments. Additionally, model tuning typically requires slow, indirect collaboration between medicinal chemists and AI engineers. We introduce FRAGMENTA, an end-to-end framework for drug lead optimization comprising: 1) a novel generative model that reframes fragmentation as a \"vocabulary selection\" problem, using dynamic Q-learning to jointly optimize fragmentation and generation; and 2) an agentic AI system that refines objectives via conversational feedback from domain experts. This system removes the AI engineer from the loop and progressively learns domain knowledge to eventually automate tuning. In real-world cancer drug discovery experiments, FRAGMENTA's Human-Agent configuration identified nearly twice as many high-scoring molecules as baselines.

Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. While year-by-year multiple-choice performance also favored DeepSeek-R1, this performance gap did not reach statistical significance in any specific unit-year (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated robust alignment with the structural and semantic demands of the pharmacist licensure exam. These findings suggest that domain-specific models warrant further investigation for this context, while also reinforcing the necessity of human oversight in legally and ethically sensitive contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86ChatGPT-4o\u548cDeepSeek-R1\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u836f\u5e08\u8d44\u683c\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DeepSeek-R1\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eChatGPT-4o\uff0890.0% vs 76.1%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u836f\u5e08\u8d44\u683c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282017-2021\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fd\u836f\u5e08\u8d44\u683c\u8003\u8bd5\u76842,306\u9053\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u542b\u8868\u683c\u6216\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u9898\u76ee\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u4e2d\u6587\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "result": "DeepSeek-R1\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8eChatGPT-4o\uff0890.0% vs 76.1%, p < 0.001\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7efc\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u5176\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepSeek-R1\u5728\u836f\u5e08\u8d44\u683c\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u9700\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

While all tested models were susceptible to emergent misalignment, some models showed more resistance than others. Specifically the Qwen-2.5 family proved to be relatively resistant, while GPT-4o exhibited the strongest misalignment. In this paper we evaluate if current-generation open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to the Qwen-2.5 family and measure misalignment robustness over a range of model architectures and scales.\n  We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters). Models fine-tuned on insecure code generation show a 0.68% misalignment rate (compared to 0.07% for base models), matching the lower end of prior open-model results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%.\n  We identify a critical format-dependent vulnerability: requiring JSON output doubles misalignment rates compared to natural language prompts (0.96% vs 0.42%). This suggests that structural constraints may bypass safety training by reducing the model's 'degrees of freedom' to refuse.

However, prior work on large-scale time series models has predominantly focused on forecasting, leaving a critical gap for versatile, fine-tuning-free classification. To address this, we introduce TiCT (Time-series in-Context Transformer), a transformer-based model pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data to perform in-context classification. We make two primary technical contributions: 1) a novel architecture featuring a scalable bit-based label encoding and a special output attention mechanism to handle an arbitrary number of classes; and 2) a synthetic pre-training framework that combines a Mixup-inspired process with data augmentation to foster generalization and noise invariance.

In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces.

However, this often introduces large errors due to outliers in the weights. Proposed mitigation mechanisms include applying adaptive rounding, random rotation transformations or committing to a post-training target using calibration data. Unfortunately, this reliance on calibration data can be severely limiting in some real-world scenarios as such data may be unavailable or subject to privacy regulations. In this paper, we propose algorithms to optimize transformations and adaptive rounding without access to any calibration data. The optimization is achieved by designing a suitable proxy function for the quantization loss without calibration data. To maintain inference efficiency, we perform structured matrix transformations for single matrices. For paired weights that interact directly in the computation graph, we use dual matrix transformations and adaptive rounding methods.

Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture uncertainty or the reliability of model predictions, particularly under adversarial or degraded conditions. This paper introduces the \\emph{Parallel Trust Assessment System (PaTAS)}, a framework for modeling and propagating trust in neural networks using Subjective Logic (SL). PaTAS operates in parallel with standard neural computation through \\emph{Trust Nodes} and \\emph{Trust Functions} that propagate input, parameter, and activation trust across the network. The framework defines a \\emph{Parameter Trust Update} mechanism to refine parameter reliability during training and an \\emph{Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA)} method to compute instance-specific trust at inference. Experiments on real-world and adversarial datasets demonstrate that PaTAS produces interpretable, symmetric, and convergent trust estimates that complement accuracy and expose reliability gaps in poisoned, biased, or uncertain data scenarios. The results show that PaTAS effectively distinguishes between benign and adversarial inputs and identifies cases where model confidence diverges from actual reliability. By enabling transparent and quantifiable trust reasoning within neural architectures, PaTAS provides a principled foundation for evaluating model reliability across the AI lifecycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PaTAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u89c2\u903b\u8f91\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u4fe1\u4efb\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5982\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6216\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u4efb\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u884c\u4f20\u64ad\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53c2\u6570\u4fe1\u4efb\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePaTAS\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u826f\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "PaTAS\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this work, we study the geometry of hidden representations in LLMs through the lens of \\textit{intrinsic dimension} (ID), focusing specifically on decision-making dynamics in a multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) setting. We perform a large-scale study, with 28 open-weight transformer models and estimate ID across layers using multiple estimators, while also quantifying per-layer performance on MCQA tasks. Our findings reveal a consistent ID pattern across models: early layers operate on low-dimensional manifolds, middle layers expand this space, and later layers compress it again, converging to decision-relevant representations.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches.

Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes. Overall, SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f6f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u95e8\u66ff\u4ee3\u786c\u88c1\u526a\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GSPO\u548cGRPO\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u786c\u88c1\u526a\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "SAPO\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u95e8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u8870\u51cf\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u7528\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSAPO\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684Pass@1\u6027\u80fd\u3002Qwen3-VL\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e5f\u663e\u793aSAPO\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0a\u5747\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SAPO\u4e3aLLMs\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The opacity of AI systems, combined with the semantic gap between high-level requirements and low-level network representations, creates barriers to traditional verification approaches. These AI-specific challenges are amplified by longstanding issues in Requirements Engineering, including ambiguity in natural language specifications and scalability bottlenecks in formalization. We propose an approach that leverages AI itself to address these challenges through two complementary components.

Work in progress", "summary": "Data attribution seeks to trace model behavior back to the training examples that shaped it, enabling debugging, auditing, and data valuation at scale. Classical influence-function methods offer a principled foundation but remain impractical for modern networks because they require expensive backpropagation or Hessian inversion at inference. We propose a data attribution method that preserves the same first-order counterfactual target while eliminating per-query backward passes. Our approach simulates each training example's parameter influence through short-horizon gradient propagation during training and later reads out attributions for any query using only forward evaluations. This design shifts computation from inference to simulation, reflecting real deployment regimes where a model may serve billions of user queries but originate from a fixed, finite set of data sources (for example, a large language model trained on diverse corpora while compensating a specific publisher such as the New York Times). Empirically, on standard MLP benchmarks, our estimator matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines such as TRAK on standard attribution metrics (LOO and LDS) while offering orders-of-magnitude lower inference cost.

However, their practical deployment is severely hampered by substantial static memory overhead, as all experts must be loaded into memory. Existing post-training pruning methods, while reducing model size, often derive their pruning criteria from a single, general-purpose corpus. This leads to a critical limitation: a catastrophic performance degradation when the pruned model is applied to other domains, necessitating a costly re-pruning for each new domain. To address this generalization gap, we introduce Mosaic Pruning (MoP). The core idea of MoP is to construct a functionally comprehensive set of experts through a structured ``cluster-then-select\" process. This process leverages a similarity metric that captures expert performance across different task domains to functionally cluster the experts, and subsequently selects the most representative expert from each cluster based on our proposed Activation Variability Score. Unlike methods that optimize for a single corpus, our proposed Mosaic Pruning ensures that the pruned model retains a functionally complementary set of experts, much like the tiles of a mosaic that together form a complete picture of the original model's capabilities, enabling it to handle diverse downstream tasks.Extensive experiments on various MoE models demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

GED is determined by an optimal alignment between a pair of graphs that partitions each into aligned (zero-cost) and unaligned (cost-incurring) substructures. Due to NP-hard nature of exact GED computation, GED approximations based on Graph Neural Network(GNN) have emerged. Existing GNN-based GED approaches typically learn node embeddings for each graph and then aggregate pairwise node similarities to estimate the final similarity. Despite their effectiveness, we identify a mismatch between this prevalent node-centric matching paradigm and the core principles of GED. This discrepancy leads to two critical limitations: (1) a failure to capture the global structural correspondence for optimal alignment, and (2) a misattribution of edit costs driven by spurious node level signals. To address these limitations, we propose GCGSim, a GED-consistent graph similarity learning framework centering on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs. Specifically, we make three core technical contributions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GCGSim achieves state-of-the-art performance.

While FL supports low-latency parallel training, it may converge to less accurate model. In contrast, SL achieves higher accuracy through sequential training but suffers from increased delay. To leverage the advantages of both, hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) allows some devices to operate in FL mode and others in SL mode. This paper aims to accelerate HSFL by addressing three key questions: 1) How does learning mode selection affect overall learning performance? 2) How does it interact with batch size? 3) How can these hyperparameters be jointly optimized alongside communication and computational resources to reduce overall learning delay? We first analyze convergence, revealing the interplay between learning mode and batch size. Next, we formulate a delay minimization problem and propose a two-stage solution: a block coordinate descent method for a relaxed problem to obtain a locally optimal solution, followed by a rounding algorithm to recover integer batch sizes with near-optimal performance.

Prior work has proposed a range of heuristics to counteract this effect, but these methods are ad hoc: they frequently trade off correctness for diversity, their effectiveness varies across tasks, and in some cases they even contradict one another. In this work, we place these observations on a rigorous foundation. We first provide a formal proof of why RL fine-tuning exhibits diversity collapse via a selection and reinforcement bias. Next, we make a key observation that any reward modification to address diversity collapse only needs to be applied on the correct trajectories. Building directly on this analysis, we introduce a principled method -- \\textit{differential smoothing} -- that provably improves both correctness and diversity, outperforming vanilla RL as well as widely used entropy-based heuristics.

HSTAN employs a decoupled architecture (Graph Attention Network for spatial, cascaded GRU with self-attention for temporal) to achieve superior performance and efficiency, requiring only 12.3 ms inference time (73% faster than Transformer methods) and reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) to 0.73m (42.2% better than Social_LSTM) on the NGSIM dataset. Furthermore, Conformalized Quantile Regression enhances reliability by generating prediction intervals (91.3% coverage at 90% confidence), which the DTRA module then converts into timely warnings via a physics-informed risk potential function and an adaptive threshold mechanism inspired by statistical process control.Tested across multi-scenario datasets, the complete system demonstrates high efficacy, achieving an F1 score of 0.912, a low false alarm rate of 8.2%, and an ample warning lead time of 2.8 seconds, validating the framework's superior performance and practical deployment feasibility in complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u524d\u5411\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u8b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u98ce\u9669\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u524d\u5411\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u9608\u503c\u9884\u8b66\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HSTAN\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ea7\u8054GRU\u4e0e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u5e8f\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4fdd\u5f62\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u98ce\u9669\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8b66\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728NGSIM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u970012.3\u6beb\u79d2\uff08\u6bd4Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb73%\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u81f30.73\u7c73\uff08\u6bd4Social_LSTM\u63d0\u534742.2%\uff09\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u8fbe\u523091.3%\uff0890%\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edfF1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a0.912\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u73878.2%\uff0c\u9884\u8b66\u63d0\u524d\u65f6\u95f42.8\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate this problem of prompt fairness: specifically, the phrasing of a prompt by different users/styles, despite the same question being asked in principle, may elicit different responses from an LLM. To quantify this disparity, we propose to use information-theoretic metrics that can capture two dimensions of bias: subgroup sensitivity, the variability of responses within a subgroup and cross group consistency, the variability of responses across subgroups. Our analysis reveals that certain subgroups exhibit both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others. Our empirical analysis reveals that certain demographic sub groups experience both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others, indicating structural inequities in model behavior. To mitigate these disparities, we propose practical interventions, including majority voting across multiple generations and prompt neutralization, which together improve response stability and enhance fairness across user populations. In the experiments, we observe clear prompt sensitivity disparities across demographic subgroups: before mitigation, cross-group divergence values reach 0.28 and typically fall in the from 0.14 to 0.22 range. After applying our neutralization and multi generation strategy, these divergences consistently decrease, with the largest gap reduced to 0.22 and many distances falling to 0.17 or below, indicating more stable and consistent outputs across subgroups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237/\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6027\u5316\u7b49\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u6539\u5584\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8be2\u95ee\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5b50\u7ec4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u7ec4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6027\u5316\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u524d\u8de8\u7ec4\u5dee\u5f02\u503c\u8fbe\u52300.28\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u57280.14-0.22\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6027\u5316\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\u540e\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\u964d\u81f30.22\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u81f30.17\u6216\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b50\u7ec4\u95f4\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

Recently, federated block coordinate descent scheme has become a popular option in training large-scale models, as it allows clients to train only a subset of the model locally instead of the entire model. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), even a single block can contain a significant number of parameters, posing substantial communication latency, particularly for resource-constrained clients.

However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity.

In real graphs, nodes often tend to form tightly-knit communities/clusters, which embody abundant signals for compensating label scarcity in semi-supervised node classification but are not explored in prior methods.\n  Inspired by this, this paper presents NCGC that integrates self-supervised graph clustering and semi-supervised classification into a unified framework. Firstly, we theoretically unify the optimization objectives of GNNs and spectral graph clustering, and based on that, develop soft orthogonal GNNs (SOGNs) that leverage a refined message passing paradigm to generate node representations for both classification and clustering. On top of that, NCGC includes a self-supervised graph clustering module that enables the training of SOGNs for learning representations of unlabeled nodes in a self-supervised manner. Particularly, this component comprises two non-trivial clustering objectives and a Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization that transforms predicted cluster assignments into balanced soft pseudo-labels. Through combining the foregoing clustering module with the classification model using a multi-task objective containing the supervised classification loss on labeled data and self-supervised clustering loss on unlabeled data, NCGC promotes synergy between them and achieves enhanced model capacity.

In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calder\u00f3n problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE.

Our comprehensive experiments showcase that DDSM consistently and considerably outperforms 15 strong baselines on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DDSM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e94\u529b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfMPNN\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(MPNN)\u7531\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e94\u529b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u8ddd\u79bb\u6307\u5bfc\u65b0\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "DDSM\u572815\u4e2a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "DDSM\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MPNN\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We show that whenever similarity between concepts can be expressed as monotone witness overlap -- whether arising from graph neighborhoods, causal relations, temporal structure, topological features, symbolic patterns, or embedding-based neighborhoods -- it admits a reduction to compact encodings with provable ranking preservation guarantees. REWA systems consist of: (1) finite witness sets $W(v)$, (2) semi-random bit assignments generated from each witness, and (3) monotonicity of expected similarity in the overlap $\u0394(u, v) = |W(u) \\cap W(v)|$. We prove that under an overlap-gap condition on the final witness sets -- independent of how they were constructed -- top-$k$ rankings are preserved using $m = O(\\log(|V|/\u03b4))$ bits. The witness-set formulation is compositional: any sequence of structural, temporal, causal, topological, information-theoretic, or learned transformations can be combined into pipelines that terminate in discrete witness sets. The theory applies to the final witness overlap, enabling modular construction of similarity systems from reusable primitives. This yields a vast design space: millions of composable similarity definitions inherit logarithmic encoding complexity. REWA subsumes and unifies Bloom filters, minhash, LSH bitmaps, random projections, sketches, and hierarchical filters as special cases. It provides a principled foundation for similarity systems whose behavior is governed by witness overlap rather than hash-function engineering.

We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning. These results highlight the strong potential of pretrained time-series foundation models to serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cSundial\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b8c\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LSTM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u8db3\u591f\u957f\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u8d85\u8fc71-2\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u5b63\u8282\u5468\u671f\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u53f6\u7247\u9762\u79ef\u6307\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528HiQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u7f8e\u56fd\uff0c2000-2022\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u7edf\u8ba1\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u5168\u76d1\u7763LSTM\u548cSundial\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "Sundial\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f53\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u8986\u76d6\u8d85\u8fc71-2\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u5b63\u8282\u5468\u671f\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b8c\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u9065\u611f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Clustering over such data finds numerous practical applications in real scenarios, including social community detection, medical data analytics, etc. However, as revealed by our empirical studies, existing multi-view clustering solutions largely rely on the high correlation between attributes across various views and overlook the unique characteristics (e.g., low modality-wise correlation and intense feature-wise noise) of multimodal attributes output by large pre-trained language and vision models in MMAGs, leading to suboptimal clustering performance.\n  Inspired by foregoing empirical observations and our theoretical analyses with graph signal processing, we propose the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, which innovatively incorporates a feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning, thereby effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional graph filters adopted in the extant multi-view graph clustering approaches. On top of that, DGF includes a tri-cross contrastive training strategy that employs instance-level contrastive learning across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities for learning robust and discriminative node representations.

The difficulty lies in identifying subtle anomaly precursors concealed within normal signals. However, existing unsupervised methods, trained exclusively on normal data, demonstrate a fundamental propensity to reconstruct normal patterns. Consequently, when confronted with weak precursors, their predictions are dominated by the normal pattern, submerging the very signal required for prediction. To contend with the limitation, we propose RED-F, a Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting framework, comprising the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). The REM utilizes a hybrid time-frequency mechanism to mitigate the precursor, generating a purified, normal-pattern baseline. The DFM then receives this purified baseline and the original sequence which retains the precursor as parallel inputs. At the core of our framework, RED-F employs a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult task of absolute signal detection into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictive streams. This contrastive mechanism serves to amplify the faint precursor signal. Furthermore, the DFM is trained with a novel Multi-Series Prediction (MSP) objective, which leverages distant future context to enhance its predictive sensitivity. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior capability of RED-F in anomaly prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RED-F\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u6d88\u9664\u548c\u53cc\u6d41\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u653e\u5927\u5fae\u5f31\u5f02\u5e38\u524d\u5146\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u91cd\u6784\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f53\u9762\u5bf9\u5fae\u5f31\u5f02\u5e38\u524d\u5146\u65f6\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u88ab\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u6df9\u6ca1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "RED-F\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u6784\u6d88\u9664\u6a21\u578b(REM)\u548c\u53cc\u6d41\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b(DFM)\u3002REM\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65f6\u9891\u673a\u5236\u6d88\u9664\u524d\u5146\u751f\u6210\u7eaf\u51c0\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cDFM\u63a5\u6536\u7eaf\u51c0\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u524d\u5146\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRED-F\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5353\u8d8a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RED-F\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u6d88\u9664\u548c\u53cc\u6d41\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5fae\u5f31\u5f02\u5e38\u524d\u5146\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u7edd\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation.

Utilizing a comprehensive set of 69 predictors -- encompassing market, behavioral, and macroeconomic indicators -- we evaluate the performance of LGBM-based models and compare them with both econometric and machine learning baselines. For probabilistic forecasting, we explore two quantile-based approaches: direct quantile regression using the pinball loss function, and a residual simulation method that transforms point forecasts into predictive distributions. To identify the main drivers of volatility, we employ gain-based and permutation feature importance techniques, consistently highlighting the significance of trading volume, lagged volatility measures, investor attention, and market capitalization.

Building on the concept of tensor flow divergence, which quantifies how information is transformed across network layers, we develop a two-stage optimization process. The first stage employs iterative divergence-aware pruning to identify and remove redundant filters while preserving critical information pathways. The second stage extends this principle to higher-level architecture optimization by analyzing layer-wise contributions to information propagation and selectively eliminating entire layers that demonstrate minimal impact on network performance. The proposed method naturally adapts to diverse architectures, including convolutional networks, transformers, and hybrid designs, providing a consistent metric for comparing the structural importance across different layer types. Experimental validation across multiple modern architectures and datasets reveals that this combined approach achieves substantial model compression while maintaining competitive accuracy. The presented approach achieves parameter reduction results that are globally comparable to those of state-of-the-art solutions and outperforms them across a wide range of modern neural network architectures, from convolutional models to transformers.

This is particularly appealing in Federated Learning (FL), where momentum intuitively appears as a solution to mitigate the effects of statistical heterogeneity. Despite recent progress in this direction, it is still unclear if momentum can guarantee convergence under unbounded heterogeneity in decentralized scenarios, where only some workers participate at each round. In this work we analyze momentum under cyclic client participation, and theoretically prove that it remains inevitably affected by statistical heterogeneity. Similarly to SGD, we prove that decreasing step-sizes do not help either: in fact, any schedule decreasing faster than $\u0398\\left(1/t\\right)$ leads to convergence to a constant value that depends on the initialization and the heterogeneity bound.

Accepted at AAAI 2026", "summary": "Discovering subgroups with the maximum average treatment effect is crucial for targeted decision making in domains such as precision medicine, public policy, and education. While most prior work is formulated in the potential outcome framework, the corresponding structural causal model (SCM) for this task has been largely overlooked. In practice, two approaches dominate. The first estimates pointwise conditional treatment effects and then fits a tree on those estimates, effectively turning subgroup estimation into the harder problem of accurate pointwise estimation. The second constructs decision trees or rule sets with ad-hoc 'causal' heuristics, typically without rigorous justification for why a given heuristic may be used or whether such heuristics are necessary at all. We address these issues by studying the problem directly under the SCM framework. Under the assumption of a partition-based model, we show that optimal subgroup discovery reduces to recovering the data-generating models and hence a standard supervised learning problem (regression or classification). This allows us to adopt any partition-based methods to learn the subgroup from data. We instantiate the approach with CART, arguably one of the most widely used tree-based methods, to learn the subgroup with maximum treatment effect. Finally, on a large collection of synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we compare our method against a wide range of baselines and find that our approach, which avoids such causal heuristics, more accurately identifies subgroups with maximum treatment effect.

In these tasks, models solve the target problems by inferring compositional rules from context examples, which are composed of basic components structured by underlying rules. However, some of these tasks remain challenging for Transformers, which are not inherently designed to handle compositional tasks and offer limited structural inductive bias. In this work, inspired by the principle of sparse coding, we propose a reformulation of the attention to enhance its capability for compositional tasks. In sparse coding, data are represented as sparse combinations of dictionary atoms with coefficients that capture their compositional rules. Specifically, we reinterpret the attention block as a mapping of inputs into outputs through projections onto two sets of learned dictionary atoms: an encoding dictionary and a decoding dictionary. The encoding dictionary decomposes the input into a set of coefficients, which represent the compositional structure of the input. To enhance structured representations, we impose sparsity on these coefficients. The sparse coefficients are then used to linearly combine the decoding dictionary atoms to generate the output.

While Graph Condensation (GC) offers a promising solution by synthesizing smaller datasets, existing methods falter in the multimodal setting. We identify a dual challenge causing this failure: (1) conflicting gradients arising from semantic misalignments between modalities, and (2) the GNN's message-passing architecture pathologically amplifying this gradient noise across the graph structure. To address this, we propose Structurally-Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a novel condensation framework tailored for multimodal graphs. SR-GM introduces two synergistic components: first, a gradient decoupling mechanism that resolves inter-modality conflicts at their source via orthogonal projection; and second, a structural damping regularizer that acts directly on the gradient field. By leveraging the graph's Dirichlet energy, this regularizer transforms the topology from a noise amplifier into a stabilizing force during optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SR-GM significantly improves accuracy and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that addressing both gradient conflict and structural amplification in tandem is essential for achieving superior performance. Moreover, the condensed multimodal graphs exhibit strong cross-architecture generalization and promise to accelerate applications like Neural Architecture Search.

While pseudo-labeling has become a dominant strategy in SSMLL, most existing methods assign equal weights to all pseudo-labels regardless of their quality, which can amplify the impact of noisy or uncertain predictions and degrade the overall performance. In this paper, we theoretically verify that the optimal weight for a pseudo-label should reflect its correctness likelihood. Empirically, we observe that on the same dataset, the correctness likelihood distribution of unlabeled data remains stable, even as the number of labeled training samples varies. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling (DiCaP), a correctness-aware framework that estimates posterior precision to calibrate pseudo-label weights. We further introduce a dual-thresholding mechanism to separate confident and ambiguous regions: confident samples are pseudo-labeled and weighted accordingly, while ambiguous ones are explored by unsupervised contrastive learning.

We identify a key cause of this performance gap: adaptivity in pre-conditioners, which limits the optimizer's ability to adapt to diverse optimization landscapes. To address this, we propose Anon (Adaptivity Non-restricted Optimizer with Novel convergence technique), a novel optimizer with continuously tunable adaptivity\n  , allowing it to interpolate between SGD-like and Adam-like behaviors and even extrapolate beyond both. To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks. These results demonstrate that adaptivity can serve as a valuable tunable design principle, and Anon provides the first unified and reliable framework capable of bridging the gap between classical and modern optimizers and surpassing their advantageous properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Anon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u5728SGD\u548cAdam\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\u751a\u81f3\u5916\u63a8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982Adam\uff09\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5982\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SGD\uff09\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u9884\u8c03\u8282\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u73af\u5883\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAnon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0SGD\u548cAdam\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u5916\u63a8\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u589e\u91cf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u65b0\uff08IDU\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6bd4AMSGrad\u7684\u786c\u6700\u5927\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cAnon\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0cAnon\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5f25\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

The first method is a regression based technique that predicts normalized RD costs of a given Coding Unit (CU). As partitioning possesses the Markov property, the associated decision-making problem can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Version identical to the camera-ready paper", "summary": "Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are widely used for learning on graphs, but their ability to process long-range information is limited by the phenomenon of oversquashing. This limitation has led some researchers to advocate Graph Transformers as a better alternative, whereas others suggest that it can be mitigated within the MPNN framework, using virtual nodes or other rewiring techniques.\n  In this work, we demonstrate that oversquashing is not limited to long-range tasks, but can also arise in short-range problems. This observation allows us to disentangle two distinct mechanisms underlying oversquashing: (1) the bottleneck phenomenon, which can arise even in low-range settings, and (2) the vanishing gradient phenomenon, which is closely associated with long-range tasks.\n  We further show that the short-range bottleneck effect is not captured by existing explanations for oversquashing, and that adding virtual nodes does not resolve it. In contrast, transformers do succeed in such tasks, positioning them as the more compelling solution to oversquashing, compared to specialized MPNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "MPNNs\u5728\u56fe\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u662f\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6709\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e5f\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u74f6\u9888\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u865a\u62df\u8282\u70b9\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u800cTransformer\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5904\u7406\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3aMPNNs\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u4e3b\u8981\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u4efb\u52a1\u540c\u6837\u5b58\u5728\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c06\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83MPNNs\u3001\u5e26\u865a\u62df\u8282\u70b9\u7684MPNNs\u4ee5\u53caTransformer\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u74f6\u9888\u73b0\u8c61\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u865a\u62df\u8282\u70b9\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800cTransformer\u5728\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e13\u95e8\u7684MPNNs\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms. We benchmark MoRE against established baselines, including scGPT, scVI, and Harmony with scArches, evaluating integration fidelity, rare population detection, and modality transfer.

TTX contamination leads to food safety risks and economic losses, making early prediction of TTX contamination vital to the food industry and competent authorities.

However, the temporal relationships between abiotic factors, biotic factors, and TTX contamination remain unexplored.\n  We have developed an explainable, deep learning-based model to predict TTX contamination in the Dutch Zeeland estuary.

Existing evaluations primarily assess unimodal, decontextualized question-answering, overlooking multi-agent decision-making environments such as Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs). MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time. Current benchmarks lack this longitudinal and multimodal complexity. We introduce MTBBench, an agentic benchmark simulating MTB-style decision-making through clinically challenging, multimodal, and longitudinal oncology questions. Ground truth annotations are validated by clinicians via a co-developed app, ensuring clinical relevance. We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities. To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively. Overall, MTBBench offers a challenging and realistic testbed for advancing multimodal LLM reasoning, reliability, and tool-use with a focus on MTB environments in precision oncology.", "AI": {"tldr": "MTBBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u5b50\u80bf\u7624\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u80bf\u7624\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5206\u5b50\u80bf\u7624\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8fd9\u79cd\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u548c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1MTBBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e34\u5e8a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e34\u5e8a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u534f\u8c03\u51b2\u7a81\u8bc1\u636e\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6846\u67b6\u540e\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e869.0%\u548c11.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "MTBBench\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u7cbe\u51c6\u80bf\u7624\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Traditional machine learning detectors struggle with class imbalance, high dimensional features, and scarce real world traces. They often lack transferability-performing well in the training domain but degrading in novel attack scenarios. We propose a hybrid transfer framework that integrates Transfer Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), contrastive learning, and Siamese networks to improve cross-domain generalization. An attention-based autoencoder supports knowledge transfer across domains, while Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) select stable, informative features to reduce dimensionality and computational cost. A Siamese encoder trained with a contrastive objective aligns source and target representations, increasing anomaly separability and mitigating feature drift.

Typically framed as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, stellarator design is a time-consuming process that can take hours to solve on a computing cluster. Developing fast methods for designing stellarators is crucial for advancing fusion research. Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target. Beyond the case study, we share multiple promising avenues for generative modeling to advance stellarator design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7406\u60f3\u7279\u6027\u7684\u51c6\u5bf9\u79f0\u4eff\u661f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eff\u661f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u4eff\u661f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5728QUASR\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u6027\uff08\u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u65cb\u8f6c\u53d8\u6362\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u5bf9\u79f0\u4eff\u661f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4eff\u661f\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u51c6\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u5c0f\u4e8e5%\uff0c\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fbe\u5230\u4f4e\u4e8e1%\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u4eff\u661f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

However, these systems rely on models whose decisions can be subtly perturbed, raising concerns for security and reliability in ubiquitous sensing. Quantifying and understanding the robustness of such models, defined as their ability to maintain accurate predictions under adversarial perturbations, is therefore critical before wireless sensing can be safely deployed in real-world environments.\n  This work presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of CSI deep learning models under diverse threat models (white-box, black-box/transfer, and universal perturbations) and varying degrees of attack realism. We establish a framework to compare compact temporal autoencoder models with larger deep architectures across three public datasets, quantifying how model scale, training regime, and physical constraints influence robustness. Our experiments show that smaller models, while efficient and equally performant on clean data, are markedly less robust. We further confirm that physically realizable signal-space perturbations, designed to be feasible in real wireless channels, significantly reduce attack success compared to unconstrained feature-space attacks. Adversarial training mitigates these vulnerabilities, improving mean robust accuracy with only moderate degradation in clean performance across both model classes.

An LLM vs. Human Coding Tournament on Market-driven Strategic Planning", "comment": null, "summary": "The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI-assisted code generation. This rapid development of LLMs has outpaced our ability to properly benchmark them. Prevailing benchmarks emphasize unit-test pass rates and syntactic correctness. Such metrics understate the difficulty of many real-world problems that require planning, optimization, and strategic interaction. We introduce a multi-agent reasoning-driven benchmark based on a real-world logistics optimization problem (Auction, Pickup, and Delivery Problem) that couples competitive auctions with capacity-constrained routing. The benchmark requires building agents that can (i) bid strategically under uncertainty and (ii) optimize planners that deliver tasks while maximizing profit. We evaluate 40 LLM-coded agents (by a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs under multiple prompting methodologies, including vibe coding) against 17 human-coded agents developed before the advent of LLMs. Our results over 12 double all-play-all tournaments and $\\sim 40$k matches demonstrate (i) a clear superiority of human(graduate students)-coded agents: the top 5 spots are consistently won by human-coded agents, (ii) the majority of LLM-coded agents (33 out of 40) are beaten by very simple baselines, and (iii) given the best human solution as an input and prompted to improve upon, the best performing LLM makes the solution significantly worse instead of improving it. Our results highlight a gap in LLMs' ability to produce code that works competitively in the real-world, and motivate new evaluations that emphasize reasoning-driven code synthesis in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7269\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u4e2d\u5168\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u663e\u793aLLM\u5728\u9700\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8c03\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6218\u7565\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u62cd\u5356\u3001\u53d6\u8d27\u548c\u914d\u9001\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3040\u4e2aLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e17\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u572812\u573a\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5305\u63fd\u524d5\u540d\uff0c33\u4e2aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u88ab\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\u51fb\u8d25\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f73\u4eba\u7c7b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0cLLM\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u53cd\u800c\u4f7f\u5176\u6076\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ee3\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5f3a\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u5408\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, re-running the same inference process twice often leads to different results due to benign numerical noise, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate variation from actual problems. To address this problem, we introduce Token-DiFR (Token-Divergence-From-Reference), a method for verifying inference outputs by comparing generated tokens against predictions made by a trusted reference implementation conditioned on the same random seed. Sampling seed synchronization tightly constrains valid outputs, leaving providers minimal room to deviate from correct inference, which allows output tokens themselves to serve as auditable evidence of correctness at zero additional cost to the provider. Token-DiFR reliably identifies sampling errors, simulated bugs, and model quantization, detecting 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 within 300 output tokens. For applications requiring sample-efficient forward-pass verification, we additionally introduce Activation-DiFR, a scheme that uses random orthogonal projections to compress activations into compact fingerprints for subsequent verification. Activation-DiFR detects 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 using just 2 output tokens, while reducing communication overhead by 25-75% relative to existing methods.

Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios.

This paper presents a focused investigation into the role of bias-correction, a feature whose contribution remains poorly understood. Through a series of systematic ablations on vision and language modelling tasks, we demonstrate that the conventional wisdom surrounding bias correction is misleading. In particular, we demonstrate that in the optimal hyper-parameter configuration, the inclusion of bias correction leads to no improvement in final test performance. Moreover, unless appropriate learning rate scheduling is implemented, the inclusion of bias correction can sometimes be detrimental to performance. We further reinterpret bias correction as a form of implicit learning rate scheduling whose behaviour is strongly dependent on the choice of smoothing hyper-parameters $\u03b2_1, \u03b2_2 \\in [0,1)$.

While UFNO improves predictive accuracy over FNO, it inefficiently treats scalar inputs (e.g., temperature, injection rate) as spatially distributed fields by duplicating their values across the domain. This forces the model to process redundant constant signals within the frequency domain. Additionally, its standard loss function does not account for spatial variations in error sensitivity, limiting performance in regions of high physical importance. We introduce UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced architecture that incorporates two key innovations. First, we decouple scalar inputs from spatial features using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, allowing the model to modulate spatial feature maps without introducing constant signals into the Fourier transform.

However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faE2E-GRec\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5GNN\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4GNN\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u5b50\u56fe\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eGradnorm\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u635f\u5931\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u4e24\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u505c\u7559\u65f6\u957f\u63d0\u53470.133%\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u8df3\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c110.3171%\u3002", "conclusion": "E2E-GRec\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u8350\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Most existing models rely on fixed-scale structural priors, such as patch-based tokenization, fixed frequency transformations, or frozen backbone architectures. This often leads to over-regularization of temporal dynamics, which limits their ability to adaptively model the full spectrum of temporal variations and impairs their performance on unpredictable, Sudden, high-magnitude events. To address this, we introduce the Multi-scale Temporal Network (MSTN), a novel deep learning architecture founded on a hierarchical multi-scale and sequence modeling principle. The MSTN framework integrates: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that constructs a hierarchical feature pyramid for local patterns (ii) a sequence modeling component for long-range temporal dependencies. We empirically validate this with BiLSTM and Transformer variants, establishing a flexible foundation for future architectural advancements. and (iii) a gated fusion mechanism augmented with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) and multi-head temporal attention (MHTA) for dynamic, context-aware feature integration. This design enables MSTN to adaptively model temporal patterns from milliseconds to long-range dependencies within a unified framework. Extensive evaluations across time-series long-horizon forecasting, imputation, classification and generalizability study demonstrate that MSTN achieves competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, showing improvements over contemporary approaches including EMTSF, LLM4TS, HiMTM, TIME-LLM, MTST, SOFTS, iTransformer, TimesNet, and PatchTST.

A key distinction between their analyses, however, lies in the geometries, e.g., smoothness notions, they rely on. In the convex setting, adaptive optimizers are governed by a stronger adaptive smoothness condition, while NSD relies on the standard notion of smoothness. We extend the theory of adaptive smoothness to the nonconvex setting and show that it precisely characterizes the convergence of adaptive optimizers. Moreover, we establish that adaptive smoothness enables acceleration of adaptive optimizers with Nesterov momentum in the convex setting, a guarantee unattainable under standard smoothness for certain non-Euclidean geometry. We further develop an analogous comparison for stochastic optimization by introducing adaptive gradient variance, which parallels adaptive smoothness and leads to dimension-free convergence guarantees that cannot be achieved under standard gradient variance for certain non-Euclidean geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d(NSD)\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u975e\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0Nesterov\u52a8\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u4ec5\u9002\u5e94\u5f53\u524d\u68af\u5ea6\u65f6\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u6982\u5ff5\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0Nesterov\u52a8\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6807\u51c6\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\uff1b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a0\u901f\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002"}}

We control geometric features such as size, shape, and position through voxel-wise moments, while topological features such as connected components, loops, and voids are enforced through persistent homology. Lastly, we implement Anatomica for latent diffusion models, where neural field decoders partially extract substructures, enabling the efficient control of anatomical properties.

To address this gap, we introduce attention-oriented metrics (ATOMs) to investigate the development of an RL agent's attention during training. In a controlled experiment, we tested ATOMs on three variations of a Pong game, each designed to teach the agent distinct behaviours, complemented by a behavioural assessment. ATOMs successfully delineate the attention patterns of an agent trained on each game variation, and that these differences in attention patterns translate into differences in the agent's behaviour. Through continuous monitoring of ATOMs during training, we observed that the agent's attention developed in phases, and that these phases were consistent across game variations.

The encoder/decoder pair and corresponding latent codes have largely been ignored by inversion techniques applied to latent space generative models, e.g., Latent Diffusion models (LDMs). In this work we describe two key findings: (1) The diffusion model exhibits non-uniform memorization across latent codes, tending to overfit samples located in high-distortion regions of the decoder pullback metric. (2) Even within a single latent code, different dimensions contribute unequally to memorization. We introduce a principled method to rank latent dimensions by their per-dimensional contribution to the decoder pullback metric, identifying those most responsible for memorization.

However, existing models evaluate the quality of retrieval based on proximity, which cannot guarantee that the retrieved pattern has the strongest association with the query, failing correctness. We reframe this problem by proposing that a query is a generative variant of a stored memory pattern, and define a variant distribution to model this subtle context-dependent generative process. Consequently, correct retrieval should return the memory pattern with the maximum a posteriori probability of being the query's origin. This perspective reveals that an ideal similarity measure should approximate the likelihood of each stored pattern generating the query in accordance with variant distribution, which is impossible for fixed and pre-defined similarities used by existing associative memories. To this end, we develop adaptive similarity, a novel mechanism that learns to approximate this insightful but unknown likelihood from samples drawn from context, aiming for correct retrieval. We theoretically prove that our proposed adaptive similarity achieves optimal correct retrieval under three canonical and widely applicable types of variants: noisy, masked, and biased. We integrate this mechanism into a novel adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop), and empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including memory retrieval, tabular classification, image classification, and multiple instance learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u53d8\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u68c0\u7d22\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b58\u50a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Hopfield\u7f51\u7edc\uff08A-Hop\uff09\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u4e09\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6b63\u786e\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact.
