In this\npaper we propose prediction intervals for model averaging based on conformal\ninference. These intervals cover out-of-sample realizations of the outcome\nvariable with a pre-specified probability, providing a way to assess predictive\nuncertainty beyond point prediction. The framework allows general model\nmisspecification and applies to averaging across multiple models that can be\nnested, disjoint, overlapping, or any combination thereof, with weights that\nmay depend on the estimation sample. We establish coverage guarantees under two\nsets of assumptions: exact finite-sample validity under exchangeability,\nrelevant for cross-sectional data, and asymptotic validity under stationarity,\nrelevant for time-series data. We first present a benchmark algorithm and then\nintroduce a locally adaptive refinement and split-sample procedures that\nbroaden applicability. The methods are illustrated with a cross-sectional\napplication to real estate appraisal and a time-series application to equity\npremium forecasting."}

We study a weighting estimator that sets weights by a\nminimax procedure: solving a convex optimization problem that trades off\nworst-case conditional bias against variance. Despite its growing use, general\nroot-$n$ theory for this method has been limited. This paper fills that gap.\nUnder regularity conditions, we show that the minimax linear estimator is\nroot-$n$ consistent and asymptotically normal, and we derive its asymptotic\nvariance. These results justify ignoring worst-case bias when forming\nlarge-sample confidence intervals and make inference less sensitive to the\nscaling of the function class. With a mild variance condition, the estimator\nattains the semiparametric efficiency bound, so an augmentation step commonly\nused in the literature is not needed to achieve first-order optimality.\nEvidence from simulations and three empirical applications, including\njob-training and minimum-wage policies, points to a simple rule: in designs\nsatisfying our regularity conditions, standard-error confidence intervals\nsuffice; otherwise, bias-aware intervals remain important."}

For this\nreason, several methods have been developed for estimating the density ratio\ndirectly based on (a) Bregman divergences or (b) recasting the density ratio as\nthe odds in a probabilistic classification model that predicts whether an\nobservation is sampled from the numerator or denominator distribution.\nAdditionally, the density ratio can be viewed as the Riesz representer of a\ncontinuous linear map, making it amenable to estimation via (c) minimization of\nthe so-called Riesz loss, which was developed to learn the Riesz representer in\nthe Riesz regression procedure in causal inference.

A five-year dataset comprising\napproximately 1,250 trading days of daily stock prices was systematically\ncollected via the Yahoo Finance API. The proposed framework integrates Leaky\nIntegrate-andFire neuron dynamics with adaptive thresholding,\nspike-timingdependent plasticity, and lateral inhibition to enable event-driven\nprocessing of financial time series. Dimensionality reduction is achieved\nthrough hierarchical clustering, while populationbased spike encoding and\nmultiple decoding strategies support robust portfolio construction under\nrealistic trading constraints, including cardinality limits, transaction costs,\nand adaptive risk aversion. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the\nSNN-based framework delivers superior risk-adjusted returns and reduced\nvolatility compared to ANN benchmarks, while substantially improving\ncomputational efficiency. These findings highlight the promise of neuromorphic\ncomputation for scalable, efficient, and robust portfolio optimization across\nglobal financial markets."}

Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not\nrepresentational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic\nstate through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure\nrather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not\nas truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a\nphenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive\nphenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real\nprogress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive\nprinciples structurally."}

Furthermore, we\ntheoretically prove that such adjustments consistently maintain the coverage\nguarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety.\nAdditionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm\nwith theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable\nrisk which closely aligns with Fb-CP. Furthermore, we extend the proposed\nmethod to handle distribution shift. The effectiveness and superiority of the\nproposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments."}

Although various\nself-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these\nmethods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly\ncorrect themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this\nstudy, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the\neffectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and\nfine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical\nreasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction\nmethods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing\ndifferent self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it\nreduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited\noptimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs.\nInterestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline\ndemonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the\npotential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while\nhighlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency.

Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in\ntime offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay\nsettings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC\nnonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to\nrestore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive\nUFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear\nnetwork dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions.\nWe include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed\nmulti-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable\nMINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables\ninto continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs.

This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a\nstatistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of\nsource-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their\ninteraction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by\nmanipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level\nby varying which statistical streams each fact appears in.

In some\ncases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity\nbecomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity\nprohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.\nBeyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical\ngeneralization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.\nThis shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level\nimpacts different generalization aspects.

However, developing an\neffective operational model for battery storage is hindered by inaccurate grid\nmodels, unavailability of load data, nonlinear relationship between power\ninjections and network states, intertemporal constraints, and complex\nelectrochemical and thermal dynamics. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a data-driven operational control scheme for battery storage in\ndistribution systems. Linear and convex quadratic operational constraints are\nconstructed based on real-time distribution system and battery storage\nmeasurements. Lyapunov optimization decouples multi-period battery operation,\nenabling a real-time, forecast-free control strategy with low computational\ncomplexity. Numerical studies using nonlinear distribution system and battery\nstorage simulators validate the effectiveness of the approach in ensuring\nsecure distribution system operation and satisfaction of voltage and thermal\nconstraints of battery storage."}

Accordingly, when generative AI (GenAI) scraping bots\nintentionally circumvent reasonable technological barriers, their conduct could\nbe actionable as trespass to chattels. If the scraping leads to a decrease in\nthe website's value, then trespass to chattels should apply. The prevailing\njudicial focus on website content and the dismissal of trespass claims absent\nproof of server impairment or user disruption misconstrues the nature of the\nwebsite itself as a form of digital property, focusing too narrowly on what\nconstitutes harm under a claim of trespass. By shifting analysis from content\nto the website itself as an integrated digital asset and illustrating the harm\nto the value of the chattel, this paper demonstrates that the right to exclude\napplies online with the same force as it does to tangible property.\n  Courts and litigants have struggled to police large-scale scraping because\ncopyright preemption narrows available claims, leaving copyright and its fair\nuse defense as the primary battleground. In contrast, recognizing websites as\npersonal property revives trespass to chattels as a meaningful cause of action,\nproviding website owners with an enforceable exclusionary right. Such\nprotection would disincentivize exploitative scraping, preserve incentives for\ncontent creation, aid in protecting privacy and personal data, and safeguard\nvalues of autonomy and expression.

Our theory hence\npredicts that, unless the verifier is perfectly reliable, the early gains will\nplateau and may even reverse.

With the rising cost of education and issues in the education\nsector, such as curriculum relevance, student engagement, and rapidly changing\ntechnological advancements, ensuring the relevance of academic programs in a\nfast-evolving job market has created a significant concern for educational\ninstitutions. With the intent to adapt to such challenges, educational\ninstitutions are dealing with alternative solutions for education, in which\nmicro-credentials are at the very center of this, which are short-term academic\nprograms or standalone courses. However, one of the challenges of\nmicro-credentials is a lack of credit transfer among institutions. With the\nlack of standardization of assessments among educational institutions, it is\ndifficult to transfer micro-credentials to larger qualifications. Regarding\nsuch challenges, micro-credentials with blockchain technology can bring\nsignificant benefits. Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and\nimmutable platform for securely storing and verifying credentials. This paper\npresents a prototype model for micro-credential verification. With the policies\ndecided by the educational institution, the learner provides a micro-credential\ncertificate to the system. Upon validation of the certificate by the verifying\nbody, the educational institution will review the assessment criteria and\nprovide exemptions based on the provided criteria. The prototype uses the\nHyper-ledger Fabric platform and utilizes off-chain technology, which acts as a\nmiddle-man storage platform. With the combination of off-chain and on-chain\ntechnologies, congestion on the blockchain is reduced, and transaction speed is\nimproved. In summary, this research proposes a prototype for secure\nmicro-credential verification and a more efficient course exemption process."}

Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing\napproaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework.

In recent\nyears, the stochastic proximal point algorithm (SPPA) emerged, and it was shown\nto be more robust than SGD with respect to stepsize settings. However, SPPA\nstill suffers from a decreased convergence rate due to the need for vanishing\nstepsizes, which is resolved by using variance reduction methods. In the\ndeterministic setting, there are many problems that can be solved more\nefficiently when viewing them in a non-Euclidean geometry using Bregman\ndistances. This paper combines these two worlds and proposes variance reduction\ntechniques for the Bregman stochastic proximal point algorithm (BSPPA). As\nspecial cases, we obtain SAGA- and SVRG-like variance reduction techniques for\nBSPPA. Our theoretical and numerical results demonstrate improved stability and\nconvergence rates compared to the vanilla BSPPA with constant and vanishing\nstepsizes, respectively. Our analysis, also, allow to recover the same variance\nreduction techniques for Bregman SGD in a unified way."}

To address these challenges, we introduce a generic\nneuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The\ncore of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline\nknowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an\nLLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic\nknowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and\nrefined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain\nrequirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is\nencoded into the same formal language.

Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task,\nwe demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with\nstate-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while\nmaintaining trustworthiness.

We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this\nweakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden\nadversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final\noutput. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that\ncombines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on\nsynthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on\nchallenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as\na distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step\ntoward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems."}

Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to\nensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in\nhallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing\nboth truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce\nPrompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework\nthat leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for\nhallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and\nhallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more\neffectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings\nproduced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive\nMahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions\nof truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a\nmatrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying\nstructure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require\nadditional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality\nfor real-world applications.

We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of\nalignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively\nsteer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are\nsufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are\ninstead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be\nlong, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal\n(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework\nexplains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven\nalgorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both\nthe challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment."}

This approach enables solving constrained optimization\nproblems on private data since the operations involved are compatible with the\ncapabilities of homomorphic encryption schemes. To solve the constrained\noptimization problem, a sequence of polynomial penalty functions of increasing\ndegree is introduced, which are sufficiently steep at the boundary of the\nfeasible set.

Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval\napproaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and\ncomposition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete\ncapability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component\nselection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and\nreal-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,\nautomated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the\nknapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically\nidentify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly\nconsidering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility.

While recent works\nhave explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the\nprediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear\nwhat are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever\nmodifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still\ncompetitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In\nthis work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential\nbasis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made\nat irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based\npredictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state\nrepresentation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular\nobservations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)\nobservation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state\nusing learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous\ntime. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on\nnext-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can\nindeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers\ncompelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal\nhyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational\noverhead in the online deployment."}

When this happens, the predictions of an\nML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome\nand undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML\nsystems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be\ncritical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal\nwith this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability\ndistribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this\ndeviation.

While\nsimilar to conventional decoding errors in potentially compromising the\nusability of transcriptions for downstream applications, hallucinations can be\nmore detrimental due to their preservation of syntactically and semantically\nplausible structure. This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing\nstages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as\nhealthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on\nerror-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and\nhallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation\nframeworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened\npropensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce\nSHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and\nquantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes:\nlexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics\nwithin each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior.\nThrough evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have\nfound that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when\nrecognition quality is high (i.e., low WER).

However, their ability to solve more complex\noptimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To\nbridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for\ntraining and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks\nacross five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator,\n(ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides\napproximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This\ngenerator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR\ntraining under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a\nbenchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs'\nability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on\nfeasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present\nQWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and\nachieves SOTA performance with the same model size.

We also observe a\nscaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization.

In this paper, we study the central question of how to design\nexploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in\nLLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that\naugments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on\nthe idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin\nFlipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic\nuncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic\nreward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task\nrewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning\nbenchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of\nthought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps\nthe policy escape local routines to discover better solutions.

However, when using model\nparallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared\nto coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and\nscatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This\nadditional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to\nAdam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic\nOrthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to\nmatrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization\nto maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning\nrate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this\nalgorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for\nthe blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization\nsteps.

The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered\nconsiderable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous\ndetection technologies.

Existing Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited\ncontrol over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the\nheterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the\nfirst adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot\ncontrol attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.\nSpecifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts\nby reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby\nevading detection on social platforms.

A key\nfeature of these estimation laws is that they accelerate the convergence of the\nsystem state, $\\mathit{x(t)}$, to the origin. We quantify this improvement by\nshowing that our estimation laws guarantee finite integrability of the\n$\\mathit{r}$-th root of the squared norm of the system state, i.e., \\(\n\\mathit{\\|x(t)\\|}_2^{2/\\mathit{r}} \\in \\mathcal{L}_1, \\) where $\\mathit{r} \\geq\n1$ is a pre-specified parameter that, for a broad class of systems, can be\nchosen arbitrarily large. In contrast, standard Lyapunov-based estimation laws\nonly guarantee integrability of $\\mathit{\\|x(t)\\|}_2^2$ (i.e., $\\mathit{r} =\n1$). We motivate our method by showing that, for large values of $r$, this\nguarantee serves as a sparsity-promoting mechanism in the time domain, meaning\nthat it penalizes prolonged signal duration and slow decay, thereby promoting\nfaster convergence of $\\mathit{x(t)}$. The proposed estimation laws do not rely\non time-varying or high adaptation gains and do not require persistent\nexcitation. Moreover, they can be applied to systems with matched and unmatched\nuncertainties, regardless of their dynamic structure, as long as a control\nLyapunov function (CLF) exists.

This\nlow-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons\nexchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and\ninter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant\nparameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal\nstability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the\ncontraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence\nprocessing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities\ncorrespond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the\nneural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability.\nEmpirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate\nimproved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate\ncompression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and\ncross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude\nby discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured\nneuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional\nlearning systems."}

We prove that\nunder bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is\nuniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively\nisolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby\nensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees\nestablish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously\nadapting multimodal learning systems."}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the\nfirst adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot\ncontrol attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.\nSpecifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts\nby reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby\nevading detection on social platforms.

Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been\nfound to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as\nhallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to\nensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in\nhallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing\nboth truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce\nPrompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework\nthat leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for\nhallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and\nhallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more\neffectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings\nproduced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive\nMahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions\nof truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a\nmatrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying\nstructure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require\nadditional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality\nfor real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE\nachieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the\ncompetitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%."}

Accordingly, when generative AI (GenAI) scraping bots\nintentionally circumvent reasonable technological barriers, their conduct could\nbe actionable as trespass to chattels. If the scraping leads to a decrease in\nthe website's value, then trespass to chattels should apply. The prevailing\njudicial focus on website content and the dismissal of trespass claims absent\nproof of server impairment or user disruption misconstrues the nature of the\nwebsite itself as a form of digital property, focusing too narrowly on what\nconstitutes harm under a claim of trespass. By shifting analysis from content\nto the website itself as an integrated digital asset and illustrating the harm\nto the value of the chattel, this paper demonstrates that the right to exclude\napplies online with the same force as it does to tangible property.\n  Courts and litigants have struggled to police large-scale scraping because\ncopyright preemption narrows available claims, leaving copyright and its fair\nuse defense as the primary battleground. In contrast, recognizing websites as\npersonal property revives trespass to chattels as a meaningful cause of action,\nproviding website owners with an enforceable exclusionary right. Such\nprotection would disincentivize exploitative scraping, preserve incentives for\ncontent creation, aid in protecting privacy and personal data, and safeguard\nvalues of autonomy and expression.

Although various\nself-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these\nmethods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly\ncorrect themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this\nstudy, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the\neffectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and\nfine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical\nreasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction\nmethods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing\ndifferent self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it\nreduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited\noptimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs.\nInterestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline\ndemonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency.

However, when using model\nparallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared\nto coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and\nscatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This\nadditional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to\nAdam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic\nOrthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to\nmatrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization\nto maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning\nrate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this\nalgorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for\nthe blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization\nsteps. Our method is simple, requires minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and\nachieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon while\nproviding per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such\nas AdamW. When training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO\noptimizer state sharding, MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase compared to\nMuon with no degradation in performance."}

We introduce\nScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through\nthree modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data\nconditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a\ngraph diffusion model.

All tasks share a\ntri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of\nelicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed\nsurface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically\nwith context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number\nof hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework\nfor studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,\nhighlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for\nbuilding truly adaptive AI systems."}

We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model\nDeployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human\nengineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised\nlearning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and\nincrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the\npast data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered\nclasses, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two\nchallenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes\noften appear sporadically in real-life applications.

However, studies\nin the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain\nbetween the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of\nhumans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks\n(GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing\ninput graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a\nreference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's\nrepresentation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node\nfeatures. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer\ndimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the\nmetamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of\nrepresentational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although\ntargeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can\npartially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge\nthe gap to human-like invariance.

We review typical tools comprising VASs and define\nthe associated computational problems they solve. By doing so, VASs can be\ndecomposed into sub-processes and illustrated via data flow diagrams. Moreover,\nwe survey metrics for evaluating VASs throughout the pipeline, thus aiding\nsystem diagnostics.

Ladder-base\nis built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively\non the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data\nfor training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and\ntest sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior\nperformance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both\nstate-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and\nQwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and\nZhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient\nstrategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical\ndomains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM\nartificial intelligence systems."}

To train a robust model for\nmulti-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various\nmedical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing\nacross institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to\naddress this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect\nof data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large\nnumbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these\nchallenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL\nmethod. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating\nclient-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to\ncoordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the\ncontributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,\nwhile the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global\noptimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data\ndistributions.

The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the\nLisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the\nembedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types\nof nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are\ntherefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card,\n1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or\nprogram of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may\ntherefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a\nform of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill\nacquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000),\nexceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020;\nJones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling\nhuman mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and\nthose representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned."}

We design a\ntokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations.\nWe improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with\nadapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to\nfine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is\nallowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments\nwere conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code\nsummarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the\nperformance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results\nvalidate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to\nimproved effectiveness."}

Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires\nmore than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level\nand structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely\ntokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed\nsteps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial\nin solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller\nlanguage models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities\nof a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to\ndeploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and\nproblem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution\npathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem\ndefinitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware\nloss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation\nand to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.\nExperimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap\nand simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model\nin terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across\nthe MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks."}

With\nthe rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale\ndata, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future\nevents, an emerging paradigm we call \"LLM-as-a-Prophet\". This paper\nsystematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end,\nwe build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously\ncollects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline\nstages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our\ncomprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive\nforecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors,\nconsistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also\nuncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via\nLLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of\ndata sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when\nresolution nears."}

On\nthe other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on\nempirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ\nmulti-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the\nabove issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to\nanalyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new\ninteraction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that\nis applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance\ncan be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference\ntechnique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the\ntargeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class\nof causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary\ntask goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the\ncorresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance\ngraph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning\nparadigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In\nexperiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted\nintervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis."}

Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach\nassigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually\ncorrect, and zero otherwise.

For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3%\nreduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised\ntraining and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering,\nthe model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting \"I don't know\"\nwhen faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7%\nfewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively.
