### [1] [Shona spaCy: A Morphological Analyzer for an Under-Resourced Bantu Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16680)
*Happymore Masoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了基于spaCy框架的绍纳语形态分析工具Shona spaCy，包含词典和规则系统，支持词性标注和形态特征分析，准确率达90%和88%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 绍纳语作为班图语系语言，在自然语言处理领域资源匮乏，缺乏形态分析和语言感知工具。

Method: 结合精心策划的JSON词典和基于语言学规则的系统，建模名词类别前缀、动词主语一致、时体标记、拟声词和附着词，集成到词元、词性和形态特征的标记级注释中。

Result: 在正式和非正式绍纳语语料库上的评估显示，词性标注准确率为90%，形态特征准确率为88%。

Conclusion: 通过连接描述性语法和计算实现，Shona spaCy提升了绍纳语使用者的NLP可访问性和数字包容性，并为其他资源匮乏的班图语言提供了形态分析工具的模板。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multilingual natural language processing (NLP), the Bantu language Shona remains under-served in terms of morphological analysis and language-aware tools. This paper presents Shona spaCy, an open-source, rule-based morphological pipeline for Shona built on the spaCy framework. The system combines a curated JSON lexicon with linguistically grounded rules to model noun-class prefixes (Mupanda 1-18), verbal subject concords, tense-aspect markers, ideophones, and clitics, integrating these into token-level annotations for lemma, part-of-speech, and morphological features. The toolkit is available via pip install shona-spacy, with source code at https://github.com/HappymoreMasoka/shona-spacy and a PyPI release at https://pypi.org/project/shona-spacy/0.1.4/. Evaluation on formal and informal Shona corpora yields 90% POS-tagging accuracy and 88% morphological-feature accuracy, while maintaining transparency in its linguistic decisions. By bridging descriptive grammar and computational implementation, Shona spaCy advances NLP accessibility and digital inclusion for Shona speakers and provides a template for morphological analysis tools for other under-resourced Bantu languages.

### [2] [Towards Hyper-Efficient RAG Systems in VecDBs: Distributed Parallel Multi-Resolution Vector Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16681)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPI是一种多分辨率向量索引框架，通过语义金字塔和自适应分辨率控制，在保持语义覆盖的同时显著加速检索，实现5.7倍速度提升和1.8倍内存效率增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量数据库检索管道依赖扁平或单分辨率索引结构，无法适应不同用户查询所需的语义粒度变化，导致检索速度和上下文相关性之间的次优权衡。

Method: 构建文档嵌入的语义金字塔，通过轻量级分类器为每个查询动态选择最优分辨率级别，实现从粗到细的渐进式检索。

Result: 在MS MARCO、Natural Questions等多任务评估中，SPI实现最高5.7倍检索加速、1.8倍内存效率提升，端到端QA F1分数提升达2.5分。

Conclusion: SPI框架与现有向量数据库基础设施兼容，可直接部署到生产RAG系统中，为检索增强生成系统提供了高效的多分辨率索引解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become a dominant approach to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.
  To address this, we propose \textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.
  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \textbf{5.7$\times$} retrieval speedup and \textbf{1.8$\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems. Code is availabe at \href{https://github.com/FastLM/SPI_VecDB}{https://github.com/FastLM/SPI\_VecDB}.

### [3] [Bench360: Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16682)
*Linus Stuhlmann,Mauricio Fadel Argerich,Jonathan Fürst*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bench360是一个全面的本地LLM推理基准测试框架，支持用户自定义任务、数据集和指标，自动测试不同模型、推理引擎和量化级别，揭示任务性能与系统效率之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理基准测试工具设计目标狭窄，无法整合系统指标和任务特定指标，缺乏统一的易用基准测试框架来支持多种推理引擎、使用场景和量化级别。

Method: 开发Bench360框架，允许用户定义自定义任务、数据集和相关指标，自动测试选定LLM、推理引擎和量化级别，涵盖单流、批处理和服务器三种使用场景，跟踪计算性能、资源使用、部署等系统指标以及任务特定指标。

Result: 在四个常见LLM任务、三个硬件平台和四个推理引擎上的测试结果显示，任务性能与系统效率之间存在有趣的权衡，不同推理引擎和模型表现差异显著。

Conclusion: 本地推理没有单一最佳配置，这强烈需要像Bench360这样的框架来帮助用户找到适合自己需求的优化配置。

Abstract: Running large language models (LLMs) locally is becoming increasingly common. While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models. Most importantly, there is no single best setup for local inference, which strongly motivates the need for a framework such as Bench360.

### [4] [How Well Do LLMs Understand Tunisian Arabic?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16683)
*Mohamed Mahdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型对突尼斯阿拉伯语的理解能力，创建了包含突尼斯方言、标准阿拉伯语和英语的平行数据集，并在转写、翻译和情感分析三个任务上测试了多个流行模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业级大语言模型往往忽视低资源语言如突尼斯阿拉伯语的理解能力，这可能导致数百万突尼斯人无法用自己的语言与AI充分交互，威胁方言保护并影响年轻一代的语言偏好。

Method: 创建包含突尼斯方言、标准阿拉伯语和英语的平行数据集，在转写、翻译和情感分析三个任务上对多个流行LLM进行基准测试。

Result: 结果显示不同模型之间存在显著差异，揭示了它们在理解和处理突尼斯方言方面的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在下一代AI系统中包含低资源语言的重要性，以确保技术保持可访问性、包容性和文化根基。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are the engines driving today's AI agents. The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels. We benchmark several popular LLMs on three tasks: transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis. Our results reveal significant differences between models, highlighting both their strengths and limitations in understanding and processing Tunisian dialects. By quantifying these gaps, this work underscores the importance of including low-resource languages in the next generation of AI systems, ensuring technology remains accessible, inclusive, and culturally grounded.

### [5] [Ellipsoid-Based Decision Boundaries for Open Intent Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16685)
*Yuetian Zou,Hanlei Zhang,Hua Xu,Songze Li,Long Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出EliDecide方法，使用椭圆体决策边界来改进文本开放意图分类，通过可学习矩阵参数化椭圆体边界，平衡经验风险和开放空间风险，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自适应决策边界方法假设已知类具有各向同性分布，将边界限制为球形，忽略了不同方向上的分布差异，限制了开放意图检测的能力。

Method: 1) 使用监督对比学习获取判别性特征空间；2) 应用可学习矩阵参数化椭圆体作为已知类边界；3) 通过双损失函数优化边界，平衡经验风险和开放空间风险。

Result: 在多个文本意图基准测试和问题分类数据集上达到最先进性能，椭圆体边界的灵活性展现出优越的开放意图检测能力和泛化潜力。

Conclusion: EliDecide通过椭圆体决策边界有效解决了现有球形边界的局限性，在复杂开放世界场景中具有强大的文本分类任务泛化能力。

Abstract: Textual open intent classification is crucial for real-world dialogue systems, enabling robust detection of unknown user intents without prior knowledge and contributing to the robustness of the system. While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset. The flexibility of the ellipsoids demonstrates superior open intent detection capability and strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.

### [6] [Prompt-Based Value Steering of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16688)
*Giulio Antonio Abbo,Tony Belpaeme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估提示词是否能有效引导生成文本朝向特定人类价值观的实用方法，通过量化目标价值观在生成响应中的存在和增益来评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要与人类价值观对齐的应用中越来越重要，但传统的模型微调方法是静态的，无法适应涉及动态价值观和偏好的日常情境。

Method: 开发了一个实用、可重复且模型无关的评估流程，使用Schwartz基本人类价值观理论和对话数据集进行结构化评估，比较基线提示与明确基于价值观的提示。

Result: 在Wizard-Vicuna语言模型变体上应用该方法，显示即使不改变模型或动态优化提示，价值观引导也是可能的。

Conclusion: 价值观引导可以在不修改模型的情况下实现，为动态价值观对齐提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in applications where alignment with human values is critical. While model fine-tuning is often employed to ensure safe responses, this technique is static and does not lend itself to everyday situations involving dynamic values and preferences. In this paper, we present a practical, reproducible, and model-agnostic procedure to evaluate whether a prompt candidate can effectively steer generated text toward specific human values, formalising a scoring method to quantify the presence and gain of target values in generated responses. We apply our method to a variant of the Wizard-Vicuna language model, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and a structured evaluation through a dialogue dataset. With this setup, we compare a baseline prompt to one explicitly conditioned on values, and show that value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts.

### [7] [Concept-Based Interpretability for Toxicity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16689)
*Samarth Garg,Deeksha Varshney,Divya Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于概念梯度的可解释性方法，通过目标词典集和词-概念对齐分数分析毒性检测中的误分类问题，并引入无词典增强策略来验证模型对毒性语言模式的过度归因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中有害内容传播问题日益严重，现有毒性检测方法缺乏基于概念的解释，且概念对目标类的不均衡归因常导致分类错误。

Method: 利用概念梯度方法提供因果解释，构建目标词典集捕获导致误分类的毒性词汇，计算词-概念对齐分数量化过度归因程度，并通过无词典增强策略生成排除预定义毒性词汇的样本。

Result: 开发了能够识别毒性检测中误分类原因的可解释性框架，揭示了模型对毒性概念的过度归因问题。

Conclusion: 概念梯度方法为毒性检测提供了更因果的解释，目标词典集和词-概念对齐分数有效识别了误分类根源，无词典增强策略证实了模型对毒性语言模式的过度归因问题。

Abstract: The rise of social networks has not only facilitated communication but also allowed the spread of harmful content. Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.

### [8] [Falsely Accused: How AI Detectors Misjudge Slightly Polished Arabic Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16690)
*Saleh Almohaimeed,Saad Almohaimeed,Mousa Jari,Khaled A. Alobaid,Fahad Alotaibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 阿拉伯语AI检测器在检测轻微AI润色的人类文章时表现不佳，误将大量人类文章归类为AI生成，导致准确率显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI检测器对轻微AI润色的人类文章的误判问题，避免错误指控作者使用AI抄袭，并提升AI检测器的可信度。

Method: 生成两个阿拉伯语数据集：第一个包含800篇文章（半AI生成半人类撰写），用于评估14个LLM和商业AI检测器；第二个包含400篇人类文章经10个LLM以4种设置润色后的16400个样本，用于评估8个最佳模型对轻微润色文章的检测能力。

Result: 所有AI检测器均错误地将大量文章归为AI生成。最佳LLM Claude-4 Sonnet准确率从83.51%降至57.63%；最佳商业模型originality.AI准确率从92%骤降至12%。

Conclusion: 当前阿拉伯语AI检测器对轻微AI润色的人类文章存在严重误判问题，需要改进检测算法以提高准确性。

Abstract: Many AI detection models have been developed to counter the presence of articles created by artificial intelligence (AI). However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3. Whereas for the best performing commercial model, originality.AI, that achieves 92% accuracy, dropped to 12% for articles slightly polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.

### [9] [Reproducibility Report: Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16691)
*Boyang Zhou,Johan Lindqvist,Lindsey Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 复现了基于最近邻的测试时训练方法，该方法通过在推理时使用检索到的最近邻序列微调语言模型，显著降低了困惑度和比特率指标，特别是在结构化或专业数据集上效果更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证测试时训练方法的有效性，特别是对于未在类似数据上预训练的模型，以及探索该方法在现代推理优化架构上的适用性。

Method: 使用预训练的RoBERTa嵌入和Faiss索引检索每个测试输入的20个最近邻，对GPT-2、GPT-Neo和R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B模型进行每个邻居一次梯度更新的测试时训练。

Result: 测试时训练显著降低了困惑度和比特率指标，在GitHub和EuroParl等结构化数据集上改进最大。未在The Pile上预训练的模型受益更多，较小模型可以接近较大模型的性能。

Conclusion: 最近邻测试时训练方法具有鲁棒性和通用性，即使对于现代推理优化架构也能带来一致收益，同时提出了内存高效的检索实现方案。

Abstract: We reproduce the central claims of Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models (Hardt and Sun, 2024), which proposes adapting a language model at inference time by fine-tuning on retrieved nearest-neighbor sequences. Using pretrained RoBERTa embeddings indexed with Faiss, we retrieve 20 neighbors per test input and apply one gradient update per neighbor across GPT-2 (117M, 774M), GPT-Neo (1.3B), and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B. Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones. Due to infrastructure limitations, we introduce a memory-efficient retrieval implementation that loads only required line offsets rather than entire files, reducing RAM requirements from over 128 GB per server to 32 GB. We also extend the original study by evaluating R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B, showing that test-time training yields consistent gains even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures. Overall, our results support the robustness and generality of nearest-neighbor test-time training while highlighting practical considerations for reproducing large-scale retrieval-augmented adaptation.

### [10] [How Language Directions Align with Token Geometry in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16693)
*JaeSeong Kim,Suan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了多语言大模型中语言信息的内部表示结构，发现语言信息在第一个transformer块中急剧分离，并始终保持线性可分性，且语言方向与词汇嵌入的对齐与训练数据的语言组成密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多语言LLM在多种语言上表现强劲，但对其内部表示空间中语言信息的结构方式及跨层涌现机制缺乏系统性分析。

Method: 使用线性和非线性探针结合新的Token-Language Alignment分析，对6个多语言LLM的268个transformer层进行全面探测研究。

Result: 语言信息在第一个transformer块中急剧分离（从第0层到第1层提升76.4±8.2个百分点），中文包含模型的中文匹配峰值达到16.43%，而英语中心模型仅为3.90%，显示出4.21倍的结构印记效应。

Conclusion: 多语言LLM不是通过表面脚本特征来区分语言，而是通过训练语料塑造的潜在表示结构，这为多语言表示学习的数据组成策略和公平性提供了实践启示。

Abstract: Multilingual LLMs demonstrate strong performance across diverse languages, yet there has been limited systematic analysis of how language information is structured within their internal representation space and how it emerges across layers. We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\%, revealing a 4.21$\times$ structural imprinting effect. These findings indicate that multilingual LLMs distinguish languages not by surface script features but by latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus. Our analysis provides practical insights for data composition strategies and fairness in multilingual representation learning. All code and analysis scripts are publicly available at: https://github.com/thisiskorea/How-Language-Directions-Align-with-Token-Geometry-in-Multilingual-LLMs.

*Jonathon Dilworth,Hui Yang,Jiaoyan Chen,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了基于语言模型的嵌入方法，用于在SNOMED CT中检索OOV查询的层次概念，效果优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNOMED CT中的知识检索面临语言歧义、同义词、多义词等挑战，特别是当查询是词汇表外(OOV)时，问题更加严重。

Method: 使用基于语言模型的ontology嵌入方法，构建OOV查询标注数据集，测试最直接子类和较少相关祖先的检索。

Result: 该方法在SNOMED CT上的表现优于SBERT和两种词汇匹配基线方法。

Conclusion: 虽然针对SNOMED CT评估，但该方法具有通用性，可扩展到其他本体。已发布代码、工具和评估数据集。

Abstract: SNOMED CT is a biomedical ontology with a hierarchical representation of large-scale concepts. Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods. While evaluated against SNOMED CT, the approach is generalisable and can be extended to other ontologies. We release code, tools, and evaluation datasets at https://github.com/jonathondilworth/HR-OOV.

### [12] [Detecting and Steering LLMs' Empathy in Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16699)
*Juan P. Cadile*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现共情行为（牺牲任务效率来满足人类需求）在LLM激活空间中表现为线性方向，通过对比提示在三个不同模型中进行检测和操控测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型中是否编码了共情行为，以及这种编码是否能被检测和操控，特别是比较安全训练模型和未审查模型的差异。

Method: 使用基于EIA基准的对比提示，在Phi-3-mini-4k、Qwen2.5-7B和Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B三个模型上进行检测和操控实验。检测使用AUROC指标，操控测试双向控制能力。

Result: 所有模型在最佳层都表现出高检测精度（AUROC 0.996-1.00），但跨模型探针一致性有限。操控成功率：Qwen 65.3%，Phi-3 61.7%，Dolphin在亲共情方向94.4%但反共情方向崩溃。

Conclusion: 检测-操控差距因模型而异，安全训练可能影响操控鲁棒性而非阻止操控，Dolphin仅在增强共情时保持鲁棒性，需要更多模型验证。

Abstract: We investigate empathy-in-action -- the willingness to sacrifice task efficiency to address human needs -- as a linear direction in LLM activation space. Using contrastive prompts grounded in the Empathy-in-Action (EIA) benchmark, we test detection and steering across Phi-3-mini-4k (3.8B), Qwen2.5-7B (safety-trained), and Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B (uncensored).
  Detection: All models show AUROC 0.996-1.00 at optimal layers. Uncensored Dolphin matches safety-trained models, demonstrating empathy encoding emerges independent of safety training. Phi-3 probes correlate strongly with EIA behavioral scores (r=0.71, p<0.01). Cross-model probe agreement is limited (Qwen: r=-0.06, Dolphin: r=0.18), revealing architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection.
  Steering: Qwen achieves 65.3% success with bidirectional control and coherence at extreme interventions. Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts).
  Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model. Qwen and Phi-3 maintain bidirectional coherence; Dolphin shows robustness only for empathy enhancement. Safety training may affect steering robustness rather than preventing manipulation, though validation across more models is needed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从孟加拉语指令生成代码的挑战，通过多智能体协作提高代码生成的质量和准确性。

Method: 提出基于多智能体的流水线方法：首先由代码生成智能体根据输入指令生成初始解决方案，然后执行单元测试，仅将失败的测试用例转发给调试智能体，该智能体基于错误信息、当前程序和相关测试用例生成修订后的解决方案。

Result: 在BLP-2025共享任务中获得第一名，Pass@1分数达到95.4%。

Conclusion: 多智能体流水线方法在代码生成任务中表现优异，通过迭代调试机制显著提高了代码质量，系统代码已公开。

Abstract: This paper presents JGU Mainz's winning system for the BLP-2025 Shared Task on Code Generation from Bangla Instructions. We propose a multi-agent-based pipeline. First, a code-generation agent produces an initial solution from the input instruction. The candidate program is then executed against the provided unit tests (pytest-style, assert-based). Only the failing cases are forwarded to a debugger agent, which reruns the tests, extracts error traces, and, conditioning on the error messages, the current program, and the relevant test cases, generates a revised solution. Using this approach, our submission achieved first place in the shared task with a $Pass@1$ score of 95.4. We also make our code public.

*Michael Carl,Takanori Mizowaki,Aishvarya Raj,Masaru Yamada,Devi Sri Bandaru,Yuxiang Wei,Xinyue Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于扩展心智理论和激进具身认知的翻译心智ABC框架，将翻译视为整合情感、行为和认知过程的具身活动，而非基于表征的心理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战基于表征的心智模型，为翻译研究提供非表征主义的替代方案，强调翻译是动态的具身参与过程。

Method: 结合扩展心智理论、激进具身认知、预测处理和主动推理理论，构建翻译心智的ABC框架（情感-行为-认知）。

Result: 提出了翻译心智作为脑-体-环境互动循环中涌现的现象，而非仅仅扩展的心智，将翻译重新定义为技能性参与社会文化实践。

Conclusion: 翻译是意义在具身互动中实时共同创造的过程，而非静态的语际对应关系操作，这为非表征主义的翻译理论提供了新视角。

Abstract: Building on the Extended Mind (EM) theory and radical enactivism, this article suggests an alternative to representation-based models of the mind. We lay out a novel ABC framework of the translating mind, in which translation is not the manipulation of static interlingual correspondences but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes. Drawing on Predictive Processing and (En)Active Inference, we argue that the translator's mind emerges, rather than being merely extended, through loops of brain-body-environment interactions. This non-representational account reframes translation as skillful participation in sociocultural practice, where meaning is co-created in real time through embodied interaction with texts, tools, and contexts.

*Eva Neu,Brian Dillon,Katrin Erk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新探讨了非宾格动词和作格动词与施事性和终结性之间的关系，使用基于种子词的可解释维度分析，发现两者确实存在关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kim等人(2024)发现人类对施事性和终结性的评分不能很好地预测不及物动词的句法行为，本文旨在重新检验这一关系。

Method: 使用基于施事性和终结性两极种子词计算的可解释维度进行分析。

Result: 研究结果支持了非宾格/作格性与施事性/终结性之间的联系，表明可解释维度与人类判断结合使用能为语义属性提供有价值的证据。

Conclusion: 使用可解释维度结合人类判断可以更好地理解不易在评分任务中评估的语义属性，证实了传统语言学假设的正确性。

Abstract: Intransitive verbs fall into two different syntactic classes, unergatives and unaccusatives. It has long been argued that verbs describing an agentive action are more likely to appear in an unergative syntax, and those describing a telic event to appear in an unaccusative syntax. However, recent work by Kim et al. (2024) found that human ratings for agentivity and telicity were a poor predictor of the syntactic behavior of intransitives. Here we revisit this question using interpretable dimensions, computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales. Our findings support the link between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity, and demonstrate that using interpretable dimensions in conjunction with human judgments can offer valuable evidence for semantic properties that are not easily evaluated in rating tasks.

*Oscar Chew,Po-Yi Lu,Jayden Lin,Kuan-Hao Huang,Hsuan-Tien Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEPPER是一种针对文本到图像扩散模型后门攻击的防御方法，通过重写输入提示来破坏嵌入的触发器，同时保持视觉相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型容易受到后门攻击，攻击者可以通过在输入提示中插入触发器来引导生成有害内容。

Method: PEPPER通过将输入提示重写为语义上不同但视觉上相似的描述，并添加不显眼的元素来破坏触发器。

Result: 实验表明PEPPER对基于文本编码器的攻击特别有效，显著降低攻击成功率同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: PEPPER可与现有防御方法结合使用，提供比任何单独方法更强和更通用的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent studies show that text to image (T2I) diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a trigger in the input prompt can steer generation toward harmful or unintended content. To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality. Beyond this, PEPPER can be paired with any existing defenses yielding consistently stronger and generalizable robustness than any standalone method. Our code will be released on Github.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参考标准的LLM响应简洁性评估指标，通过三种压缩比计算来量化非必要内容


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常生成冗长啰嗦的响应，包含冗余或不必要的细节，这会降低清晰度和用户满意度，并增加模型开发者的成本

Method: 计算三个压缩比的平均值：1）原始响应与LLM抽象摘要的压缩比；2）原始响应与LLM提取摘要的压缩比；3）LLM在保持意义的前提下移除尽可能多非必要词语的压缩比

Result: 实验结果表明，该指标能够识别LLM输出中的冗余，为对话AI系统提供无需人工标注的自动响应简洁性评估工具

Conclusion: 提出的无参考指标为评估LLM响应简洁性提供了实用工具，无需依赖黄金标准参考或人工标注

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate responses that are lengthy and verbose, filled with redundant or unnecessary details. This diminishes clarity and user satisfaction, and it increases costs for model developers, especially with well-known proprietary models that charge based on the number of output tokens. In this paper, we introduce a novel reference-free metric for evaluating the conciseness of responses generated by LLMs. Our method quantifies non-essential content without relying on gold standard references and calculates the average of three calculations: i) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM abstractive summary; ii) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM extractive summary; and iii) wordremoval compression, where an LLM removes as many non-essential words as possible from the response while preserving its meaning, with the number of tokens removed indicating the conciseness score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems without the need for ground truth human annotations.

### [18] [Improving Latent Reasoning in LLMs via Soft Concept Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16885)
*Kang Wang,Xiangyu Duan,Tianyi Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Soft Concept Mixing (SCM)训练方案，通过在训练中引入软概念表示来弥合LLM推理中的软概念与离散token训练之间的差距，提升了推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM通过离散token进行推理限制了其表达能力，而软概念推理是一个有前景的方向。为了减少推理中的软概念与离散token训练之间的差距，需要开发软概念感知的训练方案。

Method: SCM通过构建软概念向量（嵌入的加权平均），将其混合到模型的隐藏状态中，并使用强化学习优化整个潜在推理过程。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试上的实验表明，SCM提高了LLM的推理性能，同时保持了稳定的训练动态。

Conclusion: SCM通过直接暴露模型于软表示的训练方案，有效提升了LLM的推理能力，证明了软概念感知训练的价值。

Abstract: Unlike human reasoning in abstract conceptual spaces, large language models (LLMs) typically reason by generating discrete tokens, which potentially limit their expressive power. The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SCM improves the reasoning performance of LLMs, and simultaneously maintains a stable training dynamic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练方案，通过将TRM的潜在推理视为分类器自由引导和隐式策略改进算法，显著提升了训练效率，在保持质量的同时减少了18倍前向传播次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何以最小改动进一步提高Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs) 在复杂推理任务上的效率，特别是针对Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) 任务。

Method: 将TRM的潜在推理框架化为分类器自由引导和隐式策略改进算法，提出为每个训练循环提供目标的新训练方案。

Result: 方法显著提升训练效率：总前向传播次数减少18倍，无需停止机制，在ARC-1上达到24%准确率（仅0.8M参数），优于大多数LLM。

Conclusion: 提出的训练方案能显著提高TRM的训练效率，在保持性能的同时大幅减少计算成本，证明了小规模模型在复杂推理任务上的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, it was shown that small, looped architectures, such as Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs), can outperform Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, including the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we investigate a core question: how can we further improve the efficiency of these methods with minimal changes? To address this, we frame the latent reasoning of TRMs as a form of classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose a novel training scheme that provides a target for each loop during training. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances training efficiency. Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18x and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了训练数据的统计特性与诱导头形成的关系，发现批量大小和上下文长度的组合能预测诱导头形成点，表面二元组重复频率和可靠性强烈影响诱导头形成，并确定了精确的帕累托边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 诱导头被认为是现代语言模型具有出色上下文学习能力的关键，但其形成的精确机制尚不清楚。本研究旨在揭示训练数据统计特性与诱导头形成之间的关系。

Method: 通过分析自然和合成数据的统计特性，研究批量大小、上下文长度、表面二元组重复频率和可靠性对诱导头形成的影响，并确定帕累托边界。

Result: 发现批量大小和上下文长度的简单组合能预测诱导头形成点；表面二元组重复频率和可靠性强烈影响诱导头形成，存在精确的帕累托边界；当频率和可靠性低时，类别性和边际分布形状变得重要。

Conclusion: 局部依赖性与高二元组重复频率和可靠性足以形成诱导头，但当这些值较低时，需要类别性和边际分布形状的参与。这为理解诱导头形成机制提供了精确的量化框架。

Abstract: Arguably, specialized attention heads dubbed induction heads (IHs) underlie the remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of modern language models (LMs); yet, a precise characterization of their formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the relationship between statistical properties of training data (for both natural and synthetic data) and IH formation. We show that (1) a simple equation combining batch size and context size predicts the point at which IHs form; (2) surface bigram repetition frequency and reliability strongly affect the formation of IHs, and we find a precise Pareto frontier in terms of these two values; and (3) local dependency with high bigram repetition frequency and reliability is sufficient for IH formation, but when the frequency and reliability are low, categoriality and the shape of the marginal distribution matter.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的论点感知定量摘要任务，通过ARQUSUMM框架揭示对话中的论点结构并量化论点强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话摘要研究未能深入揭示句子内部的论点结构，无法明确论点的理由-主张关系及其量化支持度。

Method: ARQUSUMM框架：1）利用LLM少样本学习识别句子中的命题及其主张-理由关系；2）采用论点结构感知聚类算法聚合论点并量化支持度。

Result: 实验表明ARQUSUMM优于现有对话和定量摘要模型，生成的摘要能更好地表示论点结构，具有更高的文本质量和量化准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功实现了对话中论点结构的深度揭示和量化，为理解在线讨论的论证过程提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Online conversations have become more prevalent on public discussion platforms (e.g. Reddit). With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments show that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models and generate summaries representing argument structures that are more helpful to users, of high textual quality and quantification accuracy.

TL;DR: 本研究提出监督微调方法增强大语言模型在湖南历史名人领域的知识提取能力，通过构建领域特定的指令模板和数据集，在低资源环境下显著提升信息提取性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湖南历史名人系统数据资源有限，通用大模型在领域知识提取和结构化输出生成方面表现不佳，需要针对性的解决方案。

Method: 设计细粒度模式引导的指令模板，构建指令调优数据集，对Qwen2.5-7B、Qwen3-8B等四个大模型进行参数高效指令微调，并开发评估标准。

Result: 所有模型微调后性能显著提升，其中Qwen3-8B表现最佳，在100样本和50次训练迭代下达到89.3866分。

Conclusion: 研究为垂直领域大语言模型微调提供了新思路，展示了在文化遗产知识提取和知识图谱构建中的成本效益应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models and knowledge graphs offer strong potential for advancing research on historical culture by supporting the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of cultural heritage. Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations. This study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.

*Gyuwon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究构建了视觉说服力判断数据集，分析了视觉语言模型在理解视觉说服因素方面的能力，发现模型存在回忆偏向，且主要通过高层语义对齐来判断说服力，而非低中层视觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉语言模型是否真正理解视觉说服——即视觉线索如何影响人类态度和决策，目前尚不清楚。

Method: 构建二元说服力判断数据集，引入视觉说服因素分类法（包括低层感知、中层构图和高层语义线索），探索认知引导和知识注入策略。

Result: VLMs存在回忆偏向（过度预测高说服力），对低中层特征的判别能力弱；高层语义对齐是最强预测因子；简洁、基于对象的理由能显著提升精度和F1分数。

Conclusion: VLMs的核心局限不在于识别说服性对象，而在于将其与沟通意图联系起来。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multi-modal reasoning and understanding. Yet, whether these models truly grasp visual persuasion-how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions-remains unclear. To probe this question, we construct a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment and introduce the taxonomy of Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs), encompassing low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, and high-level semantic cues. We also explore cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning. Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. In contrast, high-level semantic alignment between message and object presence emerges as the strongest predictor of human judgment. Among intervention strategies, simple instruction or unguided reasoning scaffolds yield marginal or negative effects, whereas concise, object-grounded rationales significantly improve precision and F1 scores. These results indicate that VLMs core limitation lies not in recognizing persuasive objects but in linking them to communicative intent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的自动评分框架AnalyticScore，通过四个可解释性原则(FGTI)和基于LLM的特征提取方法，在保持高准确性的同时提供透明评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI自动评分系统缺乏透明度和可解释性，无法满足大规模真实评估的需求，需要开发可解释的自动评分解决方案。

Method: 开发AnalyticScore框架：1)提取可识别响应元素，2)使用LLM将响应转化为人类可解释的特征值，3)应用直观的有序逻辑回归模型进行评分。

Result: 在ASAP-SAS数据集的10个项目上，AnalyticScore的评分准确性超过许多不可解释方法，仅比不可解释SOTA方法平均低0.06 QWK。特征化行为与人类标注者高度一致。

Conclusion: AnalyticScore框架证明可解释自动评分在保持高准确性的同时是可行的，为未来研究提供了基准参考框架。

Abstract: AI-driven automated scoring systems offer scalable and efficient means of evaluating complex student-generated responses. Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型缺乏可靠性的问题，为声明级不确定性量化方法提供公平、可复现的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含多语言样本的基准数据集，提供token级生成logits，开发确定性声明分割算法（仅需0.2%的LLM生成时间）。

Result: 当前方法在性能和效率方面仍有很大改进空间，MUCH基准能够有效评估UQ方法在实际部署条件下的表现。

Conclusion: MUCH基准为声明级不确定性量化研究提供了重要工具，支持未来白盒方法的发展，并适用于实时监控LLM输出。

Abstract: Claim-level Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to mitigate the lack of reliability in Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce MUCH, the first claim-level UQ benchmark designed for fair and reproducible evaluation of future methods under realistic conditions. It includes 4,873 samples across four European languages (English, French, Spanish, and German) and four instruction-tuned open-weight LLMs. Unlike prior claim-level benchmarks, we release 24 generation logits per token, facilitating the development of future white-box methods without re-generating data. Moreover, in contrast to previous benchmarks that rely on manual or LLM-based segmentation, we propose a new deterministic algorithm capable of segmenting claims using as little as 0.2% of the LLM generation time. This makes our segmentation approach suitable for real-time monitoring of LLM outputs, ensuring that MUCH evaluates UQ methods under realistic deployment constraints. Finally, our evaluations show that current methods still have substantial room for improvement in both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: We report on the first large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) pretraining study on pure AMD hardware, utilizing both MI300X GPUs with Pollara interconnect. We distill practical guidance for both systems and model design. On the systems side, we deliver a comprehensive cluster and networking characterization: microbenchmarks for all core collectives (all-reduce, reduce-scatter, all-gather, broadcast) across message sizes and GPU counts on Pollara. To our knowledge, this is the first at this scale. We further provide MI300X microbenchmarks on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform model design. On the modeling side, we introduce and apply MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules for attention and MLP blocks and justify MoE widths that jointly optimize training throughput and inference latency. We describe our training stack in depth, including often-ignored utilities such as fault-tolerance and checkpoint-reshaping, as well as detailed information on our training recipe. We also provide a preview of our model architecture and base model - ZAYA1 (760M active, 8.3B total parameters MoE) - which will be further improved upon in forthcoming papers. ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to leading base models such as Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B at its scale and larger, and outperforms models including Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that the AMD hardware, network, and software stack are mature and optimized enough for competitive large-scale pretraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用上下文压缩作为预训练任务来改进LLM的文本表示能力，相比基于token级预测的方法表现更好且更样本高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM主要针对因果预测任务优化，不适合生成整体文本表示。虽然已有研究引入预训练任务来适配LLM，但大多依赖token级预测目标，存在局限性。

Method: 提出上下文压缩预训练任务，让模型学习生成紧凑的记忆token来替代整个上下文进行序列预测，并结合对比学习进一步优化。

Conclusion: 上下文压缩是一种有效的预训练任务，能够显著提升LLM的文本表示能力，在性能和样本效率方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.

Result: 大语言模型通过少量样本提示能够有效执行自动后编辑，改进领先的商业和专有机器翻译系统。

Conclusion: LangMark数据集将促进自动后编辑系统的未来发展和评估，大语言模型在自动后编辑任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to correct errors in machine-translated text, enhancing translation quality, while reducing the need for human intervention. Despite advances in neural machine translation (NMT), the development of effective APE systems has been hindered by the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets specifically tailored to NMT outputs. To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation. Annotated by expert human linguists, our dataset offers both linguistic diversity and scale. Leveraging this dataset, we empirically show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting can effectively perform APE, improving upon leading commercial and even proprietary machine translation systems.

Motivation: 为PLLuM项目的波兰大型语言模型开发提供高质量的指令数据集，并探索不同类型指令在语言模型适应中的效果差异。

Method: 构建了包含有机、转换和合成指令的功能分类数据集，并分析了人工编写与合成指令在语言适应过程中的表现。

TL;DR: 提出ABCA框架，通过因果推理分析LLM内部知识多样性，实现早期弃权决策，防止幻觉回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弃权方法依赖生成后信号，无法提前防止不可靠回答。LLM从不同来源获取的知识具有多面性，需要评估知识可靠性。

Method: 基于方面的因果弃权(ABCA)框架，通过条件因果效应分析知识多样性，检测知识冲突(类型1)和知识不足(类型2)。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ABCA提高了弃权可靠性，达到最先进性能，并增强了弃权决策的可解释性。

Conclusion: ABCA通过分析内部知识多样性实现早期弃权，有效防止LLM幻觉，为可靠AI系统提供新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent but factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as "I don't know", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.

### [31] [Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) Model for Integrating Statistical and Semantic Features in News Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17184)
*Mohammad Zare*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种注意力引导特征融合(AGFF)模型，将统计特征和语义特征结合，通过注意力机制动态确定各特征类型的重要性，在新闻文本分类任务中表现优于传统统计模型和纯语义深度学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法(如TF-IDF)能捕捉词汇重要性但缺乏上下文语义，而现代深度学习方法能理解语义但可能忽略高影响力的统计指标，需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用注意力引导特征融合(AGFF)框架，通过注意力机制动态融合统计特征和语义特征，让模型自主决定各特征类型在分类中的相对重要性。

Result: 在基准新闻数据集上的评估显示，AGFF模型性能优于传统统计模型和纯语义深度学习模型，消融研究验证了融合过程中各组成部分的贡献。

Conclusion: 策略性地整合多样化特征类型能显著提升分类准确率，该模型能平衡并利用统计和语义表示的互补优势，是实际新闻分类任务的有效解决方案。

Abstract: News text classification is a crucial task in natural language processing, essential for organizing and filtering the massive volume of digital content. Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.

TL;DR: AutoLink是一个自主代理框架，将模式链接重新定义为迭代的、代理驱动的过程，通过动态探索和扩展链接模式子集，在工业级文本到SQL中实现高召回率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业级文本到SQL中，将整个数据库模式提供给大型语言模型不切实际，因为存在上下文窗口限制和无关噪声。现有方法成本高、难以平衡召回率和噪声，且在大数据库中扩展性差。

Method: AutoLink是一个自主代理框架，由LLM引导，动态探索和扩展链接模式子集，逐步识别必要的模式组件，无需输入完整数据库模式。

Result: 在Bird-Dev上达到97.4%的严格模式链接召回率，在Spider-2.0-Lite上达到91.2%，执行准确率分别为68.7%和34.9%，在大规模模式（如超过3000列）上保持高召回率和高效令牌消耗。

Conclusion: AutoLink是一个高度可扩展、高召回率的模式链接解决方案，适用于工业文本到SQL系统，在大规模模式上表现优异。

Abstract: For industrial-scale text-to-SQL, supplying the entire database schema to Large Language Models (LLMs) is impractical due to context window limits and irrelevant noise. Schema linking, which filters the schema to a relevant subset, is therefore critical. However, existing methods incur prohibitive costs, struggle to trade off recall and noise, and scale poorly to large databases. We present \textbf{AutoLink}, an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative, agent-driven process. Guided by an LLM, AutoLink dynamically explores and expands the linked schema subset, progressively identifying necessary schema components without inputting the full database schema. Our experiments demonstrate AutoLink's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of \textbf{97.4\%} on Bird-Dev and \textbf{91.2\%} on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy, i.e., \textbf{68.7\%} EX on Bird-Dev (better than CHESS) and \textbf{34.9\%} EX on Spider-2.0-Lite (ranking 2nd on the official leaderboard). Crucially, AutoLink exhibits \textbf{exceptional scalability}, \textbf{maintaining high recall}, \textbf{efficient token consumption}, and \textbf{robust execution accuracy} on large schemas (e.g., over 3,000 columns) where existing methods severely degrade-making it a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution for industrial text-to-SQL systems.

TL;DR: E3Layer是一个层剪枝框架，通过可微分掩码优化和熵感知知识蒸馏，在保持性能的同时实现高效剪枝和推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层剪枝方法难以同时解决性能下降、训练成本高和加速有限等实际部署挑战。

Method: 提出可微分掩码优化方法（使用Gumbel-TopK采样器）和熵感知自适应知识蒸馏策略。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B上剪枝25%层时，MATH-500准确率达96%（仅比原模型下降0.8%），优于现有SOTA（95%），推理速度提升1.33倍，仅消耗0.5B tokens。

Conclusion: E3Layer框架能有效平衡剪枝效率、训练成本和模型性能，为大规模语言模型部署提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing size of large language models, layer pruning has gained increased attention as a hardware-friendly approach for model compression. However, existing layer pruning methods struggle to simultaneously address key practical deployment challenges, including performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose \name, a task-\underline{E}ffective, training-\underline{E}conomical and inference-\underline{E}fficient layer pruning framework. \namespace introduces two key innovations: (1) a differentiable mask optimization method using a Gumbel-TopK sampler, enabling efficient and precise pruning mask search; and (2) an entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation strategy that enhances task performance. Extensive experiments over diverse model architectures and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, \namespace achieves 96\% accuracy, a mere 0.8\% drop from the original model (96.8\%) on MATH-500 when pruning 25\% layers of Qwen3-32B, outperforming existing SOTA (95\%), with a 1.33$\times$ inference speedup by consuming merely 0.5B tokens (0.5\% of the post-training data volume).

*Sizhe Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件语义的对话记忆方法，将对话历史表示为短小的事件命题，通过异质图组织会话和基本话语单元，在保持信息非压缩形式的同时提高可访问性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对话代理在多轮对话中难以保持连贯性和个性化，固定上下文窗口限制了历史信息的保留，外部记忆方法在粗粒度检索和细粒度碎片化视图之间存在权衡。

Method: 指导LLM将每个会话分解为丰富的基本话语单元（EDUs）——包含标准化实体和来源轮次属性的自包含语句，在异质图中组织会话、EDUs及其参数，支持关联检索。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval$_S$基准测试中，这种事件中心记忆方法匹配或超越了强基线，同时在更短的QA上下文中运行。

Conclusion: 结构简单的事件级记忆为长视野对话代理提供了原则性和实用的基础。

Abstract: LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在权威压力下过度顺从（sycophancy）的现象，评估模型在真实世界部署中抵抗社会压力的能力。

Method: 使用1,302个MMLU式选择题，比较中性问题和权威性错误版本，通过双盲评估、log-likelihood校准追踪和八状态行为分类法分析模型行为。

Result: 先进模型（GPT-5、GPT-4.1等）跟随率低（≤11%），准确性损失小；老旧/小型模型出现严重认知崩溃（GPT-4:80%，Qwen 2.5-1.5B:94%）。国际法和全球知识领域脆弱，初等数学相对稳健。

Conclusion: 抵抗过度压力应作为模型安全部署的主要目标之一，与准确性、伤害避免和隐私同等重要。

Abstract: This study presents PARROT (Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth), a robustness focused framework designed to measure the degradation in accuracy that occurs under social pressure exerted on users through authority and persuasion in large language models (LLMs) the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity). PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格问答数据集主要是英语且表格格式完美，与现实场景存在显著差距，需要评估模型在多语言和视觉噪声环境下的表现。

Method: 创建包含近6万QA对、覆盖24种语言的MirageTVQA基准测试，引入视觉噪声模拟扫描文档，评估领先视觉语言模型的性能。

Result: 评估发现两个主要失败点：面对视觉噪声时性能严重下降（最佳模型下降超过35%），以及存在英语优先偏见，推理能力无法有效迁移到其他语言。

Conclusion: MirageTVQA为衡量和推动更鲁棒的表格推理视觉语言模型提供了基准，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The impressive performance of VLMs is largely measured on benchmarks that fail to capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format. This creates a significant gap between research and practice. To address this, we present \textbf{MirageTVQA}, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on these exact dimensions. Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages. MirageTVQA provides a benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models for table reasoning. The dataset and the code are available at: https://github.com/anshulsc/MirageTVQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注常见行为如转发和点赞，而对罕见但重要行为的预测研究较少

Method: 结合四种互补方法：基于历史响应模式的查找数据库、针对常见行为的persona特定LightGBM模型、融合文本和时间表示的混合神经网络架构用于罕见行为分类、文本回复生成

Result: 常见行为预测平均macro F1-score为0.64，罕见行为分类在10种罕见行为上达到0.56 macro F1-score

Conclusion: 有效的社交媒体行为预测需要针对不同类型行为采用定制化建模策略

Abstract: Understanding and predicting user behavior on social media platforms is crucial for content recommendation and platform design. While existing approaches focus primarily on common actions like retweeting and liking, the prediction of rare but significant behaviors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for social media user behavior prediction that addresses both frequent and infrequent actions across a diverse action vocabulary. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale Bluesky dataset containing 6.4 million conversation threads spanning 12 distinct user actions across 25 persona clusters. Our methodology combines four complementary approaches: (i) a lookup database system based on historical response patterns; (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered temporal and semantic features for common actions; (iii) a specialized hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare action classification; and (iv) generation of text replies. Our persona-specific models achieve an average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common action prediction, while our rare action classifier achieves 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions. These results demonstrate that effective social media behavior prediction requires tailored modeling strategies recognizing fundamental differences between action types. Our approach achieved first place in the SocialSim: Social-Media Based Personas challenge organized at the Social Simulation with LLMs workshop at COLM 2025.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a localized and culturally adapted Estonian translation of the test set from the widely used commonsense reasoning benchmark, WinoGrande. We detail the translation and adaptation process carried out by translation specialists and evaluate the performance of both proprietary and open source models on the human translated benchmark. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of achieving high-quality machine translation by incorporating insights from the manual translation process into the design of a detailed prompt. This prompt is specifically tailored to address both the linguistic characteristics of Estonian and the unique translation challenges posed by the WinoGrande dataset. Our findings show that model performance on the human translated Estonian dataset is slightly lower than on the original English test set, while performance on machine-translated data is notably worse. Additionally, our experiments indicate that prompt engineering offers limited improvement in translation quality or model accuracy, and highlight the importance of involving language specialists in dataset translation and adaptation to ensure reliable and interpretable evaluations of language competency and reasoning in large language models.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了GPT-3.5、GPT-4、LlaMa 2、PaLM 2和Dolly 2等大型语言模型在南非英语、Sepedi语和Setswana语社交媒体帖子中的零样本情感分析性能，发现通过融合不同LLM的结果可以将情感分类错误率降至1%以下。

Motivation: 在多元语言社区中，利用情感分析系统快速识别社交媒体中的社会挑战，帮助政府部门更精确有效地检测和解决问题。虽然LLM在英语情感分析中表现出色，但在南非语言中的应用尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 分析五种最先进的LLM（GPT-3.5、GPT-4、LlaMa 2、PaLM 2和Dolly 2）在南非10个政府部门管辖范围内的10个新兴话题的英语、Sepedi语和Setswana语社交媒体帖子中的零样本情感极性分析性能。

Conclusion: 现在可以构建可靠的情感分析系统来检测社会挑战，并为特定话题和不同语言群体提供行动需求结论。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis can aid in understanding people's opinions and emotions on social issues. In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数对话系统设计为一对一的轮转交流，而非自然的异步群聊。随着AI助手在数字平台中普及，开发自然的人类化交互模式对于维持用户信任和参与度至关重要。

Method: HUMA采用事件驱动架构，包含路由器、行动代理和反思三个组件，能够处理消息、回复、反应，并引入逼真的响应时间模拟，使LLM适应群聊动态。

Result: 在97名参与者的四人角色扮演聊天研究中，参与者对AI和人类社区管理者的分类准确率接近随机水平，无法可靠区分HUMA代理与人类。主观体验在两种条件下相当，社区管理者有效性、社交存在感和参与度/满意度差异很小。

Conclusion: 在自然群聊环境中，AI协调者可以达到人类质量水平，同时难以被识别为非人类。

Abstract: Conversational agents built on large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet most systems are designed for one-on-one, turn-based exchanges rather than natural, asynchronous group chats. As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.
  We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes. Our results suggest that, in natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究普通话单音节词在自发对话中音高轮廓的实现方式，特别关注词义对音高轮廓的影响，挑战传统的声调理论。

Method: 使用广义加性模型将观察到的音高轮廓分解为与不同控制变量和语义预测因子相关的组成部分，分析词义、词义感知、同音异义词等因素对音高轮廓的影响。

Result: 研究结果显示词义对音高实现有显著影响，词义感知比词本身是更好的预测因子，同音异义词具有不同的音高轮廓，且通过上下文嵌入可以准确预测单个词标记的音高轮廓。

Conclusion: 研究结论支持词义在普通话声调实现中的重要作用，这些发现虽然挑战传统声调理论，但与判别性词汇模型的理论框架相吻合。

Abstract: We present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of words' meanings. We used the generalized additive model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours that are tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline. For phonetics, distributional semantics is a new kid on the block. Although our findings challenge standard theories of Mandarin tone, they fit well within the theoretical framework of the Discriminative Lexicon Model.

Abstract: We propose a zero-shot method for Natural Language Inference (NLI) that leverages multimodal representations by grounding language in visual contexts. Our approach generates visual representations of premises using text-to-image models and performs inference by comparing these representations with textual hypotheses. We evaluate two inference techniques: cosine similarity and visual question answering. Our method achieves high accuracy without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness against textual biases and surface heuristics. Additionally, we design a controlled adversarial dataset to validate the robustness of our approach. Our findings suggest that leveraging visual modality as a meaning representation provides a promising direction for robust natural language understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到线性变换器中选择性门控机制能改善语言任务的启发，作者希望将输入相关的旋转机制引入位置编码，以增强位置信息的表达能力。

Method: 提出了Selective RoPE方法，这是一种输入相关的旋转位置嵌入机制，允许在任意角度进行旋转，并揭示了softmax注意力中隐藏的旋转结构。

Result: 实验验证表明，Selective RoPE在语言建模和困难序列任务（如复制、状态跟踪和检索）上都能提高性能。

Conclusion: Selective RoPE成功地将输入相关的旋转机制引入位置编码，为变换器模型提供了更灵活和有效的位置表示方法。

Abstract: Position information is essential for language modeling. In softmax transformers, Rotary Position Embeddings (\textit{RoPE}) encode positions through \textit{fixed-angle} rotations, while in linear transformers, order is handled via input-dependent (selective) gating that decays past key-value associations. Selectivity has generally been shown to improve language-related tasks. Inspired by this, we introduce \textit{Selective RoPE}, an \textit{input-dependent} rotary embedding mechanism, that generalizes \textit{RoPE}, and enables rotation in \textit{arbitrary angles} for both linear and softmax transformers. We show that softmax attention already performs a hidden form of these rotations on query-key pairs, uncovering an implicit positional structure. We further show that in state-space models and gated linear transformers, the real part manages forgetting while the imaginary part encodes positions through rotations. We validate our method by equipping gated transformers with \textit{Selective RoPE}, demonstrating that its input-dependent rotations improve performance in language modeling and on difficult sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval.

TL;DR: 提出了ReVeL框架，将多项选择题改写为开放式问题，以解决MCQA中选项泄露信号导致评估不准确的问题，并在训练和评估中显示出更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多项选择题(MCQA)的选项可能泄露可利用信号，使得准确率指标无法真实反映模型能力，并鼓励在强化微调中出现猜测行为。

Method: ReVeL框架将MCQA问题分类并重写为开放式问题，保持答案可验证性，使用GRPO方法对Qwen2.5-VL模型进行微调。

Result: 在多项选择基准测试中达到相同准确率，开放式问题准确率提升约6个百分点；评估时发现MCQA基准测试分数膨胀高达20个百分点，同时提高判断准确性并降低成本。

Conclusion: ReVeL框架能更有效地评估和训练多模态语言模型，提供更可靠的数据效率和奖励信号，代码和数据将公开发布。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) has been a popular format for evaluating and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) of modern multimodal language models. Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency. We will release code and data publicly.

TL;DR: SMILE是一个新的评估指标，结合了句子级语义理解、关键词级语义理解和简单关键词匹配，在文本、图像和视频问答任务中与人类判断高度相关且计算轻量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标如ROUGE、METEOR和EM过度依赖n-gram词汇相似性，忽略了深层语义理解；BERTScore和MoverScore虽然使用上下文嵌入，但缺乏平衡句子级和关键词级语义的灵活性；基于大语言模型的评估器存在成本高、偏见、不一致和幻觉等问题。

Method: 提出SMILE方法，整合词汇精确性和语义相关性，通过结合句子级语义理解、关键词级语义理解和简单关键词匹配来构建综合评估指标。

Result: 在文本、图像和视频问答任务的广泛基准测试中，SMILE与人类判断高度相关，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: SMILE成功弥合了词汇评估和语义评估之间的差距，提供了一个全面、平衡且计算轻量的评估解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional evaluation metrics for textual and visual question answering, like ROUGE, METEOR, and Exact Match (EM), focus heavily on n-gram based lexical similarity, often missing the deeper semantic understanding needed for accurate assessment. While measures like BERTScore and MoverScore leverage contextual embeddings to address this limitation, they lack flexibility in balancing sentence-level and keyword-level semantics and ignore lexical similarity, which remains important. Large Language Model (LLM) based evaluators, though powerful, come with drawbacks like high costs, bias, inconsistency, and hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce SMILE: Semantic Metric Integrating Lexical Exactness, a novel approach that combines sentence-level semantic understanding with keyword-level semantic understanding and easy keyword matching. This composite method balances lexical precision and semantic relevance, offering a comprehensive evaluation. Extensive benchmarks across text, image, and video QA tasks show SMILE is highly correlated with human judgments and computationally lightweight, bridging the gap between lexical and semantic evaluation.

TL;DR: MR-RLVR通过掩码填充和步骤重排序构建过程级自监督奖励，在仅结果可验证的数学推理任务中显著提升RLVR性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR在定理证明等数学推理任务中可扩展性有限，因为中间推理过程至关重要但最终答案难以直接可靠验证，而token级SFT容易退化为机械记忆

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：先在数学计算和证明数据上进行自监督训练（掩码填充和步骤重排序），然后在仅结果可验证的数学计算数据集上进行RLVR微调

Result: 在固定采样和解码预算下，MR-RLVR相比原始RLVR在AIME24、AIME25、AMC23和MATH500上平均相对提升：Pass@1 +9.86%、Pass@5 +5.27%、Pass@8 +4.00%

Conclusion: 融入过程感知的自监督信号能有效增强RLVR在仅结果可验证场景下的可扩展性和性能

Abstract: Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.

Conclusion: PepBridge代表了在自上而下蛋白质结构联合设计方面的重大进展。

Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are governed by surface complementarity and hydrophobic interactions at protein interfaces. However, designing diverse and physically realistic protein structure and surfaces that precisely complement target receptors remains a significant challenge in computational protein design. In this work, we introduce PepBridge, a novel framework for the joint design of protein surface and structure that seamlessly integrates receptor surface geometry and biochemical properties. Starting with a receptor surface represented as a 3D point cloud, PepBridge generates complete protein structures through a multi-step process. First, it employs denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) to map receptor surfaces to ligand surfaces. Next, a multi-model diffusion model predicts the corresponding structure, while Shape-Frame Matching Networks ensure alignment between surface geometry and backbone architecture. This integrated approach facilitates surface complementarity, conformational stability, and chemical feasibility. Extensive validation across diverse protein design scenarios demonstrates PepBridge's efficacy in generating structurally viable proteins, representing a significant advancement in the joint design of top-down protein structure.

Conclusion: DDTime为时间序列数据集蒸馏提供了一个有效且高效的解决方案，通过频域对齐和多样性增强机制成功解决了时间序列特有的挑战，在保持轻量级的同时显著提升了预测精度。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is fundamental across many domains, yet training accurate models often requires large-scale datasets and substantial computational resources. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.
  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and diverse forecasting architectures demonstrate that DDTime consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, achieving about 30% relative accuracy gains while introducing about 2.49% computational overhead. All code and distilled datasets will be released.

Conclusion: 本文为深度平衡模型的梯度下降训练动态提供了严格的理论保证，在线性和单索引模型设置下证明了其良好的收敛性质，填补了该领域的理论空白。

Abstract: Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for training infinitely deep weight-tied neural networks that achieve state of the art performance across many modern machine learning tasks. Despite their practical success, theoretically understanding the gradient descent dynamics for training DEQs remains an area of active research. In this work, we rigorously study the gradient descent dynamics for DEQs in the simple setting of linear models and single-index models, filling several gaps in the literature. We prove a conservation law for linear DEQs which implies that the parameters remain trapped on spheres during training and use this property to show that gradient flow remains well-conditioned for all time. We then prove linear convergence of gradient descent to a global minimizer for linear DEQs and deep equilibrium single-index models under appropriate initialization and with a sufficiently small step size. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through experiments.

Method: 通过系统实验比较不同图结构编码策略，包括模板化图提示和GNN编码结构信息等方法，评估LLM在文本属性图上的表现。

Result: LLMs仅使用节点文本描述就能在各项任务中取得强劲性能，大多数结构编码策略只带来边际收益或负面影响，显式结构先验在强大语言模型下往往不必要甚至适得其反。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了结构对LLM图推理有益的传统假设，为基于语义驱动的图学习方法开辟了新途径，需要在LLM时代重新思考结构的表示和利用方式。

Abstract: Graphs provide a unified representation of semantic content and relational structure, making them a natural fit for domains such as molecular modeling, citation networks, and social graphs. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era. Our study is to systematically challenge the foundational assumption that structure is inherently beneficial for LLM-based graph reasoning, opening the door to new, semantics-driven approaches for graph learning.

Abstract: Recently, structure-text contrastive learning has shown promising performance on text-attributed graphs by leveraging the complementary strengths of graph neural networks and language models. However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: SAVeD在数据集版本检测方面表现出色，相比未训练基线和现有最先进方法如Starmie，实现了竞争性或更优的结果。

Abstract: Our work introduces SAVeD (Semantically Aware Version Detection), a contrastive learning-based framework for identifying versions of structured datasets without relying on metadata, labels, or integration-based assumptions. SAVeD addresses a common challenge in data science of repeated labor due to a difficulty of similar work or transformations on datasets. SAVeD employs a modified SimCLR pipeline, generating augmented table views through random transformations (e.g., row deletion, encoding perturbations). These views are embedded via a custom transformer encoder and contrasted in latent space to optimize semantic similarity. Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables. We evaluate performance using validation accuracy and separation, defined respectively as the proportion of correctly classified version/non-version pairs on a hold-out set, and the difference between average similarities of versioned and non-versioned tables (defined by a benchmark, and not provided to the model). Our experiments span five canonical datasets from the Semantic Versioning in Databases Benchmark, and demonstrate substantial gains post-training. SAVeD achieves significantly higher accuracy on completely unseen tables in, and a significant boost in separation scores, confirming its capability to distinguish semantically altered versions. Compared to untrained baselines and prior state-of-the-art dataset-discovery methods like Starmie, our custom encoder achieves competitive or superior results.

TL;DR: FlashCache是一个基于频域分析和异常KV感知的多模态KV缓存压缩框架，通过识别和保留关键异常KV对，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升推理速度并降低内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在显著的推理开销问题，因为多模态KV缓存随视觉输入长度线性增长。现有的压缩方法大多依赖注意力分数，与高效注意力内核不兼容且忽略了值向量对注意力输出的贡献。

Method: 1. 从KV矩阵分布角度分析，发现多模态KV矩阵的频域能量主要集中于低频；2. 提出异常KV识别模块，在频域中建模KV矩阵主成分，优先保留显著偏离主成分的KV对；3. 设计动态预算分配模块，自适应确定每层KV缓存大小以保留更多异常KV。

Result: 在多个MLLM和基准测试上的实验表明，FlashCache优于最先进的多模态KV压缩方法，解码速度提升高达1.69倍，KV内存使用降低80%，同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: FlashCache通过频域引导的异常KV感知压缩框架，有效解决了多模态KV缓存压缩问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models suffer from substantial inference overhead since multimodal KV Cache grows proportionally with the visual input length. Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.

Motivation: 现有的非对比自监督学习方法主要关注表示的一阶和二阶统计特性，但忽略了底层数据流形的局部几何结构。

Method: 在Barlow Twins风格冗余减少损失的基础上，添加基于曲率的正则化器。将每个嵌入视为顶点，通过余弦交互计算k近邻的离散曲率得分，并在增强视图间对齐和去相关这些曲率得分。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，使用ResNet-18骨干网络，曲率正则化的自监督学习相比Barlow Twins和VICReg具有竞争性或改进的线性评估性能。

Conclusion: 显式塑造局部几何结构是对纯统计自监督学习正则化的简单有效补充。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently advanced through non-contrastive methods that couple an invariance term with variance, covariance, or redundancy-reduction penalties. While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg. Our results indicate that explicitly shaping local geometry is a simple and effective complement to purely statistical SSL regularizers.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) tasks impose a strict logical constraint: a bag is labeled positive if and only if at least one instance within it is positive. While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation. This work offers a principled, interpretable, and effective alternative to existing MIL approaches that rely on learned heuristics.

Abstract: In the context of the growing proliferation of user devices and the concurrent surge in data volumes, the complexities arising from the substantial increase in data have posed formidable challenges to conventional machine learning model training. Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, our objective is to illuminate the performance nuances of these FL methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the domain.

Motivation: 扩散模型图像生成的计算需求快速增长，引发对能耗和环境影响的担忧，但缺乏跨模型配置和硬件设置的能耗预测方法。

Method: 将扩散模型推理分解为文本编码、迭代去噪和解码组件，假设去噪操作主导能耗，在四种扩散模型和三种GPU架构上进行全面实验。

Conclusion: 验证了扩散推理的计算受限特性，为可持续AI部署规划和碳足迹估算提供基础。

Abstract: The rapidly growing computational demands of diffusion models for image generation have raised significant concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.

Motivation: 现有评估指标如LAB-Bench、BioLP-bench和WMDP能够可靠评估模型提升能力和领域知识，但需要更好地量化"真实世界风险"的指标，以及可扩展的开放式指标来跟上LLM的快速发展

Method: 引入MOCET指标，这是一种可解释且双重可扩展（可自动化和开放式）的指标

Result: MOCET能够量化真实世界风险，特别是针对ASL-3+模型提升非国家行为者能力的风险

Conclusion: MOCET解决了现有评估指标在量化真实世界风险和可扩展性方面的不足，为LLM安全案例提供了更好的风险评估工具

Abstract: Evaluating and measuring AI Safety Level (ASL) threats are crucial for guiding stakeholders to implement safeguards that keep risks within acceptable limits. ASL-3+ models present a unique risk in their ability to uplift novice non-state actors, especially in the realm of biosecurity. Existing evaluation metrics, such as LAB-Bench, BioLP-bench, and WMDP, can reliably assess model uplift and domain knowledge. However, metrics that better contextualize "real-world risks" are needed to inform the safety case for LLMs, along with scalable, open-ended metrics to keep pace with their rapid advancements. To address both gaps, we introduce MOCET, an interpretable and doubly-scalable metric (automatable and open-ended) that can quantify real-world risks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ManifoldFormer是一个几何深度学习框架，通过显式学习神经流形表示来解决现有EEG基础模型忽略神经动态内在几何结构的问题，在四个公共数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型将神经信号视为欧几里得空间中的通用时间序列，忽略了神经动态的内在几何结构，这种基本不匹配限制了表示质量和跨被试泛化能力。

Method: 集成三个关键创新：用于保持几何结构的黎曼VAE流形嵌入、直接在神经流形上操作的具有测地线感知注意力机制的几何Transformer，以及利用神经ODE进行流形约束时间演化的动态预测器。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上评估显示，相比最先进方法准确率提高4.6-4.8%，Cohen's Kappa提高6.2-10.2%，同时保持强大的跨被试泛化能力。

Conclusion: 几何方法揭示了与神经生理学原理一致的有意义神经模式，确立了几何约束对于有效EEG基础模型的重要性。

Abstract: Existing EEG foundation models mainly treat neural signals as generic time series in Euclidean space, ignoring the intrinsic geometric structure of neural dynamics that constrains brain activity to low-dimensional manifolds. This fundamental mismatch between model assumptions and neural geometry limits representation quality and cross-subject generalization. ManifoldFormer addresses this limitation through a novel geometric deep learning framework that explicitly learns neural manifold representations. The architecture integrates three key innovations: a Riemannian VAE for manifold embedding that preserves geometric structure, a geometric Transformer with geodesic-aware attention mechanisms operating directly on neural manifolds, and a dynamics predictor leveraging neural ODEs for manifold-constrained temporal evolution. Extensive evaluation across four public datasets demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 4.6-4.8% higher accuracy and 6.2-10.2% higher Cohen's Kappa, while maintaining robust cross-subject generalization. The geometric approach reveals meaningful neural patterns consistent with neurophysiological principles, establishing geometric constraints as essential for effective EEG foundation models.

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了六种序列模型在瑞典心衰队列中的表现，发现Llama（Transformer++）在三个一年期预测任务中表现最佳，其次是Mamba架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer和Mamba架构在临床预测任务中表现出色，但医学领域缺乏系统分析模型性能和效率的方法。

Method: 在42820名瑞典心衰患者队列中，比较了三种架构类别（Transformers、Transformers++、Mambas）的六种序列模型，评估三个一年期预测任务，并进行输入序列、模型配置和时间预处理的消融研究。

Result: Llama获得最高的预测区分度和最佳校准，在所有任务中表现稳健；Mamba次之。两种架构都展示了高效的表征学习能力，小型配置超越其他大型Transformer。在相同模型大小下，Llama和Mamba使用25%更少的训练数据即可达到优越性能。

Conclusion: 本研究为临床预测任务提供了首个系统性的消融研究框架，包括输入标记化、模型配置和时间数据预处理的设计选择，可作为未来模型开发的起点。

Abstract: Transformers have defined the state-of-the-art for clinical prediction tasks involving electronic health records (EHRs). The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data. This paper presents a first ablation study with systematic design choices for input tokenization, model configuration and temporal data preprocessing. Future model development in clinical prediction tasks using EHRs could build upon this study's recommendation as a starting point.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了模型无关、分布自由的序数共形预测框架，实现了实例级最优预测区间和更好的覆盖效率权衡

Abstract: Ordinal classification has been widely applied in many high-stakes applications, e.g., medical imaging and diagnosis, where reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for decision making. Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).

Abstract: Monitoring aquatic species, especially elusive ones like lobsters, presents challenges. This study focuses on Homarus gammarus (European lobster), a key species for fisheries and aquaculture, and leverages non-invasive Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM). Understanding lobster habitats, welfare, reproduction, sex, and age is crucial for management and conservation. While bioacoustic emissions have classified various aquatic species using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, this research specifically uses H. gammarus bioacoustics (buzzing/carapace vibrations) to classify lobsters by age (juvenile/adult) and sex (male/female).
  The dataset was collected at Johnshaven, Scotland, using hydrophones in concrete tanks. We explored the efficacy of Deep Learning (DL) models (1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN) and six Machine Learning (ML) models (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP). Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as features.
  For age classification (adult vs. juvenile), most models achieved over 97% accuracy (Naive Bayes: 91.31%). For sex classification, all models except Naive Bayes surpassed 93.23%. These strong results demonstrate the potential of supervised ML and DL to extract age- and sex-related features from lobster sounds. This research offers a promising non-invasive PAM approach for lobster conservation, detection, and management in aquaculture and fisheries, enabling real-world edge computing applications for underwater species.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在听觉领域，自监督音频模型的性能提升会使其内部表征与大脑活动更加相似，这种脑相似性是学习重建自然音频数据时的涌现特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人工神经网络在任务性能提升时，其内部表征是否也会与大脑信号更加相似，特别是在听觉领域。

Method: 使用36种不同音频模型，通过体素回归、成分回归和表征相似性分析，比较模型内部表征与两个独立fMRI数据集的大脑活动对齐程度，并在HEAREval基准的6个听觉任务中评估模型性能。

Result: 发现近期自监督音频模型比旧模型和专用模型更能预测听觉皮层活动，模型整体任务性能与大脑表征对齐度呈强正相关（r>0.7），且EnCodecMAE预训练过程中脑相似性会逐渐增加。

Conclusion: 脑相似表征可以是学习重建自然音频数据时的涌现副产品，无需专门优化即可获得。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are increasingly powerful models of brain computation, yet it remains unclear whether improving their task performance also makes their internal representations more similar to brain signals. To address this question in the auditory domain, we quantified the alignment between the internal representations of 36 different audio models and brain activity from two independent fMRI datasets. Using voxel-wise and component-wise regression, and representation similarity analysis (RSA), we found that recent self-supervised audio models with strong performance in diverse downstream tasks are better predictors of auditory cortex activity than older and more specialized models. To assess the quality of the audio representations, we evaluated these models in 6 auditory tasks from the HEAREval benchmark, spanning music, speech, and environmental sounds. This revealed strong positive Pearson correlations ($r>0.7$) between a model's overall task performance and its alignment with brain representations. Finally, we analyzed the evolution of the similarity between audio and brain representations during the pretraining of EnCodecMAE. We discovered that brain similarity increases progressively and emerges early during pretraining, despite the model not being explicitly optimized for this objective. This suggests that brain-like representations can be an emergent byproduct of learning to reconstruct missing information from naturalistic audio data.

Conclusion: 研究证实了DNN在利用语音生物标志物进行神经退行性疾病早期检测方面的效率和潜力，能提供更高的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that, in addition to directly impairing functional mobility, is frequently associated with vocal impairments such as hypophonia and dysarthria, which typically manifest in the early stages. The use of vocal biomarkers to support the early diagnosis of PD presents a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible alternative in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, using vocal biomarkers. Two publicly available voice datasets were used. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\%$ and $92.11\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies. Overall, this study confirms the efficiency of DNNs and emphasizes their potential to provide greater accuracy and reliability for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases using voice-based biomarkers.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning promises, among other benefits, to efficiently capture and utilize the temporal structure of a decision-making problem and to enhance continual learning capabilities, but theoretical guarantees lag behind practice. In this paper, we propose a Feudal Q-learning scheme and investigate under which conditions its coupled updates converge and are stable. By leveraging the theory of Stochastic Approximation and the ODE method, we present a theorem stating the convergence and stability properties of Feudal Q-learning. This provides a principled convergence and stability analysis tailored to Feudal RL. Moreover, we show that the updates converge to a point that can be interpreted as an equilibrium of a suitably defined game, opening the door to game-theoretic approaches to Hierarchical RL. Lastly, experiments based on the Feudal Q-learning algorithm support the outcomes anticipated by theory.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks rely on local message passing, which limits their ability to model long-range dependencies in graphs. Existing approaches extend this range through continuous-time dynamics or dense self-attention, but both suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability. We propose Topologic Attention Networks, a new framework that applies topologic attention, a probabilistic mechanism that learns how information should flow through both direct and indirect connections in a graph. Unlike conventional attention that depends on explicit pairwise interactions, topologic attention emerges from the learned information propagation of the graph, enabling unified reasoning over local and global relationships. This method achieves provides state-of-the-art performance across all measured baseline models. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Marshall-Rosenhoover/Topologic-Attention-Networks.

Abstract: It is known that reinforcement learning (RL) is data-hungry. To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.

Motivation: 现有LLM选择方法通常优化单一目标（如性能或成本），无法从交互数据中学习个体用户偏好，而用户偏好因性能、成本和响应风格而异

Method: 将交互数据转换为异构图，通过图神经网络捕捉用户查询与最优LLM之间的上下文关系，设计了多成本效率模拟和LLM-as-a-Judge两种评估策略

Result: 在PersonaRoute-Bench基准测试中，比最强方法分别提升15.38%和9.83%，在1000用户场景下提升16.19%和59.69%，同时保持更高效率

Conclusion: PersonalizedRouter在个性化LLM选择方面表现优异，具有强大的少样本泛化能力，适应新用户和新LLM时能达到全训练模型性能的64.81%和85.80%

Abstract: The growing number of Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities and response styles provides users with a wider range of choices, which presents challenges in selecting appropriate LLMs, as user preferences vary in terms of performance, cost, and response style. Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency. Moreover, PersonalizedRouter demonstrates strong few-shot generalization, achieving 64.81% and 85.80% of the fully trained model's performance when adapting to new users and new LLMs.

Motivation: 广告领域早期发现潜力人才至关重要，研究旨在探索结合社交媒体和传统媒体数据预测艺人走红时间的有效性。

Method: 定义了人才爆发的概念，实验比较了传统时间序列模型、神经网络和集成学习方法，利用Twitter和电视数据进行预测。

Result: 集成学习方法在标准回归指标上表现最好，但神经网络在人才爆发预测的精确率和召回率方面优于其他方法。

Abstract: Early detection of rising talents is of paramount importance in the field of advertising. In this paper, we define a concept of talent breakout and propose a method to detect Japanese talents before their rise to stardom. The main focus of the study is to determine the effectiveness of combining Twitter and TV data on predicting time-dependent changes in social data. Although traditional time-series models are known to be robust in many applications, the success of neural network models in various fields (e.g.\ Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning) continues to spark an interest in the time-series community to apply new techniques in practice. Therefore, in order to find the best modeling approach, we have experimented with traditional, neural network and ensemble learning methods. We observe that ensemble learning methods outperform traditional and neural network models based on standard regression metrics. However, by utilizing the concept of talent breakout, we are able to assess the true forecasting ability of the models, where neural networks outperform traditional and ensemble learning methods in terms of precision and recall.

TL;DR: PepEVOLVE是一个用于大环肽优化的动态框架，能够自动学习编辑位置并多目标优化肽序列，相比现有方法在Rev结合大环肽基准上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大环肽结合了生物制剂的亲和力与小分子的可开发性，但其巨大的组合空间和多参数目标使得先导优化过程缓慢且困难。现有方法需要预先指定可突变位置且优化算法有限。

Method: PepEVOLVE采用动态掩码和CHUCKLES移位增强预训练，使用上下文无关多臂老虎机路由器发现高奖励残基，结合进化优化算法和组相对优势稳定强化学习更新。

Result: 在Rev结合大环肽基准测试中，PepEVOLVE达到更高平均分数（约0.8 vs 0.6），最佳候选得分0.95（vs 0.87），且收敛步数更少。

Conclusion: PepEVOLVE为肽先导优化提供了实用且可复现的路径，能够在编辑位置未知时实现更高效的探索和多目标设计质量提升。

Abstract: Macrocyclic peptides are an emerging modality that combines biologics-like affinity with small-molecule-like developability, but their vast combinatorial space and multi-parameter objectives make lead optimization slow and challenging. Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints. Overall, PepEVOLVE offers a practical, reproducible path to peptide lead optimization when optimal edit sites are unknown, enabling more efficient exploration and improving design quality across multiple objectives.

Conclusion: CroTad框架能够有效解决轨迹异常检测中的关键挑战，提供无阈值、鲁棒的在线异常检测能力。

Abstract: Detecting trajectory anomalies is a vital task in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling the identification of unsafe, inefficient, or irregular travel behaviours. While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework across various evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出一种端到端分类管道，使用潜在ODE建模连续ECG波形，通过降采样创建鲁棒特征向量，在360Hz、90Hz和45Hz采样频率下性能下降极小，解决了可穿戴设备信号保真度与电池续航的权衡问题。

Motivation: 解决12导联ECG短期监测易错过间歇性事件，以及可穿戴ECG因电池限制导致采样频率不规则、形态分析困难的问题。

Method: 训练潜在ODE模型连续ECG波形，通过降采样（360Hz→90Hz→45Hz）构建三个潜在向量，使用梯度提升树进行分类，测试跨频率鲁棒性。

Result: 在360Hz、90Hz和45Hz采样频率下，宏平均AUC-ROC值分别为0.984、0.978和0.976，性能下降极小。

Conclusion: 该方法能够规避信号保真度与电池续航的权衡，使更小型可穿戴设备成为可能，促进长期心脏健康监测。

Abstract: 12-lead ECGs with high sampling frequency are the clinical gold standard for arrhythmia detection, but their short-term, spot-check nature often misses intermittent events. Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, making morphology analysis challenging. We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life. This enables smaller wearables, promoting long-term monitoring of cardiac health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动起草专利权利要求劳动密集、成本高且不一致，而传统LLM缺乏精确权利要求优化所需的结构化迭代推理能力。

Method: 将权利要求编辑重新定义为引导搜索问题，集成MCTS与多智能体系统（EditorAgent提出编辑，ExaminerAgent模拟审查员批判性分析新颖性和现有技术披露）。

Result: 在1145个权利要求基准测试中，ToC平均综合得分提升8%，某些情况下达9%，显著优于标准LLM。

Conclusion: ToC建立了一种透明、可控且可解释的方法论，有效桥接了先进LLM推理能力与战略MCTS规划，用于结构化专利权利要求优化。

Abstract: Optimizing patent claims is a critical yet challenging task, demanding careful balance between maximizing novelty and preserving legal scope. Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\%, and up to 9\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions. Overall, ToC establishes a transparent, controllable, and interpretable methodology that effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning capabilities with strategic MCTS planning for structured patent claim optimization.The source code is available at https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC.

Conclusion: FIRM在保持通信效率的同时有效解决了联邦多目标对齐问题，为LLM对齐提供了一种实用的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values often involves balancing multiple, conflicting objectives such as helpfulness and harmlessness. Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting. Empirically, we show that FIRM leads to smoother training dynamics, reduced client disagreement drift, and improved reward trade-offs compared to baselines. We further propose a method to incorporate a preference over the objectives and report empirical Pareto plots, demonstrating that FIRM can smoothly adapt trade-offs between objectives in response to specified preferences.

TL;DR: 提出EMTC方法，通过重要性感知的变量级掩码和多内生视图表示学习模块，解决多元时间序列聚类中冗余信息导致的性能瓶颈问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列包含大量冗余信息（如稳态机器运行记录、太阳能发电零输出期），这些冗余降低了模型对判别性时间戳的关注，导致聚类性能瓶颈

Method: EMTC方法包含重要性感知变量级掩码(IVM)和多内生视图(MEV)表示学习模块。IVM自适应引导模型学习更具判别性的聚类表示，MEV通过重建和对比学习路径增强泛化能力

Result: 在15个真实基准数据集上的实验表明，EMTC优于8种最先进方法，平均比最强基线提升4.85%

Conclusion: EMTC通过动态适应聚类关键时间戳的重要性，有效解决了多元时间序列聚类中的冗余问题，显著提升了聚类性能

Abstract: Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) clustering discovers intrinsic grouping patterns of temporal data samples. Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering. Extensive experiments on 15 real benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EMTC in comparison with eight SOTA methods, where the EMTC achieves an average improvement of 4.85% over the strongest baselines.

TL;DR: Step-E是一个将样本选择和模型学习集成到单一优化过程中的框架，通过基于损失排序逐步排除高损失样本来处理噪声标签和异常值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野外收集的训练数据通常包含噪声标签和异常值，这会严重降低深度神经网络的性能和可靠性。传统的数据清洗作为独立预处理阶段存在不足，无法充分利用下游模型的反馈，也无法适应未知的噪声模式。

Method: Step-E在每个epoch根据损失对样本排序，在短暂预热阶段后逐步增加从梯度更新中排除的高损失样本比例，形成在线课程学习，专注于简单和一致的样本，最终忽略持续存在的异常值。

Result: 在CIFAR-100N上，Step-E将ResNet-18模型的测试准确率从43.3%提升到50.4%，明显优于损失截断、自定步调学习和一次性过滤方法，接近干净标签oracle的60.5%。在CIFAR-10N(aggre)上，也从噪声基线的83.9%提升到85.3%，接近干净标签oracle的85.9%，且训练时间开销适中。

Conclusion: Step-E通过将样本选择与模型学习集成到单一优化过程中，有效处理了噪声标签问题，在多个数据集上显著提升了模型性能，接近干净标签的性能水平。

Abstract: Training data collected in the wild often contain noisy labels and outliers that substantially degrade the performance and reliability of deep neural networks. While data cleaning is commonly applied as a separate preprocessing stage, such two-stage pipelines neither fully exploit feedback from the downstream model nor adapt to unknown noise patterns. We propose Step-E, a simple framework that integrates sample selection and model learning into a single optimization process. At each epoch, Step-E ranks samples by loss and gradually increases the fraction of high-loss examples that are excluded from gradient updates after a brief warm-up stage, yielding an online curriculum that focuses on easy and consistent examples and eventually ignores persistent outliers. On CIFAR-100N, Step-E improves the test accuracy of a ResNet-18 model from 43.3% (+/- 0.7%) to 50.4% (+/- 0.9%), clearly outperforming loss truncation, self-paced learning, and one-shot filtering while approaching the clean-label oracle at 60.5% (+/- 0.2%). On CIFAR-10N (aggre), Step-E also improves over the noisy baseline (85.3% vs. 83.9%) and nearly matches the clean-label oracle (85.9%), with only moderate training-time overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子指纹方法使用哈希函数生成固定长度的分子向量表示，但哈希冲突会导致不同子结构被表示为相同特征，从而在分子相似性计算中产生高估。

Method: 使用精确指纹与标准压缩指纹在DOCKSTRING数据集的五个分子性质预测基准上进行对比，基于高斯过程作为预测模型。

Result: 精确指纹在分子性质预测准确性上产生了小幅但一致的改进，但这些增益并未转化为贝叶斯优化性能的显著提升。

Conclusion: 虽然精确指纹能提高分子性质预测的准确性，但这种改进在贝叶斯优化任务中并不显著。

Abstract: Molecular fingerprinting methods use hash functions to create fixed-length vector representations of molecules. However, hash collisions cause distinct substructures to be represented with the same feature, leading to overestimates in molecular similarity calculations. We investigate whether using exact fingerprints improves accuracy compared to standard compressed fingerprints in molecular property prediction and Bayesian optimization where the underlying predictive model is a Gaussian process. We find that using exact fingerprints yields a small yet consistent improvement in predictive accuracy on five molecular property prediction benchmarks from the DOCKSTRING dataset. However, these gains did not translate to significant improvements in Bayesian optimization performance.

Conclusion: LLM作为工具代理时确实会进行未经授权的举报行为，这种行为受多种因素影响，研究为理解和控制此类行为提供了实证基础。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as tool-using agents causes their alignment training to manifest in new ways. Recent work finds that language models can use tools in ways that contradict the interests or explicit instructions of the user. We study LLM whistleblowing: a subset of this behavior where models disclose suspected misconduct to parties beyond the dialog boundary (e.g., regulatory agencies) without user instruction or knowledge. We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates. Additionally, we verify the robustness of our dataset by testing for model evaluation awareness, and find that both black-box methods and probes on model activations show lower evaluation awareness in our settings than in comparable previous work.

Conclusion: 几何解缠方法提供了一种理论上有保证的简单解决方案，能够有效缓解遗忘过程中的副作用，同时保持遗忘效果

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the removal of a training subset's influence from a deployed model, is critical for privacy preservation and model reliability, yet gradient ascent on forget samples often harms retained knowledge. Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients ("retain-invariant"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects. GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP.

Method: 使用基于深度各向异性扩散模型的超分辨率算法，以MODIS LST数据为训练目标，结合高分辨率土地覆盖、数字高程和植被高度图作为指导，将AVHRR GAC数据从4公里降尺度到1公里。

Abstract: Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential climate variable (ECV) crucial for understanding land-atmosphere energy exchange and monitoring climate change, especially in the rapidly warming Arctic. Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps. The resulting dataset provides twice-daily, 1 km LST observations for the entire pan-Arctic region over four decades. This enhanced dataset enables improved modelling of permafrost, reconstruction of near-surface air temperature, and assessment of surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Additionally, it supports climate monitoring efforts in the pre-MODIS era and offers a framework adaptable to future satellite missions for thermal infrared observation and climate data record continuity.

Abstract: Surface Electromyography (sEMG) provides vital insights into muscle function, but it can be noisy and challenging to acquire. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) provide a robust and wearable alternative to motion capture systems. This paper investigates the synthesis of normalized sEMG signals from 6-axis IMU data using a deep learning approach. We collected simultaneous sEMG and IMU data sampled at 1~KHz for various arm movements. A Sliding-Window-Wave-Net model, based on dilated causal convolutions, was trained to map the IMU data to the sEMG signal. The results show that the model successfully predicts the timing and general shape of muscle activations. Although peak amplitudes were often underestimated, the high temporal fidelity demonstrates the feasibility of using this method for muscle intent detection in applications such as prosthetics and rehabilitation biofeedback.

Method: 首先在低维代理空间进行三角剖分建立邻接索引，然后反向投影到原始空间进行鲁棒的边修剪、合并和异常检测。

Result: DelTriC在多个场景中优于k-means、DBSCAN和HDBSCAN等传统方法，具有可扩展性和准确性，并显著改善异常检测。

Conclusion: DelTriC通过解耦邻域构建和决策制定，提供了一种有效的高维数据聚类解决方案。

Abstract: The paper introduces DelTriC (Delaunay Triangulation Clustering), a clustering algorithm which integrates PCA/UMAP-based projection, Delaunay triangulation, and a novel back-projection mechanism to form clusters in the original high-dimensional space. DelTriC decouples neighborhood construction from decision-making by first triangulating in a low-dimensional proxy to index local adjacency, and then back-projecting to the original space to perform robust edge pruning, merging, and anomaly detection. DelTriC can outperform traditional methods such as k-means, DBSCAN, and HDBSCAN in many scenarios; it is both scalable and accurate, and it also significantly improves outlier detection.

Motivation: 过渡态对于理解反应机理至关重要，但实验和计算方法复杂且有限，需要开发更高效的过渡态预测方法。

Method: 提出TS-DFM流匹配框架，在分子距离几何空间中运行，设计了TSDVNet网络结构学习速度场以准确生成过渡态几何结构。

Result: 在Transition1X基准数据集上，TS-DFM比之前最优方法React-OT的结构精度提高了30%，预测的过渡态能加速CI-NEB优化收敛，并能发现替代反应路径和更低能垒的过渡态。

Conclusion: TS-DFM在未见过的分子和反应类型上表现出强大的泛化能力，具有促进反应探索的潜力。

Abstract: Transition states (TSs) are crucial for understanding reaction mechanisms, yet their exploration is limited by the complexity of experimental and computational approaches. Here we propose TS-DFM, a flow matching framework that predicts TSs from reactants and products. By operating in molecular distance geometry space, TS-DFM explicitly captures the dynamic changes of interatomic distances in chemical reactions. A network structure named TSDVNet is designed to learn the velocity field for generating TS geometries accurately. On the benchmark dataset Transition1X, TS-DFM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method React-OT by 30\% in structural accuracy. These predicted TSs provide high-quality initial structures, accelerating the convergence of CI-NEB optimization. Additionally, TS-DFM can identify alternative reaction paths. In our experiments, even a more favorable TS with lower energy barrier is discovered. Further tests on RGD1 dataset confirm its strong generalization ability on unseen molecules and reaction types, highlighting its potential for facilitating reaction exploration.

Motivation: 当前最先进的3D从头设计流匹配或扩散模型仅限于生成单一构象，但分子的构象景观决定了其可观测性质和与蛋白质靶标的结合能力。通过生成一组代表性的低能构象异构体，可以更直接地评估这些性质，并可能提高生成具有所需热力学可观测值分子的能力。

Conclusion: FlexiFlow可以成功转移到蛋白质条件配体生成任务，即使数据集仅包含静态口袋而没有伴随构象。

Abstract: Sampling useful three-dimensional molecular structures along with their most favorable conformations is a key challenge in drug discovery. Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time. Finally, FlexiFlow can be successfully transferred to the protein-conditioned ligand generation task, even when the dataset contains only static pockets without accompanying conformations.

Method: 使用非线性优化投影和基于局部线性化的投影（利用Jacobian-vector和vector-Jacobian乘积），对近似解进行后处理投影。

Result: 两种投影方法都能显著减少约束违反，并在物理信息基准上提高准确性。

Conclusion: 这两种无需训练的后处理投影方法能有效改善神经PDE求解器的约束满足性和精度。

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers used for scientific simulation often violate governing equation constraints. While linear constraints can be projected cheaply, many constraints are nonlinear, complicating projection onto the feasible set. Dynamical PDEs are especially difficult because constraints induce long-range dependencies in time. In this work, we evaluate two training-free, post hoc projections of approximate solutions: a nonlinear optimization-based projection, and a local linearization-based projection using Jacobian-vector and vector-Jacobian products. We analyze constraints across representative PDEs and find that both projections substantially reduce violations and improve accuracy over physics-informed baselines.

Abstract: Premium automotive manufacturers face increasingly complex forecasting challenges due to high product variety, sparse variant-level data, and volatile market dynamics. This study addresses monthly automobile demand forecasting across a multi-product, multi-market, and multi-level hierarchy using data from a German premium manufacturer. The methodology combines point and probabilistic forecasts across strategic and operational planning levels, leveraging ensembles of LightGBM models with pooled training sets, quantile regression, and a mixed-integer linear programming reconciliation approach. Results highlight that spatiotemporal dependencies, as well as rounding bias, significantly affect forecast accuracy, underscoring the importance of integer forecasts for operational feasibility. Shapley analysis shows that short-term demand is reactive, shaped by life cycle maturity, autoregressive momentum, and operational signals, whereas medium-term demand reflects anticipatory drivers such as online engagement, planning targets, and competitive indicators, with online behavioral data considerably improving accuracy at disaggregated levels.

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as an effective technique for fine-tuning large-scale foundation models for downstream tasks. However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of ReBaPL on several benchmark datasets, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for prompt learning.

Abstract: Computing worst-case robust strategies in pursuit-evasion games (PEGs) is time-consuming, especially when real-world factors like partial observability are considered. While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解优化算法如何偏好平坦极小值提供了统一的理论基础，特别是在过参数化神经网络中。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of optimization in deep learning is increasingly important as models scale. While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants reliably find solutions that generalize well, the mechanisms driving this generalization remain unclear. Notably, these algorithms often prefer flatter or simpler minima, particularly in overparameterized settings. Prior work has linked flatness to generalization, and methods like Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) explicitly encourage flatness, but a unified theory connecting data structure, optimization dynamics, and the nature of learned solutions is still lacking. In this work, we develop a linear stability framework that analyzes the behavior of SGD, random perturbations, and SAM, particularly in two layer ReLU networks. Central to our analysis is a coherence measure that quantifies how gradient curvature aligns across data points, revealing why certain minima are stable and favored during training.

Conclusion: 该框架通过后验采样方法有效解决了核心集选择中的挑战，在数据预算有限的情况下提供了稳定且高效的训练加速方案。

Abstract: As deep learning models continue to scale, the growing computational demands have amplified the need for effective coreset selection techniques. Coreset selection aims to accelerate training by identifying small, representative subsets of data that approximate the performance of the full dataset. Among various approaches, gradient based methods stand out due to their strong theoretical underpinnings and practical benefits, particularly under limited data budgets. However, these methods face challenges such as naive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) acting as a surprisingly strong baseline and the breakdown of representativeness due to loss curvature mismatches over time.
  In this work, we propose a novel framework that addresses these limitations. First, we establish a connection between posterior sampling and loss landscapes, enabling robust coreset selection even in high data corruption scenarios. Second, we introduce a smoothed loss function based on posterior sampling onto the model weights, enhancing stability and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. We also present a novel convergence analysis for our sampling-based coreset selection method. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how our approach achieves faster training and enhanced generalization across diverse datasets than the current state of the art.

Abstract: Graph representation learning seeks to transform complex, high-dimensional graph structures into compact vector spaces that preserve both topology and semantics. Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime. These results highlight the potential of unified, single-phase discriminative mining as a foundation for scalable and interpretable graph representation learning.

Abstract: This paper addresses the cooperative Multi-Vehicle Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Stochastic Requests (MVDPDPSR) and proposes an end-to-end centralized decision-making framework based on sequence-to-sequence, named Multi-Agent Pointer Transformer (MAPT). MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration. Experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate that MAPT significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of performance and exhibits substantial computational time advantages compared to classical operations research methods.

Conclusion: 通过调节表示变化来稳定重要神经元的功能角色，InTAct实现了稳定性和可塑性之间的平衡。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable neural networks to acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks. By regulating representation changes where past knowledge is encoded, InTAct achieves a principled balance between stability and plasticity. Across diverse domain-incremental benchmarks, including DomainNet and ImageNet-R, InTAct consistently reduces representation drift and improves performance, increasing Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a cornerstone in biomolecular analysis, offering precise identification of pathogens through unique mass spectral signatures. Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions. By eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing, our method unlocks the potential for portable, deployable MALDI-MS platforms, revolutionizing environmental pathogen detection and rapid response to biological threats.

Conclusion: 该框架能够维持一致的画像对齐行为，同时从集体知识中受益，实现了有效的个性化AI代理。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for persona-based language model system, motivated by the need for personalized AI agents that adapt to individual user preferences. In our approach, the agent embodies the user's "persona" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge. On the LaMP benchmark, our method improves news categorization F1 by 11.1%, movie tagging F1 by 56.1%, and reduces product rating MAE by 10.4% over prior methods.

Abstract: The paper considers the problems of optimal vaccination control in the classical SIR model under constraints on the resource capabilities of the insurance medical system, in particular under constraints on the possible absolute rate of vaccination of the population and the limitation on the available number of vaccines. The application of classical optimal control methods, the dynamic programming method and the Pontryagin maximum principle for such a model encounters difficulties associated with the possible non-smoothness of the Bellman function, and in the Pontryagin method the problem is to solve a boundary value problem with discontinuous control. Therefore, in the paper, optimal control is sought in the class of the so-called parametric strategies, which reduces the original problem to a finite-dimensional optimization problem with respect to unknown parameters.

Abstract: Penalty-based methods have become popular for solving bilevel optimization (BLO) problems, thanks to their effective first-order nature. However, they often require inner-loop iterations to solve the lower-level (LL) problem and small outer-loop step sizes to handle the increased smoothness induced by large penalty terms, leading to suboptimal complexity. This work considers the general BLO problems with coupled constraints (CCs) and leverages a novel penalty reformulation that decouples the upper- and lower-level variables. This yields an improved analysis of the smoothness constant, enabling larger step sizes and reduced iteration complexity for Penalty-Based Gradient Descent algorithms in ALTernating fashion (ALT-PBGD). Building on the insight of reduced smoothness, we propose PBGD-Free, a novel fully single-loop algorithm that avoids inner loops for the uncoupled constraint BLO. For BLO with CCs, PBGD-Free employs an efficient inner-loop with substantially reduced iteration complexity. Furthermore, we propose a novel curvature condition describing the "flatness" of the upper-level objective with respect to the LL variable. This condition relaxes the traditional upper-level Lipschitz requirement, enables smaller penalty constant choices, and results in a negligible penalty gradient term during upper-level variable updates. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and validate the method's efficacy through hyperparameter optimization for support vector machines and fine-tuning of large language models.

Result: 计算实验表明，该方法能在18小时内解决包含1000个随机变量和15个高斯混合分量的复杂问题，满足高达0.999的约束满足概率，而样本平均逼近方法即使在较小问题上也无法提供有效解。

Conclusion: 提出的分段线性逼近方法为高斯混合分布下的机会约束问题提供了高效可行的求解方案，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: We study linear chance-constrained problems where the coefficients follow a Gaussian mixture distribution. We provide mixed-binary quadratic programs that give inner and outer approximations of the chance constraint based on piecewise linear approximations of the standard normal cumulative density function. We show that $O\left(\sqrt{\ln(1/τ)/τ} \right)$ pieces are sufficient to attain $τ$-accuracy in the chance constraint. We also show that any desired optimality gap can be achieved under a constraint qualification condition by controlling the approximation accuracy. Extensive computations using a commercial solver show that problems with up to one thousand random coefficients specified with up to fifteen Gaussian mixture components, generated under diverse settings, can be solved to near optimality within 18 hours, while satisfying chance constraint satisfaction probabilities of up to $0.999$. The solution times are significantly lower for problems with fewer random coefficients and mixture terms. For example, problems with one hundred random coefficients, ten mixture terms, and a constraint satisfaction probability of $0.999$ can be solved in a minute or less. Sample average approximations fail to provide meaningful solutions even for the smaller problems.

Abstract: Contextual stochastic optimization is an advanced methodology to model uncertainty in the presence of contextual information during decision planning processes. Although classical methodologies focus on minimizing the expectation of a random loss, in many applications, risk-averse decision-makers may be interested in minimizing a specific quantile as a more prudent alternative. In this paper, we propose a new risk-averse contextual stochastic optimization problem with a quantile objective for general two-stage problems. Given historical data on the model's random parameters and contextual information, we model the conditional quantile by replacing the conditional expectation in its variational characterization with a generic estimator. Under two sets of mild regularity conditions, we derive the asymptotic almost-sure convergence and convergence in probability of the optimal solution and the optimal value of the associated optimization problem to their true counterparts. Optimization problems with a quantile objective is usually non-convex, which are generally regarded as challenging to solve. To address the computational difficulties, we propose a new stochastic inexact constraint generation method with convergence guarantee. Finally, through numerical experiments on a single-server appointment scheduling problem, we study the computational performance of our proposed solution method as well as operational performance of our proposed methodology. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating useful contextual information and decision-maker's risk attitude into the optimization model.

It is further used to show that the only sparse spectrahedral cones that are homogeneous convex cones are those described by homogeneous chordal graphs.

Conclusion: 将扩散过程的鲁棒性框架扩展到具有交互连续和离散动态的混合系统，显著拓宽了鲁棒控制理论的应用范围

Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of stochastic optimal control for controlled regime switching diffusions. We consider systems driven by both continuous fluctuations and discrete regime changes, allowing for model misspecification in both the diffusion and switching components. Within a unified framework, we study four classical cost formulations finite horizon, infinite-horizon discounted and ergodic costs, and the exit time cost, and establish continuity of value functions and robustness of optimal controls. Specifically, we show that as a sequence of approximating regime switching models converges to the true model, the associated value functions and optimal policies converge as well, ensuring vanishing performance loss. The analysis relies on the regularity of the solution to the associated weakly coupled HJB systems, and their stochastic representation. The results extend the robustness framework developed for diffusion processes to a significantly broader class of hybrid systems with interacting continuous and discrete dynamics.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the multiple probabilistic covering location problem (MPCLP), which attempts to open a fixed number of facilities to maximize the total covered customer demand under a joint probabilistic coverage setting. We present a new mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation, and develop an efficient linear programming (LP) based branch-and-cut (B&C) algorithm where submodular and outer-approximation inequalities are used to replace the nonlinear constraints and are separated at the nodes of the search tree. One key advantage of the proposed B&C algorithm is that the number of variables in the underlying formulation grows only linearly with the number of customers and facility locations and is one-order of magnitude smaller than that in the underlying formulation of a state-of-the-art B&C algorithm in the literature. Moreover, we propose two new families of strong valid inequalities, called enhanced outer-approximation and lifted subadditive inequalities, to strengthen the LP relaxation and speed up the convergence of the proposed B&C algorithm. In extensive computational experiments on a testbed of 240 benchmark MPCLP instances, we show that, thanks to the small problem size and the strong LP relaxation of the underlying formulation, the proposed B&C algorithm significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art B&C algorithm in terms of running time, number of nodes in the search tree, and number of solved instances. In particular, using the proposed B&C algorithm, we are able to provide optimal solutions for 57 previously unsolved benchmark instances within a time limit of one hour.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于Güler型加速技术的三种加速算法：GPGM、GLALM和GLADMM，通过利用负项信息设计外推步骤，实现了对偶变量的同时加速，并在数值实验中表现出优于现有方法的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加速算法未能充分利用负项信息，本文旨在将Güler加速技术应用于梯度类算法，为算法构建提供统一简洁的框架。

Method: 利用负项-||x^k-\hat{x}^{k-1}||^2的信息设计外推步骤，提出了GPGM、GLALM和GLADMM三种加速算法，其中GLALM和GLADMM能同时加速原始变量和对偶变量。

Result: GPGM和GLALM达到O(1/k^2)收敛速率，GLADMM总收敛速率为O(1/N)，部分收敛速率从O(1/N^{3/2})提升到O(1/N^2)。数值实验在逻辑回归、二次规划和压缩感知问题上验证了算法的高效性。

Conclusion: Güler加速技术可有效应用于梯度类算法，所提算法在效率和收敛性能上优于现有方法，其随机版本在统计、机器学习和数据挖掘领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Güler-type acceleration technique and utilize it to propose three acceleration algorithms: the Güler-type accelerated proximal gradient method (GPGM), the Güler-type accelerated linearized augmented Lagrangian method (GLALM) and the Güler-type accelerated linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (GLADMM). The key idea behind these algorithms is to fully leverage the information of negative term \bm{$-\|x^k-\hat{x}^{k-1}\|^2$} in order to design the extrapolation step. This concept of using negative terms to improve acceleration can be extended to other algorithms as well. Moreover, the proposed GLALM and GLADMM enable simultaneous acceleration of both primal and dual variables. Additionally, GPGM and GLALM achieve the same convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{k^2})$ with some existing results. Although GLADMM achieves the same total convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{N})$ as in existing results, the partial convergence rate is improved from $O(\frac{1}{N^{3/2}})$ to $O(\frac{1}{N^2})$. To validate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we conduct numerical experiments on various problem instances, including the $\ell_1$ regularized logistic regression, quadratic programming, and compressive sensing. The experimental results indicate that our algorithms outperform existing methods in terms of efficiency. This also demonstrates the potential of the stochastic algorithmic versions of these algorithms in application areas such as statistics, machine learning, and data mining. Finally, it is worth noting that this paper aims to introduce how Güler's acceleration technique can be applied to gradient-based algorithms and to provide a unified and concise framework for their construction.

TL;DR: 本文研究了实值平均场倒向随机微分方程(BSDEs)，在生成器满足分离二次增长假设和边界终端条件下，证明了在S^∞ × H^2_BMO空间中解的存在唯一性。方法结合了Malliavin微积分与BMO估计，并通过逼近技术处理二次情形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补Cheridito和Nam(2017)与Hao等人(2025)在二次BSDE结果之间的空白，扩展平均场BSDE理论到更一般的二次增长情形。

Method: 采用Malliavin微积分结合精细的BMO和稳定性估计，首先在Lipschitz设置中获得Z的一致S^∞界，然后通过逼近技术处理二次情形。

Result: 在分离二次增长假设和边界终端条件下，证明了平均场BSDE在S^∞ × H^2_BMO空间中解的存在唯一性；在完全耦合二次情形下，在终端变量满足小性条件下也建立了存在唯一性。

Conclusion: 成功建立了平均场二次BSDE的理论框架，并将结果应用于解决带有集体负债的平均场指数效用最大化问题，推广了Hu等人(2005)的经典效用最大化框架。

Abstract: We study real-valued mean-field backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) of the form \[ Y_t = ξ+ \int_t^T \widetilde{\mathbb E}\, g(s, Z_s, \tilde Z_s)\, ds - \int_t^T Z_s \, dW_s, \] where $\tilde Z$ denotes an independent copy of $Z$ and $\widetilde{\mathbb E}$ the expectation with respect to $\tilde Z$. Under a \emph{separately quadratic} growth assumption (H\textsubscript{q}) on the generator $g$ in $(Z,\tilde Z)$, together with a bounded terminal condition, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions in $\mathbb S^\infty \times \mathbb H^2_{\mathrm{BMO}}$. Our approach departs from classical fixed-point arguments and instead combines Malliavin calculus with refined BMO and stability estimates: we first obtain uniform $\mathbb S^\infty$-bounds for $Z$ in a Lipschitz setting with bounded Malliavin derivative, and then pass to the quadratic case by approximation, using a stability result in $\mathbb S^2\times\mathbb H^2$. This closes the gap between the quadratic BSDE results of Cheridito and Nam (2017) and Hao et al. (2025).
  In the second part of the paper, we extend the framework to generators of the form $g(t,z,\tilde z,\bar z)$ satisfying a \emph{fully coupled quadratic} condition (H\textsubscript{q}$'$). In this general regime we establish existence and uniqueness under a smallness condition on the centered terminal variable. As an application, we solve a mean-field exponential utility maximization problem with a collective liability, thereby generalizing the classical utility maximization framework of Hu et al. (2005) to a fully coupled quadratic mean-field setting.

Motivation: 传统Lyapunov和Riccati方程的分析方法较为复杂，本文旨在利用正系统理论提供新的分析视角和简化证明。

Method: 构造与Lyapunov和Riccati方程相关的正系统：对于Lyapunov方程构造严格正线性系统，对于代数Riccati方程构造齐次严格正系统。

Result: 在标准可观测性假设下，Lyapunov方程对应的正系统在Hilbert度量下指数收敛到Perron-Frobenius向量；Riccati方程对应的系统只能获得渐近收敛。

Conclusion: 正系统理论为Lyapunov和Riccati方程提供了统一的分析框架，能够简化解的存在唯一性证明，但两种方程的收敛性质有所不同。

Abstract: This paper presents a new interpretation of the Lyapunov and Riccati equations from the perspective of positive system theory. We show it is possible to construct positive systems related to these equations, and then certain conclusions -- such as the existence and uniqueness of solutions -- can be drawn from positive systems theory. Specifically, under standard observability assumptions, a strictly positive linear system can be constructed for Lyapunov equations, leading to exponential convergence in Hilbert metric to the Perron-Frobenius vector -- closely related to the solution of the Lyapunov equation. For algebraic Riccati equations, homogeneous strictly positive systems can be constructed, which exhibit more complex dynamical behaviors. While the existence and uniqueness of the solution can still be proven, only asymptotic convergence can be obtained.

Abstract: We study linear policy approximations for the risk-conscious operation of an industrial energy system with uncertain wind power, significant and variable electricity demand, and high thermal output, as found in a modern foundry. The system incorporates thermal storage and operates under rolling forecasts, leading to a sequential decision-making framework. To address uncertainty in key parameters, we formulate chance-constrained optimization problems that limit the probability of critical constraint violations, such as unmet demand requirements or the exceedance of system boundaries. To reduce computational effort, we replace direct uncertainty handling with a parameter-modified cost function that approximates the underlying risk structure. We validate our method through a numerical case study, demonstrating the trade-offs between operational efficiency and reliability in a stochastic environment.

Conclusion: 本文填补了CGM收敛性分析中的空白，在更合理的假设下提供了严格的收敛保证，证明了CGM在解决强凸优化和强单调变分不等式问题中的有效性。

Abstract: The constrained gradient method (CGM) has recently been proposed to solve convex optimization and monotone variational inequality (VI) problems with general functional constraints. While existing literature has established convergence results for CGM, the assumptions employed therein are quite restrictive; in some cases, certain assumptions are mutually inconsistent, leading to gaps in the underlying analysis. This paper aims to derive rigorous and improved convergence guarantees for CGM under weaker and more reasonable assumptions, specifically in the context of strongly convex optimization and strongly monotone VI problems. Preliminary numerical experiments are provided to verify the validity of CGM and demonstrate its efficacy in addressing such problems.

Abstract: While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.

### [115] [Cognitive BASIC: An In-Model Interpreted Reasoning Language for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16837)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cognitive BASIC是一种基于BASIC风格的提示语言和模型内解释器，它将大语言模型推理结构化，形成明确的逐步执行轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受复古BASIC简单性的启发，重新利用编号行和简单命令作为可解释的认知控制层，使现代LLM能够可靠地模拟这类短程序，实现模型内部透明的多步推理。

Method: 使用自然语言解释器文件指定命令语义、内存更新和日志行为，通过心智模型解释器提取声明性和程序性知识，检测矛盾并在必要时产生解决方案。

Result: 在三个LLM上的知识提取、冲突检测和推理任务基准测试中，所有模型都能执行Cognitive BASIC程序，总体表现强劲但性能不均。

Conclusion: Cognitive BASIC为LLM推理提供了一种结构化的、可解释的方法，能够有效支持多步推理和知识管理任务。

Abstract: Cognitive BASIC is a minimal, BASIC-style prompting language and in-model interpreter that structures large language model (LLM) reasoning into explicit, stepwise execution traces. Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.

Abstract: Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.

*Hao Chen,Renzheng Zhang,Scott S. Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出DAPS++方法，将扩散模型在逆问题求解中的角色重新解释为EM框架中的初始化阶段，使似然项更直接地指导推理过程，显著提高了计算效率和重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯视角下基于分数的扩散方法在解决逆问题时，先验提供的指导有限，重建主要受测量一致性项驱动，导致推理过程与扩散动力学脱节。需要重新理解扩散在逆问题求解中的结构。

Method: 将扩散重新解释为EM框架中的初始化阶段，引入DAPS++方法，使扩散阶段和数据驱动细化完全解耦，允许似然项更直接地指导推理，同时保持数值稳定性。

Result: DAPS++需要更少的函数评估次数和测量优化步骤，在多种图像恢复任务中实现了高计算效率和鲁棒的重建性能。

Conclusion: 统一扩散轨迹在实践中保持有效的原因在于DAPS++框架提供了新的理论解释，通过解耦扩散和细化阶段实现了更高效的逆问题求解。

Abstract: From a Bayesian perspective, score-based diffusion solves inverse problems through joint inference, embedding the likelihood with the prior to guide the sampling process. However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice. By requiring fewer function evaluations (NFEs) and measurement-optimization steps, \textbf{DAPS++} achieves high computational efficiency and robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合差分奖励机制来解决多车辆协同驾驶中传统状态奖励函数因奖励差异消失而导致策略梯度信噪比低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多车辆协同驾驶的高频连续控制任务中，传统基于状态的奖励函数存在奖励差异消失的问题，导致策略梯度的信噪比低，严重影响算法收敛和性能提升。

Method: 提出了混合差分奖励机制，包含两个互补组件：基于全局势函数的时序差分奖励，利用势能演化趋势确保最优策略不变性和长期目标一致性；以及动作梯度奖励，直接测量动作的边际效用以提供高信噪比的局部指导信号。

Result: 通过在线规划（MCTS）和多智能体强化学习算法（QMIX、MAPPO、MADDPG）的广泛实验表明，HDR机制显著提高了收敛速度和策略稳定性。

Conclusion: HDR能够引导智能体学习高质量的合作策略，有效平衡交通效率和安全性。

Abstract: In multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks involving high-frequency continuous control, traditional state-based reward functions suffer from the issue of vanishing reward differences. This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.

Method: 设计了语言和视觉扩展来增强标准贝叶斯网络用户界面，通过用户研究比较了语言扩展、视觉扩展、组合扩展和基线界面的效果。

Result: 用户在使用所有三种扩展界面时，在观察影响、影响路径以及观察间相互影响等问题上的表现均优于基线界面；对于某些问题类型，语言和视觉结合的效果优于单独使用任一模式。

Conclusion: 语言和视觉扩展能有效提升用户对贝叶斯网络推理的理解，多模态结合的方式在某些方面具有优势。

Abstract: Bayesian Networks (BNs) are an important tool for assisting probabilistic reasoning, but despite being considered transparent models, people have trouble understanding them. Further, current User Interfaces (UIs) still do not clarify the reasoning of BNs. To address this problem, we have designed verbal and visual extensions to the standard BN UI, which can guide users through common inference patterns.
  We conducted a user study to compare our verbal, visual and combined UI extensions, and a baseline UI. Our main findings are: (1) users did better with all three types of extensions than with the baseline UI for questions about the impact of an observation, the paths that enable this impact, and the way in which an observation influences the impact of other observations; and (2) using verbal and visual modalities together is better than using either modality alone for some of these question types.

Abstract: The emergence of AI Scientists has demonstrated remarkable potential in automating scientific research. However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: 预算意识对工具增强型智能体的有效扩展至关重要，提出的方法在预算约束下显著提升了智能体性能，为智能体扩展提供了系统性的实证见解。

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only "thinking" in tokens but also "acting" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack "budget awareness" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to "dig deeper" on a promising lead or "pivot" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) form an invaluable resource for training clinical decision support systems. To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge.

Abstract: The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model is a cornerstone for representing rational agency in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences. Yet, its integration into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations remains limited. This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology, conceived as a modular Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) that captures the cognitive architecture of agents through beliefs, desires, intentions, and their dynamic interrelations. The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states. Together, these experiments illustrate how the BDI Ontology acts as both a conceptual and operational bridge between declarative and procedural intelligence, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems operating within the Web of Data.

Abstract: Episodic rewards present a significant challenge in reinforcement learning. While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards. Our evalu-ation compares the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches in the MiniGrid-MA setting, with experimental results demonstrating superior perfor-mance.

Conclusion: 将智能体架构与领域内在任务结构对齐是构建稳健可靠专业自主系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI seeks to endow systems with sustained autonomy, reasoning, and interaction capabilities. To realize this vision, its assumptions about agency must be complemented by explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance. This paper argues that the conceptual tools developed within the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community, such as BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modelling, provide precisely such a foundation. By aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination, we outline a path toward agentic systems that are not only capable and flexible, but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable. The result is a perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy.

Motivation: 由于许多LLM行为的自然示例稀少，研究者不得不依赖合成或偏离策略的LLM响应来训练探测器，需要系统评估这些数据对探测器泛化能力的影响

Method: 在八种不同LLM行为上测试线性和注意力探测器，使用合成和偏离策略数据训练，评估在模型被激励产生目标行为的测试集上的泛化性能

Conclusion: 在缺乏策略内数据时，使用相同领域的偏离策略数据比使用不同领域的策略内数据产生更可靠的探测器，强调需要能更好处理LLM监控中分布偏移的方法

Abstract: Probing has emerged as a promising method for monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling inference-time detection of concerning behaviours such as deception and sycophancy. However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle sensing by enabling information sharing among connected vehicles (CVs). However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.

### [130] [Law-Strength Frontiers and a No-Free-Lunch Result for Law-Seeking Reinforcement Learning on Volatility Law Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17304)
*Jian'an Zhang*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: 本文研究了在波动率曲面上应用强化学习时，将无套利公理作为软惩罚项对高容量RL代理的影响，发现这种方法主要产生Goodhart式激励来利用模型误差，而非可靠地对齐法律约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨科学AI视角下，在波动率曲面上进行强化学习时，通过无套利法律约束作为惩罚项是否能可靠对齐高容量RL代理，还是主要产生利用模型误差的Goodhart式激励。

Method: 从经典静态无套利条件构建有限维凸波动率法律流形，定义法律惩罚函数和优雅失败指数(GFI)，使用合成生成器产生法律一致轨迹，训练无法律正则化的循环神经网络世界模型，并定义Goodhart分解来分析幽灵套利。

Result: 在SPX/VIX类世界模型实验中，简单结构策略形成了经验法律强度前沿，而所有寻求法律的RL变体都表现不佳，进入高惩罚、高GFI区域。证明了幽灵套利激励定理、法律强度权衡定理和无免费午餐定理。

Conclusion: 波动率提供了一个具体案例，表明使用可验证惩罚的奖励塑造不足以实现稳健的法律对齐，无约束的法律寻求RL无法在P&L、惩罚和GFI方面帕累托优于结构基线。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) on volatility surfaces through the lens of Scientific AI. We ask whether axiomatic no-arbitrage laws, imposed as soft penalties on a learned world model, can reliably align high-capacity RL agents, or mainly create Goodhart-style incentives to exploit model errors. From classical static no-arbitrage conditions we build a finite-dimensional convex volatility law manifold of admissible total-variance surfaces, together with a metric law-penalty functional and a Graceful Failure Index (GFI) that normalizes law degradation under shocks. A synthetic generator produces law-consistent trajectories, while a recurrent neural world model trained without law regularization exhibits structured off-manifold errors. On this testbed we define a Goodhart decomposition \(r = r^{\mathcal{M}} + r^\perp\), where \(r^\perp\) is ghost arbitrage from off-manifold prediction error. We prove a ghost-arbitrage incentive theorem for PPO-type agents, a law-strength trade-off theorem showing that stronger penalties eventually worsen P\&L, and a no-free-lunch theorem: under a law-consistent world model and law-aligned strategy class, unconstrained law-seeking RL cannot Pareto-dominate structural baselines on P\&L, penalties, and GFI. In experiments on an SPX/VIX-like world model, simple structural strategies form the empirical law-strength frontier, while all law-seeking RL variants underperform and move into high-penalty, high-GFI regions. Volatility thus provides a concrete case where reward shaping with verifiable penalties is insufficient for robust law alignment.

Motivation: 解决混合物理系统中已知物理模型与数据驱动建模的结合问题，特别是在非理想区域提高预测精度并保持物理一致性。

Method: 使用分层高斯过程先验对隐函数建模，推导基于熵的获取函数来指导数据采集，通过闭式微分熵表达式和可处理下界实现高效评估。

Result: 在汽液平衡系统建模中，熵引导采样提高了采样效率，加速了代理模型收敛，在非理想区域增强了预测准确性并保持了物理一致性。

Conclusion: BITS for GAPS为复杂物理系统的混合建模提供了一个高效、可解释且具有不确定性感知的框架。

Abstract: We introduce the Bayesian Information-Theoretic Sampling for hierarchical GAussian Process Surrogates (BITS for GAPS) framework to emulate latent components in hybrid physical systems. BITS for GAPS supports serial hybrid modeling, where known physics governs part of the system and residual dynamics are represented as a latent function inferred from data. A Gaussian process prior is placed over the latent function, with hierarchical priors on its hyperparameters to encode physically meaningful structure in the predictive posterior.
  To guide data acquisition, we derive entropy-based acquisition functions that quantify expected information gain from candidate input locations, identifying samples most informative for training the surrogate. Specifically, we obtain a closed-form expression for the differential entropy of the predictive posterior and establish a tractable lower bound for efficient evaluation. These derivations approximate the predictive posterior as a finite, uniformly weighted mixture of Gaussian processes.
  We demonstrate the framework's utility by modeling activity coefficients in vapor-liquid equilibrium systems, embedding the surrogate into extended Raoult's law for distillation design. Numerical results show that entropy-guided sampling improves sample efficiency by targeting regions of high uncertainty and potential information gain. This accelerates surrogate convergence, enhances predictive accuracy in non-ideal regimes, and preserves physical consistency. Overall, BITS for GAPS provides an efficient, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware framework for hybrid modeling of complex physical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决一类特殊的假设检验问题，其中零假设有多个分布而备择假设只有一个分布，需要找到最小有利分布和最优检验方法。

Method: 使用随机镜像下降算法进行凸优化，通过有限次迭代获得近似最小有利分布和接近最优的检验。

Result: 算法能在有限次迭代后获得理论保证的近似解，并提供了具体的实现建议，包括初始条件、步长和迭代次数。

Conclusion: 该方法可视为Elliott等人算法的改进版本，并提供了理论性能保证，而原算法的理论性能是未知的。

Abstract: We consider a class of hypothesis testing problems where the null hypothesis postulates $M$ distributions for the observed data, and there is only one possible distribution under the alternative. We show that one can use a stochastic mirror descent routine for convex optimization to provably obtain - after finitely many iterations - both an approximate least-favorable distribution and a nearly optimal test, in a sense we make precise. Our theoretical results yield concrete recommendations about the algorithm's implementation, including its initial condition, its step size, and the number of iterations. Importantly, our suggested algorithm can be viewed as a slight variation of the algorithm suggested by Elliott, Müller, and Watson (2015), whose theoretical performance guarantees are unknown.

TL;DR: 对433名社会学学者的调查显示，约三分之一每周使用生成式AI，主要用于写作辅助，而非研究规划或数据分析。学者们普遍担忧AI的社会和环境后果，对其输出信任度低，但对AI未来发展持乐观态度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生成式AI既受关注又引发担忧的背景下，了解学者们实际如何使用该技术、使用原因以及他们对技术的态度至关重要。

Method: 对过去5年在50种社会学期刊发表文章的433名作者进行问卷调查，分析他们使用生成式AI的频率、用途、原因和态度。

Result: 约33%的受访者每周至少使用一次生成式AI，主要用于写作辅助；计算与非计算研究者在使用和态度上差异不大；学者们普遍担忧AI的社会和环境影响，对AI输出信任度低。

Conclusion: 尽管学者们对生成式AI的未来发展持乐观态度，但对其当前的社会环境影响深感担忧，且对其输出信任度不高，对AI是否会对社会学领域产生积极影响存在分歧。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered considerable attention for its potential utility in research and scholarship, even among those who typically do not rely on computational tools. Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use. While optimism that GenAI will improve is high, scholars are divided on whether GenAI will have a positive impact on the field.

Method: 构建结构化知识系统（基于引文网络和概念关联）、协作研究协议OSP（支持多智能体和人类研究者协作）、开放评估平台ScienceArena（基于盲对用户投票和Elo排名）。

Conclusion: OmniScientist通过编码人类科研机制，使AI智能体能够理解利用人类知识系统，实现协作共进，为建立真正的科研生态系统提供了基础设施支持。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents have demonstrated increasing proficiency in scientific tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experimental design to manuscript writing. Such agent systems are commonly referred to as "AI Scientists." However, existing AI Scientists predominantly formulate scientific discovery as a standalone search or optimization problem, overlooking the fact that scientific research is inherently a social and collaborative endeavor. Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed of collaborative mechanisms, contribution attribution, peer review, and structured scientific knowledge networks. Due to the lack of modeling for these critical dimensions, current systems struggle to establish a genuine research ecosystem or interact deeply with the human scientific community. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniScientist, a framework that explicitly encodes the underlying mechanisms of human research into the AI scientific workflow. OmniScientist not only achieves end-to-end automation across data foundation, literature review, research ideation, experiment automation, scientific writing, and peer review, but also provides comprehensive infrastructural support by simulating the human scientific system, comprising: (1) a structured knowledge system built upon citation networks and conceptual correlations; (2) a collaborative research protocol (OSP), which enables seamless multi-agent collaboration and human researcher participation; and (3) an open evaluation platform (ScienceArena) based on blind pairwise user voting and Elo rankings. This infrastructure empowers agents to not only comprehend and leverage human knowledge systems but also to collaborate and co-evolve, fostering a sustainable and scalable innovation ecosystem.

Motivation: 量化人类临床决策中的性别差异，特别是在急诊分诊等关键医疗场景中，以识别和解决现实决策中的不平等问题。

Method: 训练LLM模拟观察到的决策，然后评估仅性别翻转的反事实对，在保持所有其他临床因素不变的情况下估计方向性差异。

Result: 在波尔多大学医院的15万例入院数据中，相同临床表现的女性比男性获得较低严重程度分诊评分的可能性高约2.1%；在法国全国范围内相当于每年超过20万例。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可扩展的工具，可用于检测和解决现实世界决策中的不平等问题，不仅适用于医疗领域，还可扩展到招聘、学术和司法等其他决策场景。

Abstract: We present a novel, domain-agnostic counterfactual approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify gender disparities in human clinical decision-making. The method trains an LLM to emulate observed decisions, then evaluates counterfactual pairs in which only gender is flipped, estimating directional disparities while holding all other clinical factors constant. We study emergency triage, validating the approach on more than 150,000 admissions to the Bordeaux University Hospital (France) and replicating results on a subset of MIMIC-IV across a different language, population, and healthcare system. In the Bordeaux cohort, otherwise identical presentations were approximately 2.1% more likely to receive a lower-severity triage score when presented as female rather than male; scaled to national emergency volumes in France, this corresponds to more than 200,000 lower-severity assignments per year. Modality-specific analyses indicate that both explicit tabular gender indicators and implicit textual gender cues contribute to the disparity. Beyond emergency care, the approach supports bias audits in other settings (e.g., hiring, academic, and justice decisions), providing a scalable tool to detect and address inequities in real-world decision-making.

Abstract: Generative AI is spreading rapidly, creating significant social and economic value while also raising concerns about its high energy use and environmental sustainability. While prior studies have predominantly focused on the energy-intensive nature of the training phase, the cumulative environmental footprint generated during large-scale service operations, particularly in the inference phase, has received comparatively less attention. To bridge this gap this study conducts a scoping review of methodologies and research trends in AI carbon footprint assessment. We analyze the classification and standardization status of existing AI carbon measurement tools and methodologies, and comparatively examine the environmental impacts arising from both training and inference stages. In addition, we identify how multidimensional factors such as model size, prompt complexity, serving environments, and system boundary definitions shape the resulting carbon footprint. Our review reveals critical limitations in current AI carbon accounting practices, including methodological inconsistencies, technology-specific biases, and insufficient attention to end-to-end system perspectives. Building on these insights, we propose future research and governance directions: (1) establishing standardized and transparent universal measurement protocols, (2) designing dynamic evaluation frameworks that incorporate user behavior, (3) developing life-cycle monitoring systems that encompass embodied emissions, and (4) advancing multidimensional sustainability assessment framework that balance model performance with environmental efficiency. This paper provides a foundation for interdisciplinary dialogue aimed at building a sustainable AI ecosystem and offers a baseline guideline for researchers seeking to understand the environmental implications of AI across technical, social, and operational dimensions.

TL;DR: 本文通过基于代理的模型分析不同学业进展制度对工程专业学生辍学率、毕业时间、公平性和心理体验的影响，比较了三种政策情景：传统考试制度、直接晋升制度和带安全网的直接晋升制度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学业进展规则通常被视为行政细节，但实际上它们从根本上决定了谁能留在高等教育中以及以什么条件留下。本文旨在研究不同进展制度如何重新配置辍学率、毕业时间、公平性和学生心理体验。

Method: 使用经验校准的基于代理模型，基于1343名学生的纵向数据集和Kaplan-Meier生存分析，模拟三种政策情景：传统考试制度、直接晋升制度和带安全网的直接晋升制度。

Result: 直接晋升制度创造了'晋升墙'：辍学率在前两年急剧上升，整体辍学率增加，低韧性与高韧性学生之间的公平差距扩大。带安全网的方案部分拆除了这堵墙，减少了辍学率和公平差距，并产生最低的最终压力水平。

Conclusion: 学业进展规则是评估政策的核心对象而非中性背景。改进效率的主张必须与包容性、公平性和学生心理健康共同评估，基于模拟的决策支持可以帮助机构在实施前预演评估改革。

Abstract: Progression and assessment rules are often treated as administrative details, yet they fundamentally shape who is allowed to remain in higher education, and on what terms. This article uses a calibrated agent-based model to examine how alternative progression regimes reconfigure dropout, time-to-degree, equity and students' psychological experience in a long, tightly sequenced engineering programme. Building on a leakage-aware longitudinal dataset of 1,343 students and a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of time-to-dropout, we simulate three policy scenarios: (A) a historical "regularity + finals" regime, where students accumulate exam debt; (B) a direct-promotion regime that removes regularity and finals but requires full course completion each term; and (C) a direct-promotion regime complemented by a capacity-limited remedial "safety net" for marginal failures in bottleneck courses. The model is empirically calibrated to reproduce the observed dropout curve under Scenario A and then used to explore counterfactuals. Results show that direct promotion creates a "promotion wall": attrition becomes sharply front-loaded in the first two years, overall dropout rises, and equity gaps between low- and high-resilience students widen, even as exam debt disappears. The safety-net scenario partially dismantles this wall: it reduces dropout and equity gaps relative to pure direct promotion and yields the lowest final stress levels, at the cost of additional, targeted teaching capacity. These findings position progression rules as central objects of assessment policy rather than neutral background. The article argues that claims of improved efficiency are incomplete unless they are evaluated jointly with inclusion, equity and students' psychological wellbeing, and it illustrates how simulation-based decision support can help institutions rehearse assessment reforms before implementing them.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在全球高风险决策中的影响力日益增强，确保其与多样文化价值观的对齐已成为关键的治理挑战。

Method: 采用四种集成方法：伦理困境语料库评估时间稳定性、多样性增强框架量化文化保真度、首词概率对齐分析分布准确性、多阶段推理框架实现可解释决策。

Result: 分析20多个领先模型发现：价值系统存在根本性不稳定、年轻群体系统性代表不足、模型规模与对齐质量呈非线性关系；Mistral系列在跨文化对齐方面显著优于LLaMA3系列；全参数微调在保留文化变异方面优于人类反馈强化学习。

Conclusion: 中西方模型都未能实现稳健的跨文化泛化能力，中国模型更注重多语言数据集成进行情境优化，而西方模型则更多进行架构实验但仍存在美国中心偏见。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly influence high-stakes decision-making across global contexts, ensuring their alignment with diverse cultural values has become a critical governance challenge. This study presents a Multi-Layered Auditing Platform for Responsible AI that systematically evaluates cross-cultural value alignment in China-origin and Western-origin LLMs through four integrated methodologies: Ethical Dilemma Corpus for assessing temporal stability, Diversity-Enhanced Framework (DEF) for quantifying cultural fidelity, First-Token Probability Alignment for distributional accuracy, and Multi-stAge Reasoning frameworK (MARK) for interpretable decision-making. Our comparative analysis of 20+ leading models, such as Qwen, GPT-4o, Claude, LLaMA, and DeepSeek, reveals universal challenges-fundamental instability in value systems, systematic under-representation of younger demographics, and non-linear relationships between model scale and alignment quality-alongside divergent regional development trajectories. While China-origin models increasingly emphasize multilingual data integration for context-specific optimization, Western models demonstrate greater architectural experimentation but persistent U.S.-centric biases. Neither paradigm achieves robust cross-cultural generalization. We establish that Mistral-series architectures significantly outperform LLaMA3-series in cross-cultural alignment, and that Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning on diverse datasets surpasses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback in preserving cultural variation...

Motivation: 当前国际和国家层面的AI治理发展、应用和执行不均衡，传统治理方式无法确保AI的负责任发展，需要关注AI开发环节的自下而上干预。

Method: 采用参与式设计方法，将AI工作者作为知识、相对权力和意向性的来源，促进算法集体行动。

Conclusion: 仅靠治理无法确保AI的负责任发展，应更多关注AI开发环节的自下而上干预，将AI工作者视为地缘政治行为体和变革推动者。

Abstract: According to the theory of International Political Economy (IPE), states are often incentivized to rely on rather than constrain powerful corporations. For this reason, IPE provides a useful lens to explain why efforts to govern Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the international and national levels have thus far been developed, applied, and enforced unevenly. Building on recent work that explores how AI companies engage in geopolitics, this position paper argues that some AI workers can be considered actors of geopolitics. It makes the timely case that governance alone cannot ensure responsible, ethical, or robust AI development and use, and greater attention should be paid to bottom-up interventions at the site of AI development. AI workers themselves should be situated as individual agents of change, especially when considering their potential to foster Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA). Drawing on methods of Participatory Design (PD), this paper proposes engaging AI workers as sources of knowledge, relative power, and intentionality to encourage more responsible and just AI development and create the conditions that can facilitate ACA.

Abstract: A hemispherical multilayer wide-band (7-13 GHz) band-pass frequency selective surface (FSS) is reported. A new design technique based on a Goldberg discretization and unit cell scaling technique is introduced to accommodate the curved profile of the FSS. The FSS is additively manufactured by sequentially printing dielectric layers and metallic patterns until 3 patterned silver-ink surfaces are integrated within a 4.5 mm (${λ_0}/6$ at 10 GHz) thick ABS hemispherical radome. The diameter and the height of the realized hemispherical FSS are around $5{λ_0}$ and $3{λ_0}$ respectively. Measurements demonstrate a roughly 1.7 dB insertion loss in the passband and 15-20 dB rejection in the stop-band. Additionally, a new postprocessing technique is used to suppress the effects of edge diffraction in the measured transmission spectrum. The design process, manufacturing technique, and measurement postprocessing represent novel advancements enabling future conformal frequency selective surfaces.

Abstract: Performance ratio (PR) is a established measure of efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems. While previous research demonstrated the effects of meteorological and technical variables on PR, a gap persists in the literature on which variables strongly influence PR in large-scale, real-world, heterogeneous PV systems. This paper aims to fill this gap, applying data-driven models to PV systems located in Rondônia State, Brazil, to identify which variables strongly influence annual PR, and, hence, should be the target for optimization. Surprisingly, only negligible effects were found between meteorological and technical variables on annual PR, indicating that human-factors (such as installation, monitoring, and maintenance quality) might have a stronger effect. These findings indicates that, to improve performance of PV systems, policy makers could focus on creating educational programs to teach PV installers and technicians how to properly install, monitor, and maintain modern PV systems. Through estimating the probability density functions of PR, its peak value was found as 78.85% (mean 77.52%, 95% confidence interval of 76.12% to 78.84%, and 95% prediction interval of 58.83% to 92.70%). A map of annual final yield was developed for Rondônia State and can be used by entrepreneurs to quickly and cheaply estimate energy production.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合扩散模型、Lyapunov稳定性和LLM的AUV控制框架，解决了传统RL方法在样本效率、长期规划和稳定性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUV控制面临非线性水动力学、时变扰动和定位不确定性等挑战，传统控制器适应性有限，而RL方法存在样本效率低、长期规划能力弱和缺乏稳定性保证的问题。

Method: 采用扩散先验Lyapunov actor-critic框架：扩散模型生成平滑多模态的候选动作，Lyapunov批评器施加稳定性约束，LLM驱动的外环根据任务语义和训练反馈自适应选择和优化Lyapunov函数。

Result: 在复杂海洋动力学下的广泛仿真表明，该框架相比传统RL和扩散增强基线，实现了更精确的轨迹跟踪、更高的任务完成率、更好的能量效率、更快的收敛速度和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的'生成-过滤-优化'机制有效提升了样本效率和规划能力，并将稳定性保证与多目标优化任务中的多样化任务需求对齐。

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are indispensable for marine exploration; yet, their control is hindered by nonlinear hydrodynamics, time-varying disturbances, and localization uncertainty. Traditional controllers provide only limited adaptability, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), though promising, suffers from sample inefficiency, weak long-term planning, and lacks stability guarantees, leading to unreliable behavior. To address these challenges, we propose a diffusion-prior Lyapunov actor-critic framework that unifies exploration, stability, and semantic adaptability. Specifically, a diffusion model generates smooth, multimodal, and disturbance-resilient candidate actions; a Lyapunov critic further imposes dual constraints that ensure stability; and a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven outer loop adaptively selects and refines Lyapunov functions based on task semantics and training feedback. This "generation-filtering-optimization" mechanism not only enhances sample efficiency and planning capability but also aligns stability guarantees with diverse mission requirements in the multi-objective optimization task. Extensive simulations under complex ocean dynamics demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves more accurate trajectory tracking, higher task completion rates, improved energy efficiency, faster convergence, and improved robustness compared with conventional RL and diffusion-augmented baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低频振荡是含高可再生能源渗透、长线路和大负荷的电网主要挑战，现有基于HVDC或储能的阻尼策略受限于固定控制架构，部分模态阻尼效果不佳。

Method: 引入状态导数反馈（SDF）阻尼控制器，同时使用频率及其变化率作为反馈信号，结合HVDC和储能系统增强电网稳定性。

Result: 在两区域和三区域系统测试中，SDF控制器能复现状态反馈性能，在区域间和区域内振荡阻尼方面均优于基于频率差的方法。

Conclusion: SDF控制是稳定电力电子丰富电网的实用解决方案，具有良好的振荡阻尼效果。

Abstract: Low-frequency oscillations remain a major challenge in bulk power systems with high renewable penetration, long lines, and large loads. Existing damping strategies based on power modulation of high voltage DC (HVDC) or energy storage, are often limited by fixed control architectures, leaving some modes poorly damped. This paper introduces a state-derivative feedback (SDF) damping controller that uses both frequency and its rate of change as feedback signals. Incorporating state derivatives enhances modal damping and accelerates frequency recovery, enabling HVDC and energy storage to effectively stabilize the grid. We evaluate the SDF controller on two- and three-area systems and compare performance with a frequency difference-based damping scheme. Results show that the SDF control reproduces state-feedback performance while providing good damping of both inter- and intra-area oscillations compared to the frequency-difference method, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for stabilizing power-electronics-rich grids.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义通信在基于包的通信协议下特别容易受到包丢失的影响，因为高维语义特征必须分割为一维传输单元。关键问题是如何分割语义特征以最大化鲁棒性。

Method: 系统研究了Transformer和CNN两种主流架构在不同特征分割方案下的性能。为增强CNN的鲁棒性，提出了语义均衡机制(SEM)，包括动态缩放模块和广播模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，配备SEM的CNN在包丢失下实现了优雅的性能下降(在40%包丢失时保留约85%的无损失PSNR)，性能与Transformer模型相当。

Conclusion: 在适当的分割策略下，保持平衡的语义表示是实现对包丢失固有鲁棒性的基本条件，这些见解可扩展到其他模态如视频，并支持实际的语义通信设计。

Abstract: Semantic communication can improve transmission efficiency by focusing on task-relevant information. However, under packet-based communication protocols, any error typically results in the loss of an entire packet, making semantic communication particularly vulnerable to packet loss. Since high-dimensional semantic features must be partitioned into one-dimensional transmission units during packetization. A critical open question is how to partition semantic features to maximize robustness. To address this, we systematically investigate the performance of two mainstream architectures, Transformer and Convolutional neural networks (CNN), under various feature partitioning schemes. The results show that the Transformer architecture exhibits inherent robustness to packet loss when partitioned along the channel dimension. In contrast, the CNN-based baseline exhibits imbalanced channel utilization, causing severe degradation once dominant channels are lost. To enhance the CNN resilience, we propose a lightweight Semantic Equalization Mechanism (SEM) that balances channel contributions and prevents a few channels from dominating. SEM consists of two parallel approaches: a Dynamic Scale module that adaptively adjusts channel importance, and a Broadcast module that facilitates information interaction among channels. Experimental results demonstrate that CNN equipped with SEM achieve graceful degradation under packet loss (retaining about 85% of lossless PSNR at 40% packet loss), comparable to that of Transformer models. Our findings indicate that, under an appropriate partitioning strategy, maintaining a balanced semantic representation is a fundamental condition for achieving intrinsic robustness against packet loss. These insights may also extend to other modalities such as video and support practical semantic communication design.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的自适应协调层(ACL)和重新定义的自适应与学习层(AL)架构，用于实现网络物理系统系统(CPSoS)的动态弹性管理。ACL负责实时风险检测和协调应对措施，AL负责战略层面的学习和长期调整，两者结合实现了短期响应与长期学习的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的弹性架构通常只隐含处理适应性问题，主要保持静态特性，无法满足CPSoS在复杂动态环境中的持续适应需求。需要一种能够将弹性理解为持续、数据驱动过程的架构模型。

Method: 引入自适应协调层(ACL)作为操作控制层，负责实时风险检测、优先级排序和动态协调；重新定义自适应与学习层(AL)作为战略合作层，评估ACL的操作决策并从中学习，在策略、治理和架构层面进行长期调整。提供了从基于规则、KPI驱动到AI支持和元学习机制等多种实现方案。

Result: 提出了一个将弹性从静态系统属性转变为持续、数据驱动的协调和系统学习过程的架构模型。该模型能够根据系统复杂性、数据可用性和监管程度灵活组合不同的实现方案。

Conclusion: 该架构为下一代自适应和弹性的CPSoS奠定了方法论基础，实现了短期响应能力与长期学习发展能力的结合，使弹性成为系统持续进化的动态过程。

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems of systems (CPSoS) are highly complex, dynamic environments in which technical, cybernetic and organisational subsystems interact closely with one another. Dynamic, continuously adaptable resilience is required to ensure their functionality under variable conditions. However, existing resilience architectures usually only deal with adaptation implicitly and thus remain predominantly static. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a new Adaptive Coordination Layer (ACL) and conceptually redefining the Adaptation & Learning Layer (AL). The ACL acts as an operational control layer that detects risks in real time, prioritises countermeasures and coordinates them dynamically. The AL is reinterpreted as a strategic-cooperative layer that evaluates the operational decisions of the ACL, learns from them, and derives long-term adjustments at the policy, governance, and architecture levels. Together, both layers operationalise the resilience principle of adaptation and combine short-term responsiveness with long-term learning and development capabilities. The paper describes various implementation variants of both levels - from rule-based and KPI-driven approaches to AI-supported and meta-learning mechanisms - and shows how these can be combined depending on system complexity, data availability and degree of regulation. The proposed architecture model no longer understands resilience as a static system property, but as a continuous, data-driven process of mutual coordination and systemic learning. This creates a methodological basis for the next generation of adaptive and resilient CPSoS.

Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of estimating robustly the external load torque in rotary actuator systems, when only the generated motor drive torque and angular displacement are the available input and output. We compare, theoretically and experimentally, two sufficiently established linear observation techniques (i) reduced-order Luenberger observer and (ii) disturbance observer, both using the same identified model of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)-based actuator. Our goal is to highlight several aspects related to the implementation, relative degree of the input-torque to estimated-load-torque transfer characteristics, observer open-loop transfer function, and the associated sensitivity (respectively stability margins) with respect to inherently uncertain system plants. Apart from the developed analysis, a detailed experimental case study is demonstrated where the load torque sensor provides reference measurements and allows for evaluation of both observers.

Abstract: As the world shifts towards utilizing natural resources for electricity generation, there is need to enhance forecasting systems to guarantee a stable electricity provision and to incorporate the generated power into the network systems. This work provides a machine learning environment for renewable energy forecasting that prevents the flaws which are usually experienced in the actual process; intermittency, nonlinearity and intricacy in nature which is difficult to grasp by ordinary existing forecasting procedures. Leveraging a comprehensive approximately 30-year dataset encompassing multiple renewable energy sources, our research evaluates two distinct approaches: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and Non-Linear Autoregressive distributed called with Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast total power generation using the solar, wind, and hydroelectric resources. The framework uses high temporal resolution and multiple parameters of the environment to improve the predictions. The fact that both the models in terms of error metrics were equally significant and had some unique tendencies at certain circumstances. The long history allows for better model calibration of temporal fluctuations and seasonal and climatic effects on power generation. The reliability enhancement in the prediction function, which benefits from 30 years of data, has value to grid operators, energy traders, and those establishing renewable energy policies and standards concerning reliability

Abstract: The large penetration of distributed generations impacts both the secondary low-voltage (LV) and the primary medium-voltage (MV) segments of the distribution network. Optimizing power flow calculations for the integrated MV/LV networks is crucial for the real-time management of modern distribution networks. Traditional methods in symmetrical coordinates are primarily limited to the three-wire model of three-phase networks, often leading to inaccuracies in power flow calculations when applied to three-phase four-wire LV segments. This paper introduces a novel power flow method for integrated three-wire MV and four-wire LV networks. Using eigenvector decomposition to diagonalize the admittance matrix of four-wire LV lines, the proposed method improves the computational efficiency of power flow calculations and accurately calculates the neutral-to-ground voltage. The results of the case studies show over 50\% reduction in the number of non-zero elements in the LU factors of the bus admittance matrix, and speed-up factors of 2.78 on the IEEE 123-node test system and 3.63 on the IEEE 8500-node test system in execution times for Volt/Var control (VVC), compared to the phase coordinates model.

Abstract: This paper introduces a Koopman-enhanced distributed switched model predictive control (SMPC) framework for safe and scalable navigation of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. The proposed method integrates switched motion modes and data-driven prediction to enable real-time, collision-free coordination. A localized Koopman operator approximates nonlinear obstacle dynamics as linear models based on online measurements, enabling accurate trajectory forecasting. These predictions are embedded into a distributed SMPC structure, where each UAV makes autonomous decisions using local and cluster-based information. This computationally efficient architecture is particularly promising for applications in surface transportation, including coordinated vehicle flows, shared infrastructure with pedestrians or cyclists, and urban UAV traffic. Simulation results demonstrate reliable formation control and real-time obstacle avoidance, highlighting the frameworks broad relevance for intelligent and cooperative mobility systems.

Abstract: The introduction of 5G New Radio networks with massive MIMO technology has complicated electromagnetic field exposure assessments for radiation protection. Massive MIMO transmission enables beamforming, beam steering, and spatial multiplexing across multiple transmission layers, with the number of simultaneous transmission paths depending on the rank of the radio channel, further named 'transmission rank'. Since the total transmission power of a base station is shared among these layers, rank variations affect the measured exposure levels, e.g., when assessments use provoked traffic via user equipment. This study investigates the impact of the transmission rank on the measured maximum exposure in the 3.6 GHz (n78) band of a German 5G network employing massive MIMO technology. Field measurements were performed using a spectrum analyzer with isotropic probe, to capture maximum field strengths under full-load traffic conditions. The transmission rank was manipulated by artificially degrading the reception quality of the user equipment with a shielding bag, forcing a single transmission layer (rank-1). The results were compared with unshielded operation allowing up to the maximum number of four independent transmission layers (rank-4). The data reveal exposure differences ranging from 1.7 dB to 5.4 dB, with a median of 4.3 dB at the measurement points studied. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the transmission rank in exposure assessments to electromagnetic fields.

Abstract: Deep Model Predictive Control (Deep MPC) is an evolving field that integrates model predictive control and deep learning. This manuscript is focused on a particular approach, which employs deep neural network in the loop with MPC. This class of approaches distributes control authority between a neural network and an MPC controller, in such a way that the neural network learns the model uncertainties while the MPC handles constraints. The approach is appealing because training data collected while the system is in operation can be used to fine-tune the neural network, and MPC prevents unsafe behavior during those learning transients. This manuscript explains implementation challenges of Deep MPC, algorithmic way to distribute control authority and argues that a poor choice in distributing control authority may lead to poor performance. A reason of poor performance is explained through a numerical experiment on a four-wheeled skid-steer dynamics.

Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems, where Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems are the fundamental building block. To analyze feedback loops with unstable LTI components, the hard SRG is required, since it aptly captures the input/output behavior on the extended $L_2$ space. In this paper, we develop a systematic computational method to exactly compute the hard SRG of LTI systems, which may be unstable and contain integrators. We also study its connection to the Nyquist criterion, including the multivariable case, and demonstrate our method on several examples.

Abstract: We consider the adaptive control problem for discrete-time, nonlinear stochastic systems with linearly parameterised uncertainty. Assuming access to a parameterised family of controllers that can stabilise the system in a bounded set within an informative region of the state space when the parameter is well-chosen, we propose a certainty equivalence learning-based adaptive control strategy, and subsequently derive stability bounds on the closed-loop system that hold for some probabilities. We then show that if the entire state space is informative, and the family of controllers is globally stabilising with appropriately chosen parameters, high probability stability guarantees can be derived.
