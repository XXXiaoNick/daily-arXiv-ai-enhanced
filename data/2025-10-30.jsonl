We extend the Navier-Stokes-based approach from our previous studies\nto characterize contagion dynamics in the European banking system through the\nspectral properties of network evolution operators. Using high-quality\nbilateral exposure data from the European Banking Authority Transparency\nExercise (2014-2023), we estimate the causal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on\nnetwork fragility using spatial difference-in-differences methods adapted from\nour previous studies. Our empirical analysis reveals that COVID-19 elevated\nnetwork fragility, measured by the algebraic connectivity $\\lambda_2$ of the\nsystem Laplacian, by 26.9% above pre-pandemic levels (95% CI: [7.4%, 46.5%],\np<0.05), with effects persisting through 2023. Paradoxically, this occurred\ndespite a 46% reduction in the number of banks, demonstrating that\nconsolidation increased systemic vulnerability by intensifying\ninterconnectedness-consistent with theoretical predictions from continuous\nspatial dynamics. Our findings validate the key predictions from\n\\citet{kikuchi2024dynamical}: treatment effects amplify over time through\nspatial spillovers, consolidation increases fragility when coupling strength\nrises, and systems exhibit structural hysteresis preventing automatic reversion\nto pre-shock equilibria. The results demonstrate the empirical relevance of\ncontinuous functional methods for financial stability analysis and provide new\ninsights for macroprudential policy design. We propose network-based capital\nrequirements targeting spectral centrality and stress testing frameworks\nincorporating diffusion dynamics to address the coupling externalities\nidentified in our analysis."}

Using comprehensive data on six technologies\nadopted by 500 firms over 2010-2023, we document three key findings. First,\ntechnology adoption exhibits strong exponential geographic decay with spatial\ndecay rate $\\kappa \\approx 0.043$ per kilometer, implying a spatial boundary of\n$d^* \\approx 69$ kilometers beyond which spillovers are negligible (R-squared =\n0.99).

For example, convolutional neural networks are able to\nachieve remarkable image classification accuracy across a wide range of\napplications in industry, defense, and other areas. While these machine\nlearning models boast impressive accuracy, a related concern is how to assess\nand maintain calibration in the predictions these models make. A classification\nmodel is said to be well calibrated if its predicted probabilities correspond\nwith the rates events actually occur. While there are many available methods to\nassess machine learning calibration and recalibrate faulty predictions, less\neffort has been spent on developing approaches that continually monitor\npredictive models for potential loss of calibration as time passes. We propose\na cumulative sum-based approach with dynamic limits that enable detection of\nmiscalibration in both traditional process monitoring and concept drift\napplications. This enables early detection of operational context changes that\nimpact image classification performance in the field. The proposed chart can be\nused broadly in any situation where the user needs to monitor probability\npredictions over time for potential lapses in calibration.

Through a series of\ncontrolled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test\nwhether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of\nsubjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and\nbehavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are\nmechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated\nwith deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features\nsharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them\nminimizes such claims.

In this work, we study ICL in pretrained Transformers with\nnonlinear MLP heads on nonlinear tasks drawn from multiple data sources with\nheterogeneous input, task, and noise distributions. We analyze a model where\nthe MLP comprises two layers, with the first layer trained via a single\ngradient step and the second layer fully optimized.

The Index captures technical\nexposure, where AI can perform occupational tasks, not displacement outcomes or\nadoption timelines. Analysis shows that visible AI adoption concentrated in\ncomputing and technology (2.2% of wage value, approx \\$211 billion) represents\nonly the tip of the iceberg. Technical capability extends far below the surface\nthrough cognitive automation spanning administrative, financial, and\nprofessional services (11.7%, approx \\$1.2 trillion). This exposure is fivefold\nlarger and geographically distributed across all states rather than confined to\ncoastal hubs. Traditional indicators such as GDP, income, and unemployment\nexplain less than 5% of this skills-based variation, underscoring why new\nindices are needed to capture exposure in the AI economy. By simulating how\nthese capabilities may spread under scenarios, Iceberg enables policymakers and\nbusiness leaders to identify exposure hotspots, prioritize investments, and\ntest interventions before committing billions to implementation"}

The former reduces computation through\nmodel compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter\noptimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,\nbridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,\nGalen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity\nanalysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer\nefficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections\nand extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness\nand stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,\ndeveloping analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,\nintegrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,\nprobabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog\nnoise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient\nprobabilistic inference directly in hardware.\n  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be\nadvanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation\nfor the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning\nsystems."}

This paper introduces a stochastic optimal control\nframework to address these issues simultaneously, without excessively\nconservative approximations. We opt to model human driver decisions as a Markov\nDecision Process and propose a method for handling collision avoidance between\nnon-convex vehicle shapes by imposing a positive distance constraint between\ncompact sets. In this framework, we investigate three alternative chance\nconstraint formulations. To ensure computational tractability, we introduce\ntight, continuously differentiable reformulations of both the non-convex\ndistance constraints and the chance constraints. The efficacy of our approach\nis demonstrated through simulation studies of two challenging interactive\nscenarios: an unregulated intersection crossing and a highway lane change in\ndense traffic."}

In this\nwork, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a\ncase for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization\nacross interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome\ngenerating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations\ncan effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating\nmechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect\nestimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved\nconfounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of\ntreatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.\nHowever, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which\nis the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based\nestimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating\nconfounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even\nwhen certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an\nIVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a\nworst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal\nestimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer.

Among them, ones that minimize a\nregularized $p$th-order Taylor expansion at each step have been shown to\npossess optimal global complexity, which improves as $p$ increases. The local\nconvergence of such optimization algorithms on functions that have Lipschitz\ncontinuous $p$th derivatives and are uniformly convex of order $q$ has been\nstudied by Doikov and Nesterov [Math. Program., 193 (2022), pp. 315--336]. We\nextend these local convergence results to locally uniformly convex functions\nand fully adaptive methods, which do not need knowledge of the Lipschitz\nconstant, thus providing the first sharp local rates for AR$p$. We discuss the\nsurprising new challenges encountered by nonconvex local models and non-unique\nmodel minimizers. For $p > 2$, our examples show that in particular when using\nthe global minimizer of the subproblem, even asymptotically not all iterations\nneed to be successful. Only if the \"right\" local model minimizer is used, the\n$p/(q-1)$th-order local convergence from the non-adaptive case is preserved for\n$p > q-1$, otherwise the superlinear rate can degrade.

Traditional\napproaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits\nthe opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,\nwe propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection\nand prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may\nindicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT\nScalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures\ncollected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant\nepilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised\nmachine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic\nRegression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression\nachieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced\nperformance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to\ndetect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for\nevaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we\nemployed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to\nmodel temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%\nprediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing\naccessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as\ntraditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to\npredict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to\na more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take\nprecautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications."}

Recently, implicit CoT approaches have\nemerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed\n``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates\nCoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.\nHowever, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)\nthey fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning\n(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,\nresulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on\nreducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the\nconsiderable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning\ntoken. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned\nimplicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,\nwe design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic\nalignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce\nsemantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the\nsecond challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by\nfinetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation.

Despite its theoretical\nappeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of\nautonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal\noption termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred\nchange-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory\nsignals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain\nintra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce\nfunctional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over\nCPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our\nframework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments\nare mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to\nautonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful\nskills.

This\narticle proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be\nconstructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features\nto be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on\nAristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,\ngoal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as\nartifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct\nfrom their designers' intentions.

This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to\nidentify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two\ncategories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing\nknowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior\nwork has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of\nresearch by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted\ntwo experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a\nmanually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both\nclosed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)\nunder paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of\nimplicit gaps inference, we introduce \\textbf{\\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive\nBucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred\nconclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust\ncapability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.\nThis is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants\noften performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for\nsystematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support\nearly-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions.

The numerical methods to do this\nefficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive\namong these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.\nThe fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex\nregions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.\nHowever, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the\nfunction is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such\nas the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We\npropose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in\nreal-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the\noptimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase\noptimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by\nobserving the gradient norm dependence on the loss.

Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an\nIVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a\nworst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal\nestimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is\nshown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments\nfor the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real\ndata experiments to support our case."}

The protocol\nincorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated\naccuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality\nor malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs\nproof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete\ncalibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making\nmulti-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.\nAcross six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and\nAIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to\nadversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation\nof only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while\nretaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a\nfoundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality\ninference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or\nsecurity."}

The\ngoverning partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often\nintractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,\ncharacterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with\nincomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven\nmethods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are\noften physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing\nphysics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex\noperators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we\npropose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally\nadvances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of\nphysical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level\narchitecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level\nlearns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their\ngoverning combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces\nlearning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of\nprior knowledge.

However, current related works suffer\nfrom three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current\nevaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future\ninformation, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack\ndownstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which\nlimits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex\ngraph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We\nsystematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,\ndataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered\nsplitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive\nwindows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without\nfuture information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale\ne-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and\nground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle\nfrom promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight\nframework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,\nJaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based\nencoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp\nachieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with\norders-of-magnitude speedup.

We synthesize early evidence that these\ncapacities buffer individual strain, reduce burnout through social support, and\nlower silent failure in AI-mediated workflows through team norms and\nrisk-responsive governance. We also show that resilience can be cultivated\nthrough training that complements rather than substitutes for structural\nsafeguards. By reframing the AI debate around actionable human resilience, this\narticle offers policymakers, educators, and operators a practical lens to\npreserve human agency and steer responsible adoption."}

This paper fills that gap by systematically\ninvestigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical\nperformance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the\ncomparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our\ncomprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained\nformats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart\nin both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency.

To\nenable statistical inference, we present a novel statistical testing approach\nthat accounts for the joint parameter estimation of mixed-effects regression\nand variational autoencoders. The methodology is applied to quantify the impact\nof treatment switches for patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Here, our\napproach aligns motor performance items from different measurement instruments\nfor mixed-effects regression and maps estimated effects back to the observed\nitem level to quantify the treatment switch effect. Our approach allows for\nmodel selection as well as for assessing effects of treatment switching. The\nresults highlight the potential of modeling in joint latent representations for\naddressing small data challenges."}

We study the resulting\ncomputation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative\nentropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per\niteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence\nlength), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the\ngain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of\nunmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal\nschedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data\ndistribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We\ndefine methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical\nderivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and\ntransparent proofs."}

For example, convolutional neural networks are able to\nachieve remarkable image classification accuracy across a wide range of\napplications in industry, defense, and other areas. While these machine\nlearning models boast impressive accuracy, a related concern is how to assess\nand maintain calibration in the predictions these models make. A classification\nmodel is said to be well calibrated if its predicted probabilities correspond\nwith the rates events actually occur. While there are many available methods to\nassess machine learning calibration and recalibrate faulty predictions, less\neffort has been spent on developing approaches that continually monitor\npredictive models for potential loss of calibration as time passes. We propose\na cumulative sum-based approach with dynamic limits that enable detection of\nmiscalibration in both traditional process monitoring and concept drift\napplications. This enables early detection of operational context changes that\nimpact image classification performance in the field. The proposed chart can be\nused broadly in any situation where the user needs to monitor probability\npredictions over time for potential lapses in calibration. Importantly, our\nmethod operates on probability predictions and event outcomes and does not\nrequire under-the-hood access to the machine learning model."}

A Perspective from Logic Programming", "comment": "Accepted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,\nyet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect\nof human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of\nthe available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference\nrequires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for\nassessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,\nintroducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as\ngenerated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic\nprogram. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids\nunnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word\nproblems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in\nsemantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked\naccuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent\ndistractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through\nirrelevant inferences."}

However, theoretical studies often rely on simplified\narchitectures (e.g., omitting MLPs), data models (e.g., linear regression with\nisotropic inputs), and single-source training, limiting their relevance to\nrealistic settings. In this work, we study ICL in pretrained Transformers with\nnonlinear MLP heads on nonlinear tasks drawn from multiple data sources with\nheterogeneous input, task, and noise distributions. We analyze a model where\nthe MLP comprises two layers, with the first layer trained via a single\ngradient step and the second layer fully optimized. Under high-dimensional\nasymptotics, we prove that such models are equivalent in ICL error to\nstructured polynomial predictors, leveraging results from the theory of\nGaussian universality and orthogonal polynomials. This equivalence reveals that\nnonlinear MLPs meaningfully enhance ICL performance, particularly on nonlinear\ntasks, compared to linear baselines. It also enables a precise analysis of data\nmixing effects: we identify key properties of high-quality data sources (low\nnoise, structured covariances) and show that feature learning emerges only when\nthe task covariance exhibits sufficient structure. These results are validated\nempirically across various activation functions, model sizes, and data\ndistributions. Finally, we experiment with a real-world scenario involving\nmultilingual sentiment analysis where each language is treated as a different\nsource. Our experimental results for this case exemplify how our findings\nextend to real-world cases. Overall, our work advances the theoretical\nfoundations of ICL in Transformers and provides actionable insight into the\nrole of architecture and data in ICL."}

Using the conformal prediction framework, previous\nworks construct sets of LLM responses where the probability of including an\nincorrect response, or error, is capped at a desired user-defined tolerance\nlevel. However, since these methods are based on p-values, they are susceptible\nto p-hacking, i.e., choosing the tolerance level post-hoc can invalidate the\nguarantees. We therefore leverage e-values to complement generative model\noutputs with e-scores as a measure of incorrectness. In addition to achieving\nthe same statistical guarantees as before, e-scores provide users flexibility\nin adaptively choosing tolerance levels after observing the e-scores\nthemselves, by upper bounding a post-hoc notion of error called size\ndistortion. We experimentally demonstrate their efficacy in assessing LLM\noutputs for different correctness types: mathematical factuality and property\nconstraints satisfaction."}
