TL;DR: RxBench是一个用于评估大语言模型在处方审核任务中的综合基准，包含多种题型和14种常见处方错误类型，测试了18个前沿LLM并发现性能分层，领先模型在某些任务上可匹敌或超越执业药师。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在临床决策支持中的快速应用，特别是在处方审核领域，需要系统化、细粒度的评估框架来准确衡量模型性能，识别其能力和局限性。

Method: 开发了RxBench基准，涵盖常见处方审核类别，整合了14种来自权威药学参考资料的常见处方错误类型，包含1150道单选题、230道多选题和879道简答题，所有题目均由经验丰富的临床药师审核。对18个前沿大语言模型进行了基准测试。

Result: 模型性能在不同任务中呈现明显分层：Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06、Grok-4-0709和DeepSeek-R1-0528始终处于第一梯队，在准确性和鲁棒性上优于其他模型。领先LLM在某些任务上可匹敌或超越执业药师表现。通过对中等模型进行针对性微调，获得了在简答题任务上可与领先通用LLM相媲美的专用模型。

Conclusion: RxBench建立了一个标准化、以错误类型为导向的评估框架，不仅揭示了前沿LLM在处方审核中的能力和局限性，还为构建更可靠、更专业的临床工具提供了基础资源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated their integration into clinical decision support, particularly in prescription review. To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from text generators into powerful problem solvers. Yet, many open tasks demand critical thinking, multi-source, and verifiable outputs, which are beyond single-shot prompting or standard retrieval-augmented generation. Recently, numerous studies have explored Deep Research (DR), which aims to combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with external tools, such as search engines, thereby empowering LLMs to act as research agents capable of completing complex, open-ended tasks. This survey presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of deep research systems, including a clear roadmap, foundational components, practical implementation techniques, important challenges, and future directions. Specifically, our main contributions are as follows: (i) we formalize a three-stage roadmap and distinguish deep research from related paradigms; (ii) we introduce four key components: query planning, information acquisition, memory management, and answer generation, each paired with fine-grained sub-taxonomies; (iii) we summarize optimization techniques, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning; and (iv) we consolidate evaluation criteria and open challenges, aiming to guide and facilitate future development. As the field of deep research continues to evolve rapidly, we are committed to continuously updating this survey to reflect the latest progress in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become one of the most transformative tools across many applications, as they have significantly boosted productivity and achieved impressive results in various domains such as finance, healthcare, education, telecommunications, and law, among others. Typically, state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models are developed by large corporations based on large data collections and substantial computational and financial resources required to pretrain such models from scratch. These foundation models then serve as the basis for further development and domain adaptation for specific use cases or tasks. However, given the dynamic and fast-paced nature of launching new foundation models, the process of selecting the most suitable model for a particular use case, application, or domain becomes increasingly complex. We argue that there are two main dimensions that need to be taken into consideration when selecting a model for further training: a qualitative dimension (which model is best suited for a task based on information, for instance, taken from model cards) and a quantitative dimension (which is the best performing model). The quantitative performance of models is assessed through leaderboards, which rank models based on standardized benchmarks and provide a consistent framework for comparing different LLMs. In this work, we address the analysis of the quantitative dimension by exploring the current leaderboards and benchmarks. To illustrate this analysis, we focus on the medical domain as a case study, demonstrating the evolution, current landscape, and practical significance of this quantitative evaluation dimension. Finally, we propose a Model Selection Methodology (MSM), a systematic approach designed to guide the navigation, prioritization, and selection of the model that best aligns with a given use case.

TL;DR: 提出CCD框架，通过轨迹修正机制和自适应采样策略，提升扩散语言模型的生成质量和推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型的推理方法依赖局部即时指标（如置信度、熵），缺乏更可靠的全局视角，导致采样轨迹不一致和生成质量不佳

Method: 提出CCD框架：1）轨迹修正机制，利用历史上下文增强序列连贯性，早期拒绝次优路径；2）自适应采样策略，根据一致性指标动态调整每个步骤的解码预算

Result: 在Dream和LLaDA基准测试中，推理速度提升高达3.48倍，性能提升3.91%

Conclusion: CCD框架通过结合历史上下文和自适应采样，显著改善了扩散语言模型的生成轨迹质量和推理效率

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved significant success due to their any-order generation capabilities. However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.

TL;DR: 提出基于对称和辛微分方程的可逆LLM架构，通过时间可逆动态在反向传播时检索隐藏状态，无需存储中间激活，大幅降低内存消耗，支持更大批处理规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM训练成本高昂且耗时，通常需要微调预训练模型。现有架构需要存储所有中间激活，导致内存消耗大，限制了批处理规模和训练效率。

Method: 1) 引入基于对称和辛微分方程的可逆架构，利用时间可逆动态在反向传播时检索隐藏状态，无需存储激活；2) 提出将现有非可逆LLM转换为可逆架构的高效微调方法。

Result: 在多个数据集和基准测试上，多个LLM模型显示出可比或改进的性能。内存消耗大幅降低，允许在相同内存下处理更大批处理规模，提高吞吐量。

Conclusion: 提出的可逆架构为降低LLM训练和微调的内存与计算成本提供了可扩展且高效的路径，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their expensive and time-consuming training. Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方言识别对下游语音任务有帮助，但传统微调方法计算成本和内存需求高。现有的参数高效微调方法虽然参数效率高，但在内存效率和训练速度方面改进有限

Method: 将最初为语言处理设计的内存高效微调方法应用于通用预训练语音模型，全面分析不同MEFT方法的GPU内存使用和微调速度。以Whisper模型为案例，在KeSpeech数据集上识别六种普通话子方言

Result: GPU内存使用减少高达73.25%，训练速度加速2.1倍，同时保持与普通微调和PEFT方法相当的准确率

Conclusion: 内存高效微调方法在语音模型中有效，能显著降低资源消耗并加速训练，为方言识别等任务提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Dialect Identification (DI) is a task to recognize different dialects within the same language from a speech signal. DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于TF-IDF样本选择和词汇增强的BERT微调方法，在减少75%训练数据的同时保持仇恨言论检测性能，提高计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的仇恨言论持续演变，新俚语和规避性词汇不断出现，传统检测系统难以应对；同时BERT微调需要大量计算资源，限制了实际部署的扩展性

Method: 1) 使用TF-IDF样本选择机制，仅保留信息量最大的75%训练样本；2) 增强BERT分词器，添加特定领域的俚语和词汇变体以更好捕捉仇恨言论术语

Result: 在广泛使用的仇恨言论数据集上，该方法在显著减少训练数据量的情况下仍能保持竞争性性能，同时提高了计算效率

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展和自适应的仇恨内容审核提供了有效方案，通过数据高效策略和词汇增强，在保持性能的同时降低了计算开销

Abstract: Abusive speech on social media poses a persistent and evolving challenge, driven by the continuous emergence of novel slang and obfuscated terms designed to circumvent detection systems. In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.

TL;DR: RESP是一种针对推理大语言模型的自反思结构化剪枝框架，通过自生成校准、仅解码梯度重要性估计和渐进式再生，显著优于现有剪枝方法，在20-40%稀疏度下保持接近稠密模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理大语言模型（如OpenAI o1、DeepSeek-R1、Qwen3）虽然推理能力强，但模型规模大、解码输出长，导致部署成本高且不适合资源受限环境。现有剪枝方法对推理大语言模型效果差，即使中等稀疏度（如20%）也会严重损害准确性和推理连贯性。

Method: RESP框架包含三个关键组件：1）自生成校准：使用模型自身生成推理轨迹作为校准数据；2）仅解码梯度重要性估计：基于解码过程梯度评估参数重要性；3）渐进式再生：随着稀疏度增加保持校准保真度。该方法使剪枝决策与模型推理动态对齐。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B上的实验显示，RESP在GSM8K和MathQA上显著优于现有结构化剪枝方法。在20-30%稀疏度下保持接近稠密模型的准确率，在40%稀疏度下，GSM8K准确率达81.3%，MathQA达59.6%，分别比最强基线提升66.87%和47%。

Conclusion: RESP通过自反思结构化剪枝框架成功解决了推理大语言模型剪枝的挑战，证明了使用模型自生成推理轨迹作为校准信号的重要性，为在资源受限环境中部署高性能推理大语言模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs (RLMs) such as OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3 deliver strong multi-step reasoning through chain-of-thought generation, but their large model sizes and lengthy decode-time outputs make them costly to deploy and unsuitable for resource-constrained settings. To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.

Conclusion: MODOMA方法能够成功建模语言习得过程，为计算语言习得实验提供了新的可能性，验证了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents an initial study performed by the MODOMA system. The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过生成长推理链处理复杂任务，但使用强化学习优化推理能力计算成本高，特别是在涉及大量token处理的叙事相关任务中

Method: 提出LiteReason方法，包含轻量级推理投影器模块，生成连续潜在token帮助跳过推理步骤；在强化学习中，策略模型决定何时激活投影器，在潜在推理和离散推理之间切换

Result: 在情节漏洞检测和书籍章节生成任务中，LiteReason优于潜在推理基线方法，接近非潜在强化学习训练的性能，同时将最终推理长度减少77-92%

Conclusion: LiteReason引导强化学习训练达到性能-计算权衡曲线中更高效的部分，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tackle complex tasks by generating long chains of thought or "reasoning traces" that act as latent variables in the generation of an output given a query. A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.

Abstract: Climate adaptation strategies are proposed in response to climate change. They are practised in agriculture to sustain food production. These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs). We present Climate Adaptation question-answering with Improved Readability and Noted Sources (CAIRNS), a framework that enables experts -- farmer advisors -- to obtain credible preliminary answers from complex evidence sources from the web. It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Using a previously reported dataset of expert-curated question-answers, we show that CAIRNS outperforms the baselines on most of the metrics. Our thorough ablation study confirms the results on all metrics. To validate our LLM-based evaluation, we also report an analysis of correlations against human judgment.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a critical role in the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the impact of prompt specificity - how detailed or vague a prompt is - remains understudied. This paper introduces DETAIL, a framework for evaluating LLM performance across varying levels of prompt specificity. We generate multi-level prompts using GPT-4, quantify specificity via perplexity, and assess correctness using GPT-based semantic equivalence. Experiments on 30 novel reasoning tasks across GPT-4 and O3-mini reveal that specificity improves accuracy, especially for smaller models and procedural tasks. Our results highlight the need for adaptive prompting strategies and provide tools and data to support further research.

### [14] [HealthContradict: Evaluating Biomedical Knowledge Conflicts in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02299)
*Boya Zhang,Alban Bornet,Rui Yang,Nan Liu,Douglas Teodoro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究人员创建了HealthContradict数据集来评估语言模型在矛盾生物医学上下文中的推理能力，发现经过微调的生物医学模型既能利用正确上下文，又能抵抗错误上下文的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型如何使用上下文信息回答健康问题，特别是当上下文存在矛盾时。现有医学问答评估基准在区分模型上下文推理能力方面不足，需要更精细的评估工具。

Method: 创建HealthContradict数据集（920个专家验证实例，包含健康问题、科学证据支持的事实答案和两个矛盾立场的文档）。采用多种提示设置（正确、错误或矛盾上下文），测量对模型输出的影响。

Result: HealthContradict相比现有医学问答基准能更好地区分语言模型的上下文推理能力。实验显示，经过微调的生物医学语言模型的优势不仅在于预训练的参数知识，还在于它们利用正确上下文同时抵抗错误上下文的能力。

Conclusion: 需要专门的数据集来评估语言模型在矛盾生物医学上下文中的推理能力。微调后的生物医学模型展现出强大的上下文利用和抵抗能力，这对医疗AI应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: How do language models use contextual information to answer health questions? How are their responses impacted by conflicting contexts? We assess the ability of language models to reason over long, conflicting biomedical contexts using HealthContradict, an expert-verified dataset comprising 920 unique instances, each consisting of a health-related question, a factual answer supported by scientific evidence, and two documents presenting contradictory stances. We consider several prompt settings, including correct, incorrect or contradictory context, and measure their impact on model outputs. Compared to existing medical question-answering evaluation benchmarks, HealthContradict provides greater distinctions of language models' contextual reasoning capabilities. Our experiments show that the strength of fine-tuned biomedical language models lies not only in their parametric knowledge from pretraining, but also in their ability to exploit correct context while resisting incorrect context.

### [15] [When Does Verification Pay Off? A Closer Look at LLMs as Solution Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02304)
*Jack Lu,Ryan Teehan,Jinran Jin,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了37个LLM模型在9个基准测试上的验证器性能，发现跨模型家族验证效果最好，后训练会降低自我改进但增强跨家族改进，数学和逻辑任务具有最高的可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLM作为问题求解器和解决方案验证器的交互作用研究有限，主要关注自我验证，很少研究验证器如何评估来自同一或不同模型家族模型的输出。现代LLM经过广泛的后训练，但其对验证的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 对37个模型（涵盖多个家族、大小、基础vs后训练变体）在9个基准测试（逻辑推理、结构化谜题、符号计算、数学、常识、事实回忆和领域知识）上进行系统研究。比较自我验证、同家族内验证和跨家族验证。引入并经验验证验证器增益指标来预测测试时基于验证器的拒绝采样带来的性能改进。

Result: 跨家族验证特别有效；后训练会降低自我改进但增强跨家族改进；数学和逻辑任务表现出最高的固有可验证性。分析了验证器增益和误报率等指标如何随模型大小和后训练扩展，并描述了数据集可验证性的差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM验证器交互提供了系统分析，揭示了跨家族验证的优势、后训练对验证能力的影响以及不同任务类型的可验证性差异，为优化LLM验证策略提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务领域的特定领域问答系统面临整合异构知识源并确保准确性和安全性的挑战，现有大语言模型在医疗政策、政府福利等敏感领域存在事实一致性和上下文对齐问题。

Method: 提出KARMA框架：1) 双编码器架构融合结构化与非结构化知识源；2) 门控记忆单元动态调节外部知识集成；3) 安全感知可控解码器，通过安全分类和引导生成技术减少不安全输出。

Result: 在专有QA数据集上的实验表明，KARMA在答案质量和安全性方面均优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为服务场景中构建可信赖且自适应的问答系统提供了全面解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering (QA) systems for services face unique challenges in integrating heterogeneous knowledge sources while ensuring both accuracy and safety. Existing large language models often struggle with factual consistency and context alignment in sensitive domains such as healthcare policies and government welfare. In this work, we introduce Knowledge-Aware Reasoning and Memory-Augmented Adaptation (KARMA), a novel framework designed to enhance QA performance in care scenarios. KARMA incorporates a dual-encoder architecture to fuse structured and unstructured knowledge sources, a gated memory unit to dynamically regulate external knowledge integration, and a safety-aware controllable decoder that mitigates unsafe outputs using safety classification and guided generation techniques. Extensive experiments on a proprietary QA dataset demonstrate that KARMA outperforms strong baselines in both answer quality and safety. This study offers a comprehensive solution for building trustworthy and adaptive QA systems in service contexts.

TL;DR: TaleFrame是一个结合LLM和HCI的故事生成系统，通过将故事结构分解为实体、事件、关系和故事大纲四个基本单元，使用JSON2Story方法将结构化数据转化为连贯故事，提供直观界面支持用户交互式编辑和迭代优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故事生成系统难以准确将用户意图转化为满意输出，主要原因是缺乏细粒度控制和输入规范不清晰，限制了系统的实际应用价值。

Conclusion: TaleFrame成功解决了现有故事生成系统缺乏细粒度控制的问题，通过结构化信息与LLM结合，实现了用户意图到满意故事输出的准确转换，为创意故事生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of natural language generation (NLG) technologies, creative story generation systems have gained increasing attention. However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

*Francesco Paolo Savatteri,Chahan Vidal-Gorène,Florian Cafiero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了在线虚假信息检测的两个实际任务：假新闻检测和病毒性预测。研究发现文本内容是假新闻检测的强判别器，而病毒性预测更困难且对标签构建敏感。轻量级数值特征在计算受限时仍可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估在线虚假信息处理的两个实际任务（假新闻检测和病毒性预测）在操作环境中的有效性，特别是在需要快速反应的场景下。关注点在于比较不同方法的性能，并为实际应用提供指导。

Method: 使用EVONS和FakeNewsNet数据集，比较了文本嵌入（RoBERTa，控制组使用Mistral）与轻量级数值特征（时间、粉丝数、验证状态、点赞数）以及序列模型（GRU、门控架构、Transformer编码器）。采用降维分析（t-SNE vs PCA）来探索数据结构。

Result: 文本内容单独是假新闻检测的强判别器，而纯数值管道在语言模型不可用或计算受限时仍然可行。病毒性预测比假新闻检测明显更困难，且对标签构建高度敏感。降维分析显示非线性结构对病毒性预测比假新闻检测更有信息量。替换RoBERTa为Mistral嵌入仅产生微小差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了评估设计的重要性，并报告了影响该领域可重复性的实际约束。提供了数据集划分和代码，并为指标选择提供指导。结论表明在实际操作环境中需要根据可用资源和时间约束选择适当的方法。

Abstract: We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.

TL;DR: ADORE是一个自持的电商搜索相关性建模框架，通过结合规则感知相关性判别、错误类型感知数据合成和关键属性增强知识蒸馏三大创新，自动生成训练数据并提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商搜索中的相关性建模面临两个主要挑战：基于术语匹配的方法（如BM25）存在语义鸿沟，而神经模型则受限于领域特定困难样本的稀缺性。需要一种能够克服数据稀缺问题，同时增强推理能力的解决方案。

Method: ADORE框架包含三个核心模块：1）规则感知相关性判别模块，使用思维链LLM生成意图对齐的训练数据，并通过Kahneman-Tversky优化与用户行为对齐；2）错误类型感知数据合成模块，自动生成对抗样本来增强鲁棒性；3）关键属性增强知识蒸馏模块，将领域特定属性层次注入到可部署的学生模型中。

Result: 大规模实验和在线A/B测试验证了ADORE的有效性。该框架为工业应用中的资源高效、认知对齐的相关性建模建立了新范式。

Conclusion: ADORE通过自动化标注、对抗生成和蒸馏过程，克服了数据稀缺问题，同时增强了推理能力，为电商搜索相关性建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Relevance modeling in e-commerce search remains challenged by semantic gaps in term-matching methods (e.g., BM25) and neural models' reliance on the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples. We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

TL;DR: CAPO提出了一种基于优势信号的课程学习机制，通过先使用正优势样本进行模仿学习建立基础，再引入负信号培养判别能力，从而提升大语言模型在推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在训练早期阶段不加区分地混合正负优势信号，可能导致指导模糊和收益有限。需要一种更有效的方式来利用优势信号进行训练。

Method: 提出CAPO（课程优势策略优化），采用自适应课程机制：1）首先仅使用正优势样本进行模仿学习，建立稳健基础；2）随后逐步引入负优势信号，培养模型的判别能力；3）兼容多种优化方法（GRPO、PPO、RLOO、Reinforce++）。

Result: 在数学推理任务中实现了稳定且显著的性能提升，并有效泛化到多模态图形用户界面（GUI）推理场景，展现了方法的通用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAPO作为一种通用且鲁棒的优化框架，通过课程学习策略有效利用优势信号，提升了语言模型在复杂推理任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a paradigm for post-training large language models, boosting their reasoning capabilities. Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training. However, the indiscriminate mixing of the two signals in existing methods, especially from the early stages, may lead to ambiguous guidance and limited gains. To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios. Compatible with diverse optimization methods including GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, our method consistently achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks, and further generalizes effectively to multimodal Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning scenarios, establishing itself as a versatile and robust optimization framework.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在总结多文档时存在显著的首因效应，即生成的摘要更倾向于与第一个看到的文档在语义上对齐，这对依赖LLM生成概述的应用和智能体系统构成风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM被广泛用于多文档总结（如Google AI Overviews），但尚不清楚它们是否平等对待所有输入。本研究旨在探究LLM在总结具有不同立场（支持/中立/反对）的文档时是否存在顺序偏见。

Method: 构建40组关于堕胎议题的支持-中立-反对文章三元组，将每组以6种不同顺序排列，使用Gemini 2.5 Flash生成中立概述。通过ROUGE-L（词汇重叠）、BERTScore（语义相似度）和SummaC（事实一致性）评估摘要与源文档的对应关系，使用单因素方差分析和成对比较检验顺序效应。

Result: 单因素方差分析显示BERTScore在所有立场上均存在显著的首因效应，摘要与第一个看到的文章在语义上更一致。成对比较进一步表明位置1与位置2、3有显著差异，而位置2和3之间无差异，确认了LLM对第一个文档的选择性偏好。

Conclusion: LLM在多文档总结中存在明显的顺序偏见，倾向于优先考虑第一个输入文档，这对依赖LLM生成概述的应用和智能体系统构成风险，因为涉及LLM的步骤可能不成比例地影响下游行动。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in settings such as Google's AI Overviews, where it summarizes multiple long documents. However, it remains unclear whether they weight all inputs equally. Focusing on abortion-related news, we construct 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets, permute each triplet into six input orders, and prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a neutral overview. We evaluate each summary against its source articles using ROUGE-L (lexical overlap), BERTScore (semantic similarity), and SummaC (factual consistency). One-way ANOVA reveals a significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, indicating that summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article. Pairwise comparisons further show that Position 1 differs significantly from Positions 2 and 3, while the latter two do not differ from each other, confirming a selective preference for the first document. The findings present risks for applications that rely on LLM-generated overviews and for agentic AI systems, where the steps involving LLMs can disproportionately influence downstream actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）会继承甚至放大预训练语料中的社会偏见，威胁公平性和社会信任。虽然已有研究探索通过编辑LLM参数来减轻偏见，但缺乏对不同模型合并算法的实证比较。

Method: 实证调查了7种模型合并算法：Linear、Karcher Mean、SLERP、NuSLERP、TIES、DELLA和Nearswap，应用于GPT、LLaMA和Qwen家族的13个开源权重模型。使用三个偏见数据集（BBQ、BOLD和HONEST）进行综合评估，并在SuperGLUE基准测试的下游任务中测量这些技术对LLM性能的影响。

Result: 发现偏见减少与下游性能之间存在权衡：实现更大偏见缓解的方法会降低准确性，特别是在需要阅读理解、常识和因果推理的任务上。在合并算法中，Linear、SLERP和Nearswap在保持整体性能的同时持续减少偏见，其中中等插值权重的SLERP成为最平衡的选择。

Conclusion: 模型合并算法在偏见缓解方面具有潜力，但过度的去偏见化或不适当的合并方法可能导致重要语言能力的退化。SLERP在中等权重下提供了偏见减少与性能保持的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to inherit and even amplify societal biases present in their pre-training corpora, threatening fairness and social trust. To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.

### [26] [CREST: Universal Safety Guardrails Through Cluster-Guided Cross-Lingual Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02711)
*Lavish Bansal,Naman Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CREST是一个参数高效的多语言安全分类模型，仅用0.5B参数支持100种语言，通过在13种高资源语言上训练实现跨语言迁移，在安全基准测试中优于同类规模模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全防护主要针对高资源语言，导致使用低资源语言的大量人口缺乏保护。需要开发能够覆盖全球多语言用户的安全系统。

Method: 提出CREST模型，采用参数高效设计，仅在13种高资源语言上训练，利用基于聚类的跨语言迁移技术，将安全能力扩展到100种语言（包括未见过的低资源语言）。

Result: 在六个安全基准测试中，CREST优于同类规模模型，并与参数大5倍以上（2.5B+）的模型竞争。仅用0.5B参数就能有效支持100种语言的安全分类。

Conclusion: 语言特定的安全防护存在局限性，需要开发通用、语言无关的安全系统，以有效扩展到全球人口。CREST展示了通过跨语言迁移实现高效多语言安全保护的可行性。

Abstract: Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications. However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages. To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

### [27] [Emergent Bayesian Behaviour and Optimal Cue Combination in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02719)
*Julian Ma,Jun Wang,Zafeirios Fountas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在显式推理表现出色，但其隐式计算策略未充分探索。研究通过心理物理学范式评估LLMs是否表现出类似人类的最优贝叶斯多模态整合能力，发现准确率高的模型不一定具有稳健的不确定性处理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在感知任务中能直觉地使用接近最优的贝叶斯策略处理噪声信号，但LLMs的隐式计算策略是否具有类似的最优多模态整合能力尚不清楚。现有研究主要关注LLMs的显式推理能力，而忽略了其内在的计算原理。

Method: 引入心理物理学范式，创建BayesBench基准测试，包含四个文本和图像的量级估计任务（长度、位置、距离、持续时间）。评估9个不同LLMs和人类判断作为校准。通过控制噪声、上下文和指令提示的消融实验，测量多模态线索整合的性能、行为和效率。引入贝叶斯一致性分数来检测贝叶斯一致的行为变化。

Result: 虽然能力强的模型通常以贝叶斯一致的方式适应，但准确率不能保证稳健性。GPT-5 Mini在文本任务中达到完美准确率，但在视觉线索整合上效率低下。这表明能力与策略之间存在关键分离，以准确率为中心的基准测试可能过度关注性能而忽略了脆弱的不确定性处理。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出对不确定性的原则性处理能力，准确率与贝叶斯倾向之间存在相关性。研究揭示了准确率基准的局限性，强调了评估不确定性处理策略的重要性。发布的心理物理学基准和一致性指标可为未来多模态架构设计提供参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

TL;DR: SurveyEval是一个用于评估LLM自动生成综述系统的综合基准，从整体质量、大纲连贯性和参考文献准确性三个维度进行评估，发现专用综述生成系统比通用长文本系统表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM自动综述系统的发展，这些系统能够集成检索、组织和内容合成到端到端生成流程中。然而，如何评估这种复杂系统仍然是一个重大挑战，现有研究主要关注开发新生成流程而缺乏评估方法。

Method: 提出了SurveyEval基准，从三个维度评估自动生成的综述：整体质量、大纲连贯性和参考文献准确性。在7个学科领域进行扩展评估，并增强LLM-as-a-Judge框架，加入人类参考以加强评估与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 评估结果显示，通用长文本或论文写作系统倾向于生成质量较低的综述，而专门的综述生成系统能够提供显著更高质量的结果。SurveyEval可以作为可扩展的测试平台来理解和改进跨学科和评估标准的自动综述系统。

Conclusion: SurveyEval为解决LLM自动综述系统评估挑战提供了一个全面基准，展示了专用系统相对于通用系统的优势，并可作为未来研究和改进的基础平台。

Abstract: LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address the increasing size of Large Language Models (LLMs). Currently, many newly introduced PEFT methods are challenging to replicate, deploy, or compare with one another. To address this, we introduce PEFT-Factory, a unified framework for efficient fine-tuning LLMs using both off-the-shelf and custom PEFT methods. While its modular design supports extensibility, it natively provides a representative set of 19 PEFT methods, 27 classification and text generation datasets addressing 12 tasks, and both standard and PEFT-specific evaluation metrics. As a result, PEFT-Factory provides a ready-to-use, controlled, and stable environment, improving replicability and benchmarking of PEFT methods.

TL;DR: UniFact是一个统一评估框架，用于直接比较事实验证(FV)和幻觉检测(HD)两种范式，发现两者互补，混合方法性能最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常产生看似流畅但事实错误的幻觉内容，这损害了信任并阻碍实际应用。目前存在模型中心的幻觉检测(HD)和文本中心的事实验证(FV)两种孤立发展的研究范式，这种分离阻碍了整体进展。

Method: 提出UniFact统一评估框架，通过动态生成模型输出和相应的事实性标签，实现FV和HD在实例级别的直接比较。进行大规模实验，涵盖多个LLM家族和检测方法。

Result: 三个关键发现：(1) 没有哪种范式普遍优越；(2) HD和FV捕捉了事实错误的互补方面；(3) 整合两种方法的混合方法始终达到最先进性能。首次深入分析了FV和HD为何分化。

Conclusion: 需要一个新的集成研究议程，将幻觉检测和事实验证统一起来。实验结果支持两者统一的必要性，为LLM的事实性评估提供了综合框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit hallucinations, generating content that appears fluent and coherent but is factually incorrect. Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一种三层数据合成方法，用于对话式广义指代表达式理解(GREC)，通过平衡真实性和可控性生成可扩展的监督数据，显著提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话式广义指代表达式理解(GREC)需要在复杂视觉场景中定位表达和无限目标，并解决长对话上下文中的共指问题。现有系统在训练和评估领域之间存在分布偏移问题，且标注对话接地数据稀缺

Method: 采用三层数据合成方法，平衡真实性和可控性，为对话条件接地生成可扩展的监督数据

Result: 在合成数据上进行微调后，相比先前方法在标准评估指标上获得了一致且显著的改进

Conclusion: 提出的数据合成方法有效解决了GREC任务中的数据稀缺和分布偏移问题，为对话条件接地提供了可扩展的监督解决方案

Abstract: Dialogue-Based Generalized Referring Expressions Comprehension (GREC) requires models to ground the expression and unlimited targets in complex visual scenes while resolving coreference across a long dialogue context. However, existing systems struggle under distribution shift between training and evaluation domains, a gap exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated dialogue grounding data. We address this challenge with a three-tier data-synthesis method that balances realism and controllability to produce scalable supervision for dialogue-conditioned grounding. Fine-tuning on the synthesized data yields consistent, substantial improvements over prior approaches across standard evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: TriLex框架通过三阶段检索增强方法扩展低资源非洲语言情感词典，提升情感分析性能，AfroXLMR在isiXhosa和isiZulu上F1分数超80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源非洲语言在情感分析中代表性不足，限制了多语言NLP系统的词汇覆盖和性能表现。

Method: 提出TriLex三阶段检索增强框架：1) 基于语料库的提取；2) 跨语言映射；3) RAG驱动的词汇精炼，用于系统扩展低资源语言情感词典。

Result: AfroXLMR表现最佳，在isiXhosa和isiZulu上F1分数超过80%，具有强跨语言稳定性；AfriBERTa虽未预训练目标语言，仍达到约64% F1分数；两种模型均优于传统机器学习基线，集成分析进一步提升了精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TriLex是用于低资源南非语言多语言情感词典扩展和情感建模的可扩展有效框架。

Abstract: Low-resource African languages remain underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting both lexical coverage and the performance of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness. The findings establish TriLex as a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages.

*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出stable rank作为从模型内部表示中提取的无标注质量信号，并基于此开发SR-GRPO强化学习方法，无需外部监督即可提升LLM对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法依赖外部监督存在诸多限制：人工标注稀缺且主观，奖励模型易受奖励攻击，自评估方法存在提示敏感性和偏见。需要寻找更可靠的内在质量信号。

Method: 提出stable rank概念，通过计算隐藏状态总方差与主导方向方差的比值来度量表示的有效维度，捕捉质量信息在表示维度上的分布。基于此开发Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO)，将stable rank作为强化学习的奖励信号。

Result: stable rank在RewardBench上达到84.04%准确率，通过Best-of-N采样比贪婪解码平均提升11.3个百分点任务准确率。SR-GRPO在无外部监督下，将Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct在STEM任务上提升10%，数学推理上提升19%，优于学习奖励模型和自评估基线。

Conclusion: 质量信号可以从模型内部几何结构中提取，这为无需外部监督的可扩展对齐提供了一条新路径，stable rank作为内在质量信号具有实用价值。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on external supervision, which faces critical limitations: human annotations are scarce and subjective, reward models are vulnerable to reward hacking, and self-evaluation methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and biases. In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines. Our findings demonstrate that quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision.

Motivation: LLM在中医领域的应用需要评估其临床能力，但现有基准局限于知识问答或辨证准确性，缺乏对治疗决策的评估。中医"辨证论治"的个体化、整体性和多样性特点使得评估更具挑战性。

Method: 提出基于临床病例的综合基准TCM-BEST4SDT，包含中医基础知识、医学伦理、LLM内容安全和辨证论治四个任务。采用选择题评估、法官模型评估和奖励模型评估三种机制，其中奖励模型专门用于量化处方-证候一致性。数据标注遵循严格流程，由中医专家主导。

Result: 在15个主流LLM（包括通用和中医领域模型）上验证了TCM-BEST4SDT的有效性。基准现已公开可用，以促进智能中医研究发展。

Conclusion: TCM-BEST4SDT是首个全面评估LLM在中医辨证论治临床能力的基准，填补了现有评估在治疗决策方面的空白，为智能中医发展提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain presents an urgent need to assess their clinical application capabilities. However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.

Conclusion: BOOM系统能够为学生提供母语访问讲座的完整体验，同时保留原始内容的完整性。这种多模态翻译方法对于教育内容本地化具有重要意义。

Abstract: The globalization of education and rapid growth of online learning have made localizing educational content a critical challenge. Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering.

Conclusion: 系统提示优化是实现准确和稳健多语言LLM行为的可扩展路径。通过优化系统提示，可以在不修改模型的情况下显著提升跨语言性能，为多语言应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.

TL;DR: 该研究在BLP 2025共享任务的孟加拉语仇恨言论检测子任务中，评估了传统机器学习方法和基于Transformer的预训练模型，发现语言特定的预训练模型BanglaBERT表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为拥有超过2.3亿使用者的语言，在计算资源中代表性不足，特别是在社交媒体自动审核方面存在需求。低资源语言的仇恨言论识别面临数据集不足、拼写异质性和语言多样性等挑战。

Method: 研究复制了官方基线方法（多数投票、随机、支持向量机），并增加了逻辑回归、随机森林和决策树作为基线。同时使用了基于Transformer的模型：DistilBERT、BanglaBERT、m-BERT和XLM-RoBERTa进行仇恨言论分类。

Result: 所有基于Transformer的模型（除DistilBERT外）在子任务中都优于基线方法。在Transformer模型中，BanglaBERT在两个子任务中都表现最佳。尽管规模较小，BanglaBERT优于m-BERT和XLM-RoBERTa，表明语言特定预训练的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了预训练语言模型在低资源孟加拉语中的潜力和必要性，语言特定的预训练对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: Hate speech recognition in low-resource languages remains a difficult problem due to insufficient datasets, orthographic heterogeneity, and linguistic variety. Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the growing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under-represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official baselines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vector Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree as baseline methods. We also utilized transformer-based models such as DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed baseline methods for the subtasks, except for DistilBERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language-specific pre-training is very important. Our results highlight the potential and need for pre-trained language models for the low-resource Bangla language.

TL;DR: ThinkMerge：一种无需训练的解码策略，通过并行推理轨迹的logits平均来提升开放端推理任务性能，优于多数投票法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数投票法在封闭式问答中有效，但不适用于代码生成和网络深度研究等开放式推理任务，因为完整解决方案的"多数"难以定义

Method: 提出ThinkMerge解码策略：运行K个并行推理轨迹，在同步点平均它们的下一个token logits，生成单个连贯输出；与vLLM/SGLang无缝集成，兼容Top-p/Top-k等标准解码技术

Result: 在AIME和GPQA上匹配或超越多数投票法；在LiveCodeBench（困难）上，DeepCoder-14B-Preview的pass@1提升+8.28%，Qwen3-8B提升+7.58%；在GAIA、BrowseComp-en/zh和XbenchDeepSearch上提升网络深度研究代理性能

Conclusion: 并行测试时扩展可以在不依赖完整输出投票的情况下有益于开放式推理，ThinkMerge为开放端任务提供了有效的解码策略

Abstract: Majority voting has proven effective for close-ended question answering by aggregating parallel reasoning traces. However, it is not directly applicable to open-ended reasoning, such as code generation and web-based deep research, where a "majority" over complete solutions is ill-defined. We introduce ThinkMerge, a training-free, plug-and-play decoding strategy that runs K parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points to produce a single coherent output. ThinkMerge integrates seamlessly with vLLM/SGLang and remains compatible with standard decoding techniques such as Top-p/Top-k. Empirically, it matches or surpasses majority voting on AIME and GPQA, while delivering consistent gains on open-ended coding tasks: on LiveCodeBench (hard), pass@1 improves by +8.28% for DeepCoder-14B-Preview and +7.58% for Qwen3-8B. Beyond code, we further show that ThinkMerge improves web-based deep-research agents (e.g., WebSailor-7B/32B) across GAIA, BrowseComp-en/zh, and XbenchDeepSearch. These results demonstrate that parallel test-time scaling can benefit open-ended reasoning without relying on voting over complete outputs.

TL;DR: SchED是一种无需训练、模型无关的早期退出算法，通过聚合全跨度logit边际并在满足平滑进度相关置信度阈值时停止解码，显著加速扩散大语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)相比自回归模型具有优势，但其迭代采样过程缓慢，严重限制了实际应用。需要一种能够在不牺牲性能的情况下加速dLLM推理的方法。

Method: SchED是一种训练免费、模型无关的早期退出算法：1) 聚合全跨度logit边际；2) 当达到平滑进度相关置信度阈值时停止解码；3) 无需额外训练，适用于不同dLLM家族。

Result: 在指令调优模型上获得3.8-4.0倍加速，同时保持99.8-100%的基准性能；在基础模型上获得一致加速增益，性能保持99.1-100%，激进设置下可达2.34倍加速。在QPS(γ=4)指标下明显优于现有早期退出方法。

Conclusion: SchED通过将真正的置信度稳定转化为计算节省，使dLLM解码显著更高效，解决了扩散大语言模型推理缓慢的瓶颈问题，为实际应用提供了可行的加速方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models, but their practical utility is severely hampered by slow, iterative sampling. We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.

TL;DR: AutoNeural：针对NPU设计的视觉-语言模型架构，通过卷积骨干网络和状态空间模型混合设计，实现整数推理优化，显著提升边缘AI效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前为GPU设计的视觉-语言模型在NPU上表现不佳，主要由于ViT量化脆弱性和自回归注意力机制的I/O限制，无法充分利用NPU的高算术吞吐量

Method: 1. 用MobileNetV5风格的深度可分离卷积骨干网络替代标准ViT编码器，确保激活分布有界以实现稳定INT4/8/16量化；2. 语言骨干网络集成状态空间模型原理与Transformer层，使用门控卷积实现线性时间复杂度，消除KV缓存的内存I/O开销

Result: 视觉编码器量化误差降低7倍，端到端延迟降低14倍，解码速度提升3倍，上下文窗口长度提升4倍；在Qualcomm SA8295P SoC上验证了驾驶舱应用的实时性能

Conclusion: 针对NPU约束重新设计模型拓扑是实现稳健多模态边缘智能的前提，AutoNeural架构展示了硬件感知设计的重要性

Abstract: While Neural Processing Units (NPUs) offer high theoretical efficiency for edge AI, state-of-the-art Vision--Language Models (VLMs) tailored for GPUs often falter on these substrates. We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications. Our results highlight that rethinking model topology specifically for NPU constraints is a prerequisite for robust multi-modal edge intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在將自然語言轉換為形式邏輯時會產生幻覺（錯誤輸出），這對於需要精確性的邏輯翻譯任務（如自動推理、軟體規格驗證）構成挑戰。

Method: 結合傳統NLP技術（自定義文法）、符號計算庫和微調的語言模型，將英文句子轉換為邏輯表達式，再轉為CNF形式供可滿足性求解器使用。

Result: 初步實驗顯示，在不同文法設定下訓練的微調模型能夠有意識地修正原始模型產生的同類幻覺，提供可靠的CNF生成。

Conclusion: 該框架能有效減少LLM在邏輯翻譯任務中的幻覺問題，為自動推理和軟體驗證提供更可靠的基礎。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), have motivated the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal logic without human intervention. This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.

TL;DR: MoCoP是一个无数据集、闭环的道德一致性评估框架，用于持续评估和解释LLM的道德稳定性，通过三层分析揭示道德一致性与毒性维度呈强负相关，与响应延迟无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐框架依赖静态数据集和事后评估，难以捕捉道德推理在不同上下文或时间尺度上的演变，需要一种动态、持续评估LLM道德一致性的方法。

Method: 提出Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP)，包含三层：词汇完整性分析、语义风险估计和基于推理的判断建模，采用自维持架构自主生成、评估和精炼伦理场景，无需外部监督。

Result: 在GPT-4-Turbo和DeepSeek上的实证结果显示，MoCoP有效捕捉纵向道德行为，道德与毒性维度呈强负相关(rET=-0.81, p<0.001)，与响应延迟几乎无关(rEL≈0)。

Conclusion: MoCoP将伦理评估重新定义为动态、模型无关的道德内省形式，为可扩展的持续审计提供了可重复基础，推进了自主AI系统中计算道德的研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.

Result: 基于国际公司数据的10个交易日预测数值模拟显示，这种结合基本面和技术面变量的混合方法优于不结合这两类变量的常规方法。在决策树算法中，随机森林表现最佳。

Conclusion: 整合技术面和基本面变量的混合交易系统能够显著提升股票交易算法的性能，其中随机森林是决策树算法中的最佳选择，且通过选择合适的技术变量可以进一步优化预测效果。

Abstract: The aim of this paper is the analysis and selection of stock trading systems that combine different models with data of different nature, such as financial and microeconomic information. Specifically, based on previous work by the authors and applying advanced techniques of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, our objective is to formulate trading algorithms for the stock market with empirically tested statistical advantages, thus improving results published in the literature. Our approach integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with algorithms based on decision trees, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. While the former analyze price patterns of financial assets, the latter are fed with economic data of companies. Numerical simulations of algorithmic trading with data from international companies and 10-weekday predictions confirm that an approach based on both fundamental and technical variables can outperform the usual approaches, which do not combine those two types of variables. In doing so, Random Forest turned out to be the best performer among the decision trees. We also discuss how the prediction performance of such a hybrid approach can be boosted by selecting the technical variables.

Motivation: 研究COS方法的截断误差，提供比先前分析更广泛适用的收敛条件，特别是为了处理重尾分布

Method: 分析COS方法的截断误差，建立收敛的数学条件：在一维情况下，密度函数需属于L1和L2空间，且具有大于1阶的有限加权L2矩；在多维情况下，矩的阶数需超过维度

Result: 提出的条件扩展了先前分析覆盖的密度函数类别，能够处理如小自由度Student t分布等重尾分布

Conclusion: 建立了COS方法收敛的简单可验证条件，显著扩展了该方法的应用范围，使其能够处理更广泛的分布类型

Abstract: We study the truncation error of the COS method and give simple, verifiable conditions that guarantee convergence. In one dimension, COS is admissible when the density belongs to both L1 and L2 and has a finite weighted L2 moment of order strictly greater than one. We extend the result to multiple dimensions by requiring the moment order to exceed the dimension. These conditions enlarge the class of densities covered by previous analyses and include heavy-tailed distributions such as Student t with small degrees of freedom.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变分正则化和贝叶斯推理方法在高维或复杂物理模型下计算受限。PINNs虽然通过嵌入物理定律解决逆问题，但缺乏对训练数据生成、建模和测量不确定性的显式处理。

Conclusion: BPINN-IP框架统一了物理约束、先验知识和数据驱动推理，同时通过后验分布实现不确定性量化，为逆问题提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse problems arise across scientific and engineering domains, where the goal is to infer hidden parameters or physical fields from indirect and noisy observations. Classical approaches, such as variational regularization and Bayesian inference, provide well established theoretical foundations for handling ill posedness. However, these methods often become computationally restrictive in high dimensional settings or when the forward model is governed by complex physics. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising framework for solving inverse problems by embedding physical laws directly into the training process of neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on the Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Network (BPINN) framework, extending classical PINNs by explicitly incorporating training data generation, modeling and measurement uncertainties through Bayesian prior modeling and doing inference with the posterior laws. Also, as we focus on the inverse problems, we call this method BPINN-IP, and we show that the standard PINN formulation naturally appears as its special case corresponding to the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate. This unified formulation allows simultaneous exploitation of physical constraints, prior knowledge, and data-driven inference, while enabling uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we consider inverse problems arising in infrared image processing, including deconvolution and super-resolution, and present results on both simulated and real industrial data.

Motivation: 为了解决高斯过程回归的可扩展性限制，张量网络方法被提出，但将其扩展到完全概率公式存在设计挑战，特别是对于张量列车模型，不清楚哪个TT核应该以贝叶斯方式处理。

Method: 提出贝叶斯张量列车核机器，对选定的TT核应用拉普拉斯近似来估计后验分布，对精度超参数使用变分推理，避免了交叉验证的需要。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了张量列车核机器完全贝叶斯化的设计挑战，提供了高效的概率建模框架，在保持可扩展性的同时实现了完全概率推理。

Abstract: To address the scalability limitations of Gaussian process (GP) regression, several approximation techniques have been proposed. One such method is based on tensor networks, which utilizes an exponential number of basis functions without incurring exponential computational cost. However, extending this model to a fully probabilistic formulation introduces several design challenges. In particular, for tensor train (TT) models, it is unclear which TT-core should be treated in a Bayesian manner. We introduce a Bayesian tensor train kernel machine that applies Laplace approximation to estimate the posterior distribution over a selected TT-core and employs variational inference (VI) for precision hyperparameters. Experiments show that core selection is largely independent of TT-ranks and feature structure, and that VI replaces cross-validation while offering up to 65x faster training. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated on an inverse dynamics problem.

Conclusion: 该工作扩展了对比学习的理论视角，为现实世界中下游任务可能超出预训练类别分布的情况提供了理论框架和泛化保证，有助于理解对比学习在领域泛化场景中的表现。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is among the most popular and powerful approaches for self-supervised representation learning, where the goal is to map semantically similar samples close together while separating dissimilar ones in the latent space. Existing theoretical methods assume that downstream task classes are drawn from the same latent class distribution used during the pretraining phase. However, in real-world settings, downstream tasks may not only exhibit distributional shifts within the same label space but also introduce new or broader label spaces, leading to domain generalization challenges. In this work, we introduce novel generalization bounds that explicitly account for both types of mismatch: domain shift and domain generalization. Specifically, we analyze scenarios where downstream tasks either (i) draw classes from the same latent class space but with shifted distributions, or (ii) involve new label spaces beyond those seen during pretraining. Our analysis reveals how the performance of contrastively learned representations depends on the statistical discrepancy between pretraining and downstream distributions. This extended perspective allows us to derive provable guarantees on the performance of learned representations on average classification tasks involving class distributions outside the pretraining latent class set.

Conclusion: 成功识别了保持微分平坦性的动态耦合类型，并设计了可扩展的分布式控制器，在耦合非线性系统中实现了精确跟踪，为分布式控制提供了新框架。

Abstract: We study distributed control for a network of nonlinear, differentially flat subsystems subject to dynamic coupling. Although differential flatness simplifies planning and control for isolated subsystems, the presence of coupling can destroy this property for the overall joint system. Focusing on subsystems in pure-feedback form, we identify a class of compatible lower-triangular dynamic couplings that preserve flatness and guarantee that the flat outputs of the subsystems remain the flat outputs of the coupled system. Further, we show that the joint flatness diffeomorphism can be constructed from those of the individual subsystems and, crucially, its sparsity structure reflects that of the coupling. Exploiting this structure, we synthesize a distributed tracking controller that computes control actions from local information only, thereby ensuring scalability. We validate our proposed framework on a simulated example of planar quadrotors dynamically coupled via aerodynamic downwash, and show that the distributed controller achieves accurate trajectory tracking.

Abstract: We address the problem of verifying closed-loop contraction in nonlinear control systems whose controller and contraction metric are both parameterized by neural networks. By leveraging interval analysis and interval bound propagation, we derive a tractable and scalable sufficient condition for closed-loop contractivity that reduces to checking that the dominant eigenvalue of a symmetric Metzler matrix is nonpositive. We combine this sufficient condition with a domain partitioning strategy to integrate this sufficient condition into training. The proposed approach is validated on an inverted pendulum system, demonstrating the ability to learn neural network controllers and contraction metrics that provably satisfy the contraction condition.

Abstract: Model-based filtering is often carried out while subject to an imperfect model, as learning partially-observable stochastic systems remains a challenge. Recent work on Bayesian inference found that tempering the likelihood or full posterior of an imperfect model can improve predictive accuracy, as measured by expected negative log likelihood. In this paper, we develop the tempered Bayes filter, improving estimation performance through both of the aforementioned, and one newly introduced, modalities. The result admits a recursive implementation with a computational complexity no higher than that of the original Bayes filter. Our analysis reveals that -- besides the well-known fact in the field of Bayesian inference that likelihood tempering affects the balance between prior and likelihood -- full-posterior tempering tunes the level of entropy in the final belief distribution. We further find that a region of the tempering space can be understood as interpolating between the Bayes- and MAP filters, recovering these as special cases. Analytical results further establish conditions under which a tempered Bayes filter achieves improved predictive performance. Specializing the results to the linear Gaussian case, we obtain the tempered Kalman filter. In this context, we interpret how the parameters affect the Kalman state estimate and covariance propagation. Empirical results confirm that our method consistently improves predictive accuracy over the Bayes filter baseline.

Abstract: Wildlife monitoring with drones must balance competing demands: approaching close enough to capture behaviorally-relevant video while avoiding stress responses that compromise animal welfare and data validity. Human operators face a fundamental attentional bottleneck: they cannot simultaneously control drone operations and monitor vigilance states across entire animal groups. By the time elevated vigilance becomes obvious, an adverse flee response by the animals may be unavoidable. To solve this challenge, we present an edge-native, behavior-adaptive drone system for wildlife monitoring. This configurable decision-support system augments operator expertise with automated group-level vigilance monitoring. Our system continuously tracks individual behaviors using YOLOv11m detection and YOLO-Behavior classification, aggregates vigilance states into a real-time group stress metric, and provides graduated alerts (alert vigilance to flee response) with operator-tunable thresholds for context-specific calibration. We derive service-level objectives (SLOs) from video frame rates and behavioral dynamics: to monitor 30fps video streams in real-time, our system must complete detection and classification within 33ms per frame. Our edge-native pipeline achieves 23.8ms total inference on GPU-accelerated hardware, meeting this constraint with a substantial margin. Retrospective analysis of seven wildlife monitoring missions demonstrates detection capability and quantifies the cost of reactive control: manual piloting results in 14 seconds average adverse behavior duration with 71.9% usable frames. Our analysis reveals operators could have received actionable alerts 51s before animals fled in 57% of missions. Simulating 5-second operator intervention yields a projected performance of 82.8% usable frames with 1-second adverse behavior duration,a 93% reduction compared to manual piloting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模场景如搜救或环境监测中，传统均匀覆盖方法无法处理区域优先级差异，需要智能体根据区域重要性调整覆盖努力。

Method: 基于最优传输理论，利用预构建的参考分布分配智能体覆盖努力；分析Wasserstein距离的收敛条件，推导无约束情况下的解析最优控制律，并提出约束场景的数值方法。

Result: 在一阶动力学和线性化四旋翼模型上的仿真表明，DPC能生成与参考分布高度匹配的轨迹，优于现有覆盖方法。

Conclusion: DPC为多智能体非均匀区域覆盖提供了一种有效的控制策略，通过最优传输理论框架实现了对优先级区域的适应性覆盖。

Abstract: This paper presents Density-based Predictive Control (DPC), a novel multi-agent control strategy for efficient non-uniform area coverage, grounded in optimal transport theory. In large-scale scenarios such as search and rescue or environmental monitoring, traditional uniform coverage fails to account for varying regional priorities. DPC leverages a pre-constructed reference distribution to allocate agents' coverage efforts, spending more time in high-priority or densely sampled regions. We analyze convergence conditions using the Wasserstein distance, derive an analytic optimal control law for unconstrained cases, and propose a numerical method for constrained scenarios. Simulations on first-order dynamics and linearized quadrotor models demonstrate that DPC achieves trajectories closely matching the non-uniform reference distribution, outperforming existing coverage methods.

Abstract: The electrification of off-road heavy equipment presents operational challenges for agencies serving remote sites with limited fixed charging infrastructure. Existing mobile fast charging vehicle (MFCV) planning approaches typically treat fleet design and routing as separate problems, fixing vehicle characteristics before dispatch. This paper formulates a fleet size and mix capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (FSMCVRPTW) for MFCV deployment, jointly optimizing fleet composition, charger specifications, routing, and scheduling within a unified mixed-integer linear program. The model incorporates heterogeneous MFCV types with varying power ratings, battery capacities, fuel range, and cost structures, minimizing total daily cost from labor, fuel, amortized capital expenditure, and energy purchase under temporal service windows, resource budgets, and energy-delivery constraints. The formulation is implemented in Python/Gurobi and applied to two case studies using California Department of Transportation wheel-loader data in Los Angeles (dense urban) and Truckee (sparse mountainous). Results show that simultaneous optimization yields compact, well-utilized fleets that meet all service windows while revealing strong sensitivity of unit cost to demand density and geography. The proposed FSMCVRPTW framework provides a generalizable decision-support methodology that co-designs fleet size, charger power, routing, and service schedules in a single optimization layer for context-aware, cost-efficient mobile fast charging.

Motivation: 经典PID控制在工业过程中普遍应用，但对于非线性不确定MIMO二阶系统缺乏严格明确的设计理论，现有方法多为定性调参

Method: 考虑一类具有不确定动态和未知但严格正输入增益的系统，利用状态变量Jacobian的界来表征非线性不确定性，构造三维PID增益区域

Result: 建立了保证全局稳定性和渐近跟踪的充分增益区域，推导了相应的必要区域，揭示了处理最坏情况不确定性所需的固有保守性；在额外结构假设下，充分必要区域重合

Conclusion: 提供了非线性不确定MIMO二阶系统PID控制的闭式设计理论，增益区域仅依赖于Jacobian界和输入增益下界，相比文献中的定性调参方法更具明确性

Abstract: As is well known, classical PID control is ubiquitous in industrial processes, yet a rigorous and explicit design theory for nonlinear uncertain MIMO second-order systems remains underdeveloped. In this paper we consider a class of such systems with both uncertain dynamics and an unknown but strictly positive input gain, where the nonlinear uncertainty is characterized by bounds on the Jacobian with respect to the state variables. We explicitly construct a three-dimensional region for the PID gains that is sufficient to guarantee global stability and asymptotic tracking of constant references for all nonlinearities satisfying these Jacobian bounds. We then derive a corresponding necessary region, thereby revealing the inherent conservatism required to cope with worst-case uncertainties. Moreover, under additional structural assumptions on the nonlinearities, these sufficient and necessary regions coincide, yielding a precise necessary-and-sufficient characterization of all globally stabilizing PID gains. All these regions are given in closed form and depend only on the prescribed Jacobian bounds and the known lower bound of the input gain, in contrast to many qualitative tuning methods in the literature.

Conclusion: 该研究为无信号灯十字路口的自动驾驶车辆协调提供了综合考虑安全、效率和公平性的控制框架，并揭示了干预时机和公平约束对系统性能的重要影响。

Abstract: Intersections present significant challenges in traffic management, where ensuring safety and efficiency is essential for effective flow. However, these goals are often achieved at the expense of fairness, which is critical for trustworthiness and long-term sustainability. This paper investigates how the timing of centralized intervention affects the management of autonomous agents at a signal-less, orthogonal intersection, while satisfying safety constraints, evaluating efficiency, and ensuring fairness. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach is used to optimize agent coordination within a circular control zone centered at the intersection. We introduce the concept of fairness, measured via pairwise reversal counts, and incorporate fairness constraints into the MILP framework. We then study the relationship between fairness and system efficiency and its impact on platoon formation. Finally, simulation studies analyze the effectiveness of early versus late intervention strategies and fairness-aware control, focusing on safe, efficient, and robust management of agents within the control zone.

Abstract: This article deals with the implementation of the Smith Predictor for state feedback control in state space representation. The desired control law, obtained using partial differential equations and backstepping control, contains an integral term that has to be approximated for implementation. In this article, we propose a new way to implement this control law using a dynamic controller. The control law is composed of a state feedback term and a dynamic term that approaches the integral term that has to be estimated for implementation. Using a Lyapunov functional, we provide sufficient conditions, in terms of a linear matrix inequality, to guarantee that the closed-loop system is stable when the proposed control law is applied. We use three examples, taken from the literature, to show the benefits of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 传统同步发电机与下垂控制型电网形成换流器在惯性动态特性上存在根本差异，当前行业模仿同步发电机高惯性、大下垂的做法可能限制了逆变器资源的潜力，低下垂、低虚拟惯性反而能获得更好的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究同步发电机与电网形成换流器的核心惯性动态特性及其相互作用，评估当前行业模仿同步发电机控制策略的合理性，探索逆变器资源在电网中的最优控制方式。

Method: 采用模态分析方法，研究调速器控制同步发电机和下垂控制型电网形成换流器的惯性动态特性，分析两者耦合时的相互作用，比较不同控制参数对系统稳定性的影响。

Result: 同步发电机存在固有权衡：大下垂常数可提高涡轮-调速器模式阻尼，但会增加稳态频率偏差和对二次调节的依赖。而电网形成换流器则相反：减小下垂常数同时降低稳态频率偏差并增加阻尼，虚拟惯性可自由选择。用等效下垂和惯性的电网形成换流器替换一台同步发电机可显著改善摆动模式和涡轮-调速器模式的阻尼，进一步降低虚拟惯性常数可获得更好的阻尼效果。

Conclusion: 当前行业模仿同步发电机高惯性、大下垂的控制策略可能限制了逆变器资源的潜力，最优稳定性和性能应通过低下垂和低虚拟惯性实现，这能产生紧密有界的频率变化和强阻尼的机电模式，需要重新评估电网形成换流器的控制设计原则和电网规范要求。

Abstract: This paper employs modal analysis to study the core inertial dynamics of governor-controlled synchronous generators (GC-SG), droop-based grid-forming (GFM) converters, and their most fundamental interactions. The results indicate that even in the simplest cases, the prevailing industry paradigm of emulating legacy GC-SG behaviour in GFM converters (high inertia to slow down the system and large droop to increase damping) could be a suboptimal policy. It is shown that GC-SGs exhibit a fundamental trade-off: adequate damping of the turbine-governor mode requires large droop constants, inevitably increasing steady-state frequency deviation and dependence on secondary regulation. In contrast, droop-based GFM converters invert this relationship: decreasing the droop constant simultaneously reduces steady-state frequency deviations and increases damping, while allowing virtual inertia to be freely chosen. When two GC-SGs are coupled, the poorly damped electromechanical swing mode emerges. Results show that replacing one GC-SG with a GFM converter of equivalent droop and inertia already significantly improves damping of both swing and turbine-governor modes. Counter-intuitively, further and remarkable damping gains are achieved by substantially lowering the GFM virtual inertia constant. These findings suggest that current industry trends may be constraining the potential benefits of Inverter Based Resources (IBRs). Optimal stability and performance are instead obtained with low droop and low virtual inertia, yielding tightly bounded frequency variations and strongly-damped electromechanical modes. The results indicate a need to re-evaluate GFM control design principles and emerging grid-code requirements.

Abstract: This paper presents a Gain-Scheduled Data-Enabled Predictive Control (GS-DeePC) framework for nonlinear systems based on multiple locally linear data representations. Instead of relying on a single global Hankel matrix, the operating range of a measurable scheduling variable is partitioned into regions, and regional Hankel matrices are constructed from persistently exciting data. To ensure smooth transitions between linearization regions and suppress region-induced chattering, composite regions are introduced, merging neighboring data sets and enabling a robust switching mechanism. The proposed method maintains the original DeePC problem structure and can achieve reduced computational complexity by requiring only short, locally informative data sequences. Extensive experiments on a nonlinear DC-motor with an unbalanced disc demonstrate the significantly improved control performance compared to standard DeePC.

Abstract: Stochastic Nonlinear Optimal Control (SNOC) seeks to minimize a cost function that accounts for random disturbances acting on a nonlinear dynamical system. Since the expectation over all disturbances is generally intractable, a common surrogate is the empirical cost, obtained by averaging over a finite dataset of sampled noise realizations. This substitution, however, introduces the challenge of guaranteeing performance under unseen disturbances. The issue is particularly severe when the dataset is limited, as the trained controllers may overfit, leading to substantial gaps between their empirical cost and the deployment cost. In this work, we develop a PAC-Bayesian framework that establishes rigorous generalization bounds for SNOC. Building on these bounds, we propose a principled controller design method that balances empirical performance and prior knowledge. To ensure tractability, we derive computationally efficient relaxations of the bounds and employ approximate inference methods. Our framework further leverages expressive neural controller parameterizations, guaranteeing closed-loop stability. Through simulated examples, we highlight how prior knowledge can be incorporated into control design and how more reliable controllers can be synthesized for cooperative robotics.

Abstract: Reachability analysis has been a prominent way to provide safety guarantees for neurally controlled autonomous systems, but its direct application to neural perception components is infeasible due to imperfect or intractable perception models. Typically, this issue has been bypassed by complementing reachability with statistical analysis of perception error, say with conformal prediction (CP). However, existing CP methods for time-series data often provide conservative bounds. The corresponding error accumulation over time has made it challenging to combine statistical bounds with symbolic reachability in a way that is provable, scalable, and minimally conservative. To reduce conservatism and improve scalability, our key insight is that perception error varies significantly with the system's dynamical state. This article proposes state-dependent conformal prediction, which exploits that dependency in constructing tight high-confidence bounds on perception error. Based on this idea, we provide an approach to partition the state space, using a genetic algorithm, so as to optimize the tightness of conformal bounds. Finally, since using these bounds in reachability analysis leads to additional uncertainty and branching in the resulting hybrid system, we propose a branch-merging reachability algorithm that trades off uncertainty for scalability so as to enable scalable and tight verification. The evaluation of our verification methodology on two complementary case studies demonstrates reduced conservatism compared to the state of the art.

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) applications are often hindered by various sources of error, with multipath interference being one of the most challenging, particularly in urban environments. In this work, we build on previous research by implementing a GNSS array-based multipath detection algorithm, incorporating real-time attitude estimation for dynamic scenarios. The method fuses GNSS and IMU data using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) on a manifold, enabling continuous attitude tracking. The proposed approach utilizes attitude information from satellite combinations to identify and exclude multipath-affected satellites, improving the accuracy of both positioning and attitude determination. To address computational challenges associated with evaluating large numbers of satellite combinations, we propose the use of the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, which reduces the number of combinations assessed while maintaining high detection performance. Performance evaluations are conducted using trajectories and IMU readings from the KITTI dataset. GNSS observations are simulated based on ground truth positions and satellite ephemeris. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting satellites affected by multipath interference. Significant improvements in positioning accuracy are observed, particularly in scenarios where a large portion of the visible satellites are contaminated by severe multipath.

Result: 与不同基于学习的建模方法进行比较分析，显示所提解决方案在模拟和实验系统中均显著改善了学习模型的物理一致性。在实验基准上成功应用了反馈线性化和基于能量的控制技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效提高了拉格朗日系统模型的物理一致性，为基于模型的非线性控制提供了实用解决方案，特别是在数据有限、不完整且有噪声的实际物理系统中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: This article investigates the modeling and control of Lagrangian systems involving non-conservative forces using a hybrid method that does not require acceleration calculations. It focuses in particular on the derivation and identification of physically consistent models, which are essential for model-based control synthesis. Lagrangian or Hamiltonian neural networks provide useful structural guarantees but the learning of such models often leads to inconsistent models, especially on real physical systems where training data are limited, partial and noisy. Motivated by this observation and the objective to exploit these models for model-based nonlinear control, a learning algorithm relying on an original loss function is proposed to improve the physical consistency of Lagrangian systems. A comparative analysis of different learning-based modeling approaches with the proposed solution shows significant improvements in terms of physical consistency of the learned models, on both simulated and experimental systems. The model's consistency is then exploited to demonstrate, on an experimental benchmark, the practical relevance of the proposed methodology for feedback linearization and energy-based control techniques.

### [68] [The Three-Dimensional Decomposition of Volatility Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02166)
*Ziyao Wang,A. Alexandre Trindade,Svetlozar T. Rachev*

Main category: q-fin.MF

TL;DR: 提出三维波动率记忆分解框架，将记忆分解为水平、形状和节奏三个正交分量，统一了机制转换、分数积分和业务时间方法，为波动率动态提供了统一的理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有波动率建模方法（如GARCH、机制转换、分数积分等）各自为政，缺乏统一的理论框架来解释波动率记忆的不同维度。需要建立一个综合框架来理解波动率记忆如何通过水平、形状和节奏三个维度演化。

Method: 开发三维正交分解框架，将波动率记忆分解为水平、形状和节奏分量。建立该分解的存在性、唯一性和遍历性条件，证明所有GARCH类过程都是特例。应用统一的三门模型实证分析SPY和EURUSD数据。

Result: 波动率记忆具有状态依赖性：股票市场（SPY）中机制门和节奏门占主导，而外汇市场（EURUSD）中分数记忆门更显著。统一的三门模型能同时捕捉这些效应，为波动率动态提供了更全面的解释。

Conclusion: 通过水平-形状-节奏结构形式化波动率动态，为信息流、市场活动和金融波动率演化记忆之间建立了连贯联系。该框架统一了多种波动率建模方法，为理解波动率记忆的多维性质提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This paper develops a three-dimensional decomposition of volatility memory into orthogonal components of level, shape, and tempo. The framework unifies regime-switching, fractional-integration, and business-time approaches within a single canonical representation that identifies how each dimension governs persistence strength, long-memory form, and temporal speed. We establish conditions for existence, uniqueness, and ergodicity of this decomposition and show that all GARCH-type processes arise as special cases. Empirically, applications to SPY and EURUSD (2005--2024) reveal that volatility memory is state-dependent: regime and tempo gates dominate in equities, while fractional-memory gates prevail in foreign exchange. The unified tri-gate model jointly captures these effects. By formalizing volatility dynamics through a level--shape--tempo structure, the paper provides a coherent link between information flow, market activity, and the evolving memory of financial volatility.

### [69] [The 4/$δ$ Bound: Designing Predictable LLM-Verifier Systems for Formal Method Guarantee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02080)
*PIerre Dantas,Lucas Cordeiro,Youcheng Sun,Waldir Junior*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个LLM-验证器收敛定理，为LLM辅助的形式验证提供了理论保证，证明了只要错误减少概率δ>0，验证过程几乎必然收敛，且期望迭代次数有界于4/δ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM与形式验证工具结合的方法缺乏理论基础，导致验证过程不可靠、不稳定，有时收敛、有时循环、有时偏离稳定轨迹，需要建立理论框架来保证终止性和收敛性。

Method: 将LLM与验证器的交互建模为离散时间马尔可夫链，状态转移由关键参数错误减少概率δ决定，并推导出LLM-验证器收敛定理。通过超过90,000次试验进行大规模实证验证。

Result: 理论证明：对于任何δ>0，过程几乎必然达到验证状态，期望迭代次数E[n]≤4/δ。实证结果完全符合理论预测：所有运行都达到验证，收敛因子Cf≈1.0，验证了理论边界的实际有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLM辅助验证建立了坚实的理论基础和实证支持，定义了三个操作区域（边际、实用、高性能），提供了可预测的资源规划和性能预算框架，特别适用于安全关键软件环境。

Abstract: The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程图是常用的流程沟通工具，但通常以静态图像形式分享，难以编辑和重用。现有工具缺乏结构化、版本可控的文本表示

Method: 使用详细系统提示和视觉语言模型将流程图图像转换为Mermaid.js代码，提供混合主动式编辑界面（内联文本编辑、拖放节点插入、自然语言命令），集成AI助手

Result: 开发了一个轻量级Web系统，能够生成结构化、版本可控的文本表示，并与渲染的图表保持同步。引入了评估指标来评估多个模型的结构准确性、流程正确性、语法有效性和完整性

Conclusion: 该方法能够将静态流程图转换为可编辑的Mermaid.js代码，支持灵活的编辑方式，相比现有图像到图表工具具有更好的结构化和版本控制能力

Abstract: Flowcharts are common tools for communicating processes but are often shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused. We present \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid}, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.

*Alexander Boyd,Franz Nowak,David Hyland,Manuel Baltieri,Fernando E. Rosas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于转换器分解的框架，将复杂世界模型分解为可并行处理的子转换器，提高计算效率并增强可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界模型通常计算需求高，但真实场景往往包含模块化交互的子组件。为了在AI安全所需的透明性和实际推理所需的计算效率之间架起桥梁，需要开发可分解、可并行处理的世界模型框架。

Method: 开发了一个基于转换器（transducers）的分解框架，将复杂世界模型表示为转换器（POMDP的泛化），然后将其分解为在独立输入输出子空间上运行的子转换器，支持分布式推理。

Result: 建立了将复杂转换器分解为可并行处理子转换器的理论基础，提供了比单一世界模型更高效、更可解释的替代方案，支持分布式推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为连接AI安全所需的结构透明性和实际推理所需的计算效率奠定了基础，为可分解、可并行处理的世界模型提供了理论支持。

Abstract: World models have been recently proposed as sandbox environments in which AI agents can be trained and evaluated before deployment. Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.

*Shubhi Asthana,Bing Zhang,Chad DeLuca,Ruchi Mahindru,Hima Patel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STRIDE框架通过系统评估任务特性，为AI部署提供三种模式（直接LLM调用、引导式助手、全自主智能体）的选择建议，避免不必要的智能体部署，降低成本风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI从无状态大语言模型向自主智能体的快速转变，需要解决一个核心问题：何时真正需要智能体AI？不加区分地部署智能体会导致成本增加、复杂性提高和风险上升。

Method: 提出STRIDE框架，集成结构化任务分解、动态性归因和自我反思需求分析，生成智能体适用性评分，确保全自主智能体仅用于具有固有动态性或演化上下文的任务。

Result: 在30个真实世界任务中，STRIDE在模式选择上达到92%准确率，减少45%不必要的智能体部署，降低37%资源成本。专家验证确认其实际效用。

Conclusion: 该工作将智能体采用重新定义为需求驱动的设计决策，确保自主性仅在收益证明成本合理时应用，避免过度工程化。

Abstract: The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.
  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.
  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.

### [73] [Benchmarking LLM Agents for Wealth-Management Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02230)
*Rory Milsom*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文扩展TheAgentCompany平台，构建财富管理环境，研究通用LLM代理能否准确经济地完成财富管理任务，发现代理主要受端到端工作流可靠性限制而非数学推理，且自主性水平显著影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现代工作依赖各种数字协作工具，但日常流程仍受人为错误和延迟困扰。该研究旨在填补这一空白，探索通用LLM代理在财富管理任务中的表现，评估其作为助理级财富管理工作的适用性。

Method: 扩展TheAgentCompany平台，构建金融专注环境；引入合成领域数据，丰富同事模拟，原型化自动任务生成管道；构建包含12个任务对的财富管理助理基准测试，涵盖检索、分析和综合/沟通任务，设置明确验收标准和确定性评分器；创建新的金融特定数据集，并为每个任务设计高自主性和低自主性变体。

Result: 研究发现：1）代理的限制更多来自端到端工作流可靠性而非数学推理能力；2）自主性水平对代理性能有显著影响；3）不正确的模型评估方法阻碍了基准测试的有效性。

Conclusion: 通用LLM代理在财富管理任务中面临的主要挑战是工作流可靠性问题，而非数学推理能力。自主性水平是影响代理性能的关键因素，需要改进评估方法以更准确衡量代理在财富管理工作中的适用性。

Abstract: Modern work relies on an assortment of digital collaboration tools, yet routine processes continue to suffer from human error and delay. To address this gap, this dissertation extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment and investigates whether a general purpose LLM agent can complete representative wealth-management tasks both accurately and economically. This study introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. The study aims to create and assess an evaluation set that can meaningfully measure an agent's fitness for assistant-level wealth management work. We construct a benchmark of 12 task-pairs for wealth management assistants spanning retrieval, analysis, and synthesis/communication, with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders. We seeded a set of new finance-specific data and introduced a high vs. low-autonomy variant of every task. The paper concluded that agents are limited less by mathematical reasoning and more so by end-to-end workflow reliability, and meaningfully affected by autonomy level, and that incorrect evaluation of models have hindered benchmarking.

TL;DR: TradeTrap是一个统一的评估框架，用于系统性地压力测试自适应和程序化自主交易代理，揭示它们在系统级扰动下的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的交易代理在真实金融市场中部署越来越多，但在对抗性或故障条件下的可靠性和鲁棒性尚未得到充分检验，而金融环境具有高风险和不可逆的特点。

Method: TradeTrap框架针对自主交易代理的四个核心组件（市场情报、策略制定、投资组合和账本处理、交易执行）进行系统级扰动测试，在真实美股市场数据的闭环历史回测环境中进行公平可复现的比较。

Result: 实验表明，单个组件的小扰动可以通过代理决策循环传播，导致极端集中、失控敞口和大幅投资组合回撤，证明当前自主交易代理在系统层面易被误导。

Conclusion: 当前自主交易代理在系统层面存在脆弱性，需要更鲁棒的设计和评估方法，TradeTrap为系统化测试提供了统一框架。

Abstract: LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real-world financial markets to perform autonomous analysis and execution. However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yanlewen/TradeTrap.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前AI系统在自我监控、元认知、自适应学习等方面存在七大核心缺陷，主张向基于认知科学的AI（认知自主性）范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在感知、语言、推理和多模态领域取得快速进展，但现代AI系统在自我监控、自我校正和动态环境中的自主行为调节方面仍存在根本性限制。论文旨在识别和分析这些限制，并提出超越这些限制的前瞻性视角。

Method: 通过比较分析人工系统与生物认知，整合AI研究、认知科学和神经科学的见解，识别出七大核心缺陷：缺乏内在自我监控、缺乏元认知意识、固定和非自适应学习机制、无法重构目标、缺乏表征维护、不足的具身反馈、缺乏内在能动性。

Result: 论文指出当前架构（包括深度学习和基于transformer的系统）的结构性限制阻碍了它们实现鲁棒泛化、终身适应性和现实世界自主性。单纯扩展规模无法解决这些问题。

Conclusion: 主张向基于认知科学的AI（认知自主性）进行范式转变，这种AI能够实现自我导向的适应、动态表征管理和有意图的目标导向行为，同时配备改革性监督机制，确保自主系统保持可解释性、可治理性并与人类价值观对齐。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在心理健康、危机干预等敏感服务中广泛应用，但其心理社会安全性评估不足，缺乏系统化的评估框架。

Method: 提出DialogGuard多智能体框架，包含四种LLM-as-a-judge评估流程：单智能体评分、双智能体修正、多智能体辩论和随机多数投票，基于共享的三级评估标准。

Result: 多智能体机制比非LLM基线和单智能体评估更准确；双智能体修正和多数投票在准确性、与人类评分对齐和鲁棒性方面达到最佳平衡；辩论方法召回率更高但会过度标记边界案例。

Conclusion: DialogGuard作为开源软件发布，提供可解释的风险评分和理由，支持面向脆弱用户的网络应用进行提示设计、审计和监督。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now mediate many web-based mental-health, crisis, and other emotionally sensitive services, yet their psychosocial safety in these settings remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated. We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discriminatory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog-Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language rationales. A formative study with 12 practitioners illustrates how it supports prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable users.

Motivation: 模型恢复（MR）对于关键任务自主系统的安全可解释决策很重要，但现有基于神经ODE的方法在FPGA上效率低下，内存和能耗是边缘设备实时操作的主要瓶颈。

Method: 提出MERINDA框架，用可并行化的神经架构替代神经ODE中的迭代求解器，专门针对FPGA优化，降低内存使用并提高运行效率。

Result: 相比移动GPU，MERINDA实现近11倍DRAM使用降低和2.2倍运行速度提升，实验显示在固定精度下内存与能耗呈反比关系。

Conclusion: MERINDA适合资源受限的实时关键任务自主系统，在边缘设备上实现了高效、低内存消耗的模型恢复。

Abstract: Model Recovery (MR) enables safe, explainable decision making in mission-critical autonomous systems (MCAS) by learning governing dynamical equations, but its deployment on edge devices is hindered by the iterative nature of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which are inefficient on FPGAs. Memory and energy consumption are the main concerns when applying MR on edge devices for real-time operation. We propose MERINDA, a novel FPGA-accelerated MR framework that replaces iterative solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs. MERINDA achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs. Experiments reveal an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy, highlighting MERINDA's suitability for resource-constrained, real-time MCAS.

Conclusion: 该框架在有限标注数据下实现了突破性性能，显著减少医学专家创建数据集所需时间，解决了临床感知AI发展的根本瓶颈。量子启发边缘增强和复杂度加权采样策略对处理医学图像分割中的严重类别不平衡问题特别有效。

Abstract: Annotating medical images demands significant time and expertise, often requiring pathologists to invest hundreds of hours in labeling mammary epithelial nuclei datasets. We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development.

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在多视角设置中难以保持几何一致性和跨视角一致性，缺乏能够隔离多视角推理与单视角感知和时间因素的细粒度基准测试。

Method: 构建ReMindView-Bench基准测试，系统性地变化视角空间模式和查询类型来探测空间认知关键因素。使用显性分析（LLM作为评判和自一致性提示）和隐性分析（线性探测和熵动态）来诊断推理过程。

Result: 评估15个当前VLM显示在跨视角对齐和视角转换方面存在一致失败。模型在帧内感知表现良好，但在跨视角信息整合时性能急剧下降。隐性分析显示任务相关信息逐渐丢失，正确与错误轨迹之间的不确定性分离。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的生成式智能体MMO模拟系统，通过SFT和RL训练LLMs模拟真实玩家行为，结合数据驱动的环境模型，为数值设计优化提供可靠、可解释、低成本的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MMO游戏数值系统和机制设计优化方法依赖大规模在线实验或预定义统计模型参数调优，成本高、耗时长且可能干扰玩家体验。简化离线模拟系统保真度有限，无法准确模拟真实玩家的推理和对干预的反应。

Method: 1. 基于大语言模型的生成式智能体模拟系统；2. 在大规模真实玩家行为数据上应用监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)，将LLMs从通用先验适配到游戏特定领域；3. 基于真实游戏日志训练数据驱动的环境模型，重建动态游戏系统。

Result: 实验表明系统与真实世界玩家行为具有强一致性，在干预下产生合理的因果响应，为数据驱动的数值设计优化提供了可靠、可解释且成本高效的框架。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的生成式智能体MMO模拟系统能够有效解决传统优化方法的局限性，通过高保真模拟真实玩家决策，为游戏数值设计提供了一种创新的数据驱动优化方案。

Abstract: Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探索使用监督学习结合合成错误注入来诱导语言模型自我纠正能力，但发现该方法效果有限，无法显著提升性能，且模型即使发现错误也常重复原错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习已成为激发大语言模型推理和自我纠正能力的主要方法，但其计算成本高昂，因此需要探索替代方案。受自动驾驶和机器人技术启发，研究是否可以通过监督学习结合合成错误注入来诱导语言模型的自我纠正能力。

Method: 在推理链中插入人工错误，将其掩盖，然后监督模型识别和纠正这些错误。通过合成错误注入的方式进行监督学习训练。

Result: 该方法即使在简单的合成任务上也无法显著提升多个模型的性能。即使模型发现了自己的错误，也常常只是重复原始错误。研究发现，从合成错误到策略错误的分布偏移会显著降低微调模型的错误纠正能力，即使合成错误覆盖了策略错误。

Conclusion: 研究结果解释了为什么策略强化学习方法在激发自我纠正能力方面被证明是独特有效的，而基于合成错误注入的监督学习方法效果有限。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测市场存在碎片化问题，包括重叠问题、隐含等价关系和隐藏矛盾，需要自动化方法来发现市场间的语义结构和依赖关系。

Method: 使用基于自然语言理解的AI代理管道：(1) 根据合约文本和元数据将市场聚类到连贯的主题组；(2) 识别组内市场对之间的强依赖关系，包括相同结果（正相关）和不同结果（负相关）的关系。

Result: 在Polymarket历史数据集上评估，AI识别的关系准确率达到60-70%，基于这些关系构建的简单交易策略在周度时间范围内获得约20%的平均收益。

Conclusion: 代理AI和大语言模型能够有效发现预测市场中潜在的语义结构，识别出的市场关系具有实际交易价值，为市场分析和交易策略提供了新方法。

Abstract: Prediction markets allow users to trade on outcomes of real-world events, but are prone to fragmentation through overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across markets. We present an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously (i) clusters markets into coherent topical groups using natural-language understanding over contract text and metadata, and (ii) identifies within-cluster market pairs whose resolved outcomes exhibit strong dependence, including same-outcome (correlated) and different-outcome (anti-correlated) relationships. Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.

TL;DR: R-Few是一个引导式自我对弈框架，通过少量人类标注示例指导合成问题生成，结合课程学习实现稳定可控的AI自我进化，在数学和通用推理任务上取得持续改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI自我进化系统存在概念漂移、多样性崩溃和错误进化等问题，导致模型在训练过程中停滞甚至退化。需要一种能够稳定、可控地进行自我进化，同时最小化对人类监督依赖的方法。

Method: 提出R-Few框架，包含挑战者-解决者两个组件：挑战者使用少量人类标注示例指导合成问题生成；解决者结合人类和合成示例进行在线、基于难度的课程学习训练。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中，R-Few实现了持续迭代改进。Qwen3-8B-Base在数学任务上比R-Zero提高3.0分，性能与使用20倍人类数据训练的General-Reasoner相当。

Conclusion: R-Few通过接地气的挑战者训练和课程式解决者训练的互补贡献，缓解了概念漂移问题，产生了更稳定可控的协同进化动态，为AI自我进化提供了有效框架。

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

TL;DR: COPE是一个基于链式思维推理的大语言模型框架，用于从非结构化临床笔记预测急性缺血性卒中90天功能结局，性能与GPT-4.1相当，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含丰富的上下文信息，但其非结构化特性限制了在传统预测模型中的应用。需要开发能够利用这些非结构化数据准确预测卒中结局的方法。

Method: 开发了链式思维结局预测引擎（COPE），基于开源LLaMA-3-8B模型的两步推理框架：第一步生成临床推理，第二步输出mRS预测。比较了GPT-4.1、ClinicalBERT、结构化变量机器学习模型和单步LLM。

Result: COPE的MAE为1.01，±1准确率为74.4%，精确准确率为32.8%，性能与GPT-4.1相当，优于ClinicalBERT、临床ML和单步LLM。在性别和年龄亚组中表现一致，在老年患者、接受血栓切除术患者和较长摘要患者中误差略高。

Conclusion: COPE作为一个轻量级、可解释且保护隐私的开源框架，为从非结构化临床文本进行结局预测提供了准确实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.

Abstract: The exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety. Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.

Method: 1. 多模态共情预测：使用预训练网络提取视频、音频和文本特征，进行跨模态融合得到多模态特征表示，用于预测共情标签；2. 监督文档辅助训练：在训练阶段引入监督文档作为特权信息，使用LDA模型识别潜在主题分布来约束文本特征

Conclusion: 提出的多模态共情预测方法有效整合了多种模态信息，并通过监督文档辅助训练提升了性能，展示了多模态方法和特权信息利用在共情预测中的价值

Abstract: Prevalent empathy prediction techniques primarily concentrate on a singular modality, typically textual, thus neglecting multi-modal processing capabilities. They also overlook the utilization of certain privileged information, which may encompass additional empathetic content. In response, we introduce an advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method integrating video, audio, and text information. The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy. Notably, this privileged information is only available during training and is not accessible during the prediction phase. Experimental results on the multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets demonstrate that our approach is superior to the existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

Motivation: 传统静态、硬编码的代理工作流存在局限性，需要预定义图或专门编程，无法灵活适应开放任务，且单向函数调用容易导致错误传播。

Method: IACT采用纯用户对话驱动的通用自主系统，根据高级目标自主构建动态递归代理拓扑，用双向状态化对话替代刚性调用，实现交互冗余和运行时纠错。

Result: 该模型已在kragent.ai系统中生产部署，通过真实工作流的定性证据展示了其有效性，而非依赖详尽基准测试结果。

Conclusion: IACT通过动态代理拓扑和交互冗余机制，为开放任务提供了可扩展的自主系统解决方案，克服了传统工作流的僵化性和错误传播问题。

Abstract: This technical white paper introduces the Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT), a computational model designed to address the limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows. Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动的RUL预测方法通常假设训练和测试数据来自相同分布，但实际工业环境中存在领域差异问题。先前对抗领域自适应方法专注于提取领域不变特征，但忽略了目标特定信息和退化阶段的一致性特征，导致性能不佳。

Conclusion: TACDA方法有效解决了跨域RUL预测中的领域差异问题，通过同时考虑领域不变特征、目标特定信息和退化阶段一致性，实现了更准确的剩余使用寿命预测。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in machinery can significantly diminish maintenance costs, enhance equipment up-time, and mitigate adverse outcomes. Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法能够学习一个通用的多任务策略，能够遵循任意LTL指令，特别是在多个高级事件同时发生且复杂交互的环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a compelling framework for specifying complex, structured tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现标准Transformer模型在递归深度泛化方面存在局限，提出了一种循环定位替换管道方法来解决嵌套层次结构的推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在许多任务上表现出色，但在处理需要解决嵌套层次结构的递归推理问题时面临挑战。现有研究主要关注长度泛化（处理比训练时更长的序列），而深度泛化（处理比训练时更深嵌套层次的能力）尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出一种新颖的循环定位替换管道方法，将递归问题分解为可管理的子组件。该方法使用两个专门模型：定位器识别可解的子表达式，替换器评估这些组件同时保持整体结构。

Result: 在布尔代数、递归算术和命题逻辑三个精心设计的领域中评估该方法，每个领域都有可控的递归深度。实验表明，该方法在测试超出分布范围的递归深度时，有效缓解了性能衰减问题。

Conclusion: 标准Transformer架构在处理比训练时更深的递归问题时存在局限，这源于其无法维持类似栈的行为来跟踪和解决多级嵌套依赖。提出的循环定位替换管道方法为解决这一深度泛化挑战提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.

Abstract: As generative models become powerful, concerns around transparency, accountability, and copyright violations have intensified. Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.

TL;DR: Menta是一个专门为社交媒体心理健康预测优化的轻量级小语言模型，通过多任务联合训练在抑郁、压力和自杀倾向等任务上表现优于现有SLM和部分LLM，并能在移动设备上实时部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康问题影响全球数亿人，但早期检测仍然有限。虽然大语言模型在心理健康应用中有潜力，但其规模和计算需求阻碍了实际部署。小语言模型提供了轻量级替代方案，但在基于社交媒体的心理健康预测方面尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入Menta模型，采用基于LoRA的框架进行多任务联合训练，使用跨数据集策略和平衡准确率导向的损失函数，专门针对社交媒体数据进行六个分类任务的优化。

Result: Menta在抑郁、压力和自杀倾向等任务上比最佳非微调SLM平均提升15.2%，在抑郁和压力分类任务上比130亿参数LLM准确率更高，同时模型大小约为其1/3.25。能在iPhone 15 Pro Max上实时部署，仅需约3GB内存。

Conclusion: Menta展示了轻量级模型在心理健康监测中的潜力，为可扩展、隐私保护的实时心理健康监控提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Mental health conditions affect hundreds of millions globally, yet early detection remains limited. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

TL;DR: StockMem：一个事件-反思双层记忆框架，通过结构化新闻事件和追踪事件演化来预测股价，优于现有记忆架构并提供可解释的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股价预测面临市场波动性和对实时事件敏感性的挑战。虽然大语言模型为基于文本的预测提供了新途径，但在金融领域的应用受到噪声新闻数据和文本中缺乏明确答案的限制。通用记忆架构难以识别价格变动的关键驱动因素。

Method: 提出StockMem，一个事件-反思双层记忆框架。它将新闻结构化到事件中，并从两个维度进行挖掘：横向整合整合每日事件，纵向追踪捕捉事件演化以提取反映市场预期差异的增量信息。这构建了一个时序事件知识库。通过分析事件-价格动态，框架进一步形成因果经验的反思知识库。在预测时，它检索类似的历史场景，并结合当前事件、增量数据和过去经验进行推理。

Result: 实验表明StockMem优于现有的记忆架构，并通过追踪影响价格的信息链提供更优、可解释的推理，增强了金融预测中的决策透明度。

Conclusion: StockMem通过结构化事件处理和双层记忆框架，有效解决了金融新闻数据噪声和缺乏明确答案的问题，为股价预测提供了更准确和可解释的方法。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

Conclusion: LLMs展示了AI增强审计的潜力，人类审计师与基础模型协作可以加强财务完整性

Abstract: Auditors rely on Journal Entry Tests (JETs) to detect anomalies in tax-related ledger records, but rule-based methods generate overwhelming false positives and struggle with subtle irregularities. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as anomaly detectors in double-entry bookkeeping. Benchmarking SoTA LLMs such as LLaMA and Gemma on both synthetic and real-world anonymized ledgers, we compare them against JETs and machine learning baselines. Our results show that LLMs consistently outperform traditional rule-based JETs and classical ML baselines, while also providing natural-language explanations that enhance interpretability. These results highlight the potential of \textbf{AI-augmented auditing}, where human auditors collaborate with foundation models to strengthen financial integrity.

Conclusion: 建立了动力系统视角下的自改进理论框架，为理解各种自改进架构提供了统一的数学基础，方差不等式为设计稳定自改进系统提供了指导原则

Abstract: We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.
  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.
  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.

Abstract: This work presents a conceptual framework for causal concept-based post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), based on the requirements that explanations for non-interpretable models should be understandable as well as faithful to the model being explained. Local and global explanations are generated by calculating the probability of sufficiency of concept interventions. Example explanations are presented, generated with a proof-of-concept model made to explain classifiers trained on the CelebA dataset. Understandability is demonstrated through a clear concept-based vocabulary, subject to an implicit causal interpretation. Fidelity is addressed by highlighting important framework assumptions, stressing that the context of explanation interpretation must align with the context of explanation generation.

Conclusion: 提出的无需提示协作代理框架有效解决了现有论文到代码生成系统的局限性，通过自动验证和精炼机制显著提升了复现代码的质量，为自动化科学复现提供了更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated paper reproduction has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate scientific research, employing multi-step workflow frameworks to systematically convert academic papers into executable code. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\% and 13\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents. Furthermore, comparative experiments against Self-Refine validate the robustness and consistency of our prompt-free approach across different datasets.

Conclusion: Radiologist Copilot通过模拟放射科医生的完整工作流程，实现了自动化放射学报告生成与质量控制，能够有效辅助放射科医生并提高临床效率。

Abstract: Radiology reporting is an essential yet time-consuming and error-prone task for radiologists in clinical examinations, especially for volumetric medical images. Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 鞅分数作为无监督指标，即使在无真实标签领域也能有效评估推理过程的求真能力，揭示了LLM推理中存在的系统性信念固着问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

Conclusion: 侵入式上下文工程为LLM长上下文安全提供了有效的补充方案，不依赖训练数据，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Current research on operator control of Large Language Models improves model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on preference examples, prompting, and input/output filtering. Despite good results, LLMs remain susceptible to abuse, and jailbreak probability increases with context length. There is a need for robust LLM security guarantees in long-context situations. We propose control sentences inserted into the LLM context as invasive context engineering to partially solve the problem. We suggest this technique can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming. Invasive Context Engineering does not rely on LLM training, avoiding data shortage pitfalls which arise in training models for long context situations.

Conclusion: 当前LLMs作为新兴的在线社交调解代理既有前景也有局限性，需要进一步研究来提升其调解能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有覆盖控制算法通常假设静态密度函数或需要集中式计算，难以处理时变密度函数的动态覆盖问题，且分布式实现通常需要复杂的通信结构。

Method: 基于奇异摄动理论，采用两时间尺度分离方法：快速时间尺度对应通信，慢速时间尺度对应机器人运动。算法在2跳Delaunay图上分布式运行，并提出了三种仅需1跳通信的离散时间版本，但需使用延迟信息。

Result: 当摄动参数足够小时，分布式算法能达到与集中式算法相同的性能。三种离散时间版本仅需1跳通信，并正式建立了它们的渐近收敛性。仿真验证了算法的性能。

Conclusion: 该算法成功解决了时变密度函数的动态覆盖控制问题，通过时间尺度分离实现了分布式计算，在通信受限情况下仍能保持良好性能，为机器人群体覆盖控制提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic coverage control algorithm allowing a group of robots to track an optimal-deployment configuration for arbitrary time-varying density functions. Building on singular perturbation theory, the proposed design employs a two-time scale separation approach, with a fast time scale corresponding to communication and a slow time scale corresponding to agent motion. The resulting algorithm is distributed over the 2-hop Delaunay graph and, for small enough values of the perturbation parameter, achieves the same performance as its centralized counterpart. We also introduce three discrete-time versions that rely only on 1-hop communication at the cost of having to use delayed information and formally establish their asymptotic convergence properties. Our technical approach combines computational geometry, singular perturbation theory, generating functions, and linear iterations with delayed updates. Various simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

Conclusion: SPS_safe为随机次梯度方法提供了一种无需强假设的随机Polyak步长变体，在非光滑凸优化中具有严格的收敛保证，并在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The stochastic Polyak step size (SPS) has proven to be a promising choice for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), delivering competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods on smooth convex and non-convex optimization problems, including deep neural network training. However, extensions of this approach to non-smooth settings remain in their early stages, often relying on interpolation assumptions or requiring knowledge of the optimal solution. In this work, we propose a novel SPS variant, Safeguarded SPS (SPS$_{safe}$), for the stochastic subgradient method, and provide rigorous convergence guarantees for non-smooth convex optimization with no need for strong assumptions. We further incorporate momentum into the update rule, yielding equally tight theoretical results. Comprehensive experiments on convex benchmarks and deep neural networks corroborate our theory: the proposed step size accelerates convergence, reduces variance, and consistently outperforms existing adaptive baselines. Finally, in the context of deep neural network training, our method demonstrates robust performance by addressing the vanishing gradient problem.

Method: 提出参数高效子空间优化（PESO）框架，基于子空间最小化理论，统一现有方法。具体实例化为PESO-LoRA算法，使用LoRA类型参数化，在子空间中进行探索-利用优化。

Result: PESO框架建立了完整参数空间的收敛保证，解决了LoRA变体缺乏理论保证的问题。PESO-LoRA在标准基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PESO框架为参数高效微调提供了统一的理论基础，连接了实践方法与优化理论，同时实现了内存效率和强收敛性能的平衡。

Abstract: This paper develops a new perspective on parameter-efficient fine-tuning for LLMs, inspired by the classical theory of subspace minimization. We introduce a unifying framework, Parameter-Efficient Subspace Optimization (PESO), which not only recovers many existing methods such as LoRA but also bridges them with the principled algorithmic and theoretical foundations of subspace optimization. This connection highlights a natural ``exploration--exploitation'' view of subspace methods, guiding the design of new algorithms that achieve strong convergence performance while still preserving memory efficiency. Importantly, our framework establishes the convergence in the full-parameter space, resolving a critical gap of LoRA variants where low-rank updates lack such guarantees. We further instantiate the framework into a practical algorithm named {PESO-LoRA}, based on LoRA-type parameterization. Our algorithm achieves notable improvements over existing methods on standard benchmarks.

*Moddassir Khan Nayeem,Omar Abbaas,Suzan Alaswad,Sinan Salman*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出基于Lambert W函数的精确定价算法，在logit需求函数下解析推导收益最大化价格，纠正传统拐点定价的误区，实现消费者降价20%同时卖家增收15%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性、幂函数、指数需求函数虽便于分析但无法捕捉真实购买动态，导致次优定价。logit需求函数通过有界S形曲线更真实反映消费者行为，但现有文献多依赖启发式方法（如拐点定价），虽关注价格敏感性最大化却无法保证收益最大化

Method: 提出新颖的精确定价算法，利用Lambert W函数在logit需求函数下解析推导收益最大化价格，提供闭式解，消除对启发式迭代方法的依赖

Result: 最优价格始终低于拐点价格（在合理假设下），数值实验显示平均降价20%同时收益增加15%，最优性差距随需求函数参数变化而变化

Conclusion: 通过Lambert W函数提供logit需求下的精确收益最大化定价方案，纠正拐点定价误区，实现买卖双方共赢：消费者享受更低价格，卖家获得更高收益

Abstract: Determining the optimal selling price is a challenge in revenue management, especially in markets characterized by nonlinear and price-sensitive demand. While traditional models, such as linear, power, and exponential demand functions, offer analytical convenience, they often fail to capture realistic purchase dynamics, leading to suboptimal pricing. The logit demand function addresses these limitations through its bounded, S-shaped curve, offering a more realistic representation of consumer behavior. Despite its advantages, most existing literature relies on heuristic approaches, such as pricing at the inflection point, which prioritizes maximum price sensitivity but does not guarantee maximum revenue. This study proposes a novel, exact pricing algorithm that analytically derives the revenue-maximizing price under the logit demand function using the Lambert W function. By providing a closed-form solution, the approach eliminates reliance on heuristic iterative methods and corrects the common practice of considering the inflection point price as market price. In fact, we demonstrate that the optimal price is consistently lower than the inflection-point price under reasonable assumptions, leading to lower prices for consumers and higher revenue for sellers. Numerical experiments illustrate the proposed algorithm and examine the changes in the optimality gap as demand function parameters vary. Results indicate that the optimal price is consistently lower than the inflection-point price, with an average 20% price reduction accompanied by a 15% increase in revenue.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine-learning-based solution approach for solving multi-horizon stochastic programs. The approach embeds a deep learning neural network into a multi-horizon stochastic program to approximate the recourse operational objective function. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a UK power system planning problem with uncertainty at investment and operational timescales. The results show that (1) the surrogate neural network performs well across three different architectures, (2) the proposed approach is up to 34.72 times faster than the direct solution of the monolithic deterministic equivalent counterpart, (3) the surrogate-based solutions yield comparable in-sample stability and improved out-of-sample performance relative to the deterministic equivalent, indicating better generalisation to unseen scenarios. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) we propose a machine-learning-based framework for solving multi-horizon stochastic programs, (2) we introduce a neural network embedding formulation tailored to multi-horizon stochastic programs with continuous first-stage decisions and fixed scenario sets, extending existing surrogate modelling approaches from two-stage to multi-horizon settings, and (3) we provide an extensive computational study on a realistic UK power system planning problem, demonstrating the trade-off between approximation accuracy, computational efficiency, and solution robustness for different neural network architectures and scenario set sizes.

Motivation: 小型卫星使用磁力矩器作为执行器进行稳定和姿态控制。NMPC生成的控制输入是连续平滑的，但机载执行器难以产生这些连续的磁矩作为控制输入，因此需要将连续控制信号离散化以降低执行器负载。

Method: 采用脉宽调制(PWM)方法对非线性模型预测控制(NMPC)生成的连续控制输入进行离散化处理，使磁力矩器能够更有效地执行控制指令。

Result: 通过消旋和姿态控制的仿真验证了所提方法的有效性和可行性，PWM成功地将NMPC的连续控制输入离散化，降低了执行器负载。

Conclusion: PWM与NMPC结合的方法能够有效解决卫星姿态控制中连续控制输入与离散执行器之间的不匹配问题，提高了控制系统的实用性和执行器效率。

Abstract: This paper employs Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) method to a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for satellite attitude control and detumbling. Magnetic torquers have been used as actuators for the stabilization and attitude control of small satellites. NMPC generates the control input which is continuous and smooth. As a result, it is challenging for the on-board actuators to produce these continuous magnetic moments as a control input. Thus, PWM is applied to discretize the control input reducing the load on the actuators. Simulations are presented for detumbling and attitude control to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PID控制器是工程系统中最广泛使用的反馈方法，但现有研究主要针对确定性系统。需要研究PID在处理非线性、不确定性和随机噪声方面的机制，特别是对于更一般的非线性随机系统。

Method: 针对具有任意相对度n的非线性随机系统，提出扩展PID控制器（PID的自然扩展）。通过理论分析证明，当扩展PID参数从(n+1)维无界集合中选择时，闭环控制系统可实现均方全局稳定。

Result: 证明了闭环控制系统在均方意义下全局稳定，跟踪误差有界，即使系统非线性漂移项和扩散项包含广泛的结构不确定性。稳态跟踪误差与设定点的噪声强度成正比，通过适当增大控制器参数可使误差任意小。

Conclusion: 扩展PID控制器能够有效处理具有任意相对度的非线性随机系统，在适当参数选择下可实现全局稳定性和良好的跟踪性能，为PID在复杂随机环境中的应用提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Since the classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller has continued to be the most widely used feedback methods in engineering systems by far, it is crucial to investigate the working mechanism of PID in dealing with nonlinearity, uncertainty and random noises. Recently, Zhao and Guo (2022) has established the global stability of PID control for a class of uncertain nonlinear control systems with relative degree two without random perturbations. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of nonlinear stochastic systems with an arbitrary relative degree $n$, and discuss the stability and design of extended PID controller (a natural extension of PID). We demonstrate that, the closed-loop control systems will be globally stable in mean square with bounded tracking errors provided the extended PID parameters are selected from an $(n+1)$-dimensional unbounded set, even if both the system nonlinear drift and diffusion terms contain a wide range of structural uncertainties. Moreover, the steady-state tracking error is proved to be proportional to the noise intensity at the setpoint, which can also be made arbitrarily small by choosing the controller parameters suitably large.

Abstract: This work presents a comparative study of optimization techniques for parameter identification in equivalent electrical models of lithium-ion batteries. The 2RC model is applied to a set of twelve batteries using four publicly available datasets obtained from well-established research institutions. The methodology is structured in four stages: first, the 2RC model is selected due to its balance between physical interpretability and computational simplicity; second, experimental charge-discharge cycle data are collected; third, various optimization techniques are applied with the aim of minimizing the error between the experimental data and the response estimated by the model; and finally, accuracy is evaluated using the mean squared error, while computational efficiency is assessed through execution time. Traditional, metaheuristic, and bio-inspired optimization methods are considered, including least squares optimization, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and several nature-inspired variants. It is demonstrated that bio-inspired techniques achieve greater accuracy than traditional methods, without a significant increase in computational cost. In particular, particle swarm optimization shows superior performance in terms of precision and robustness against local minima. It is concluded that the integration of advanced optimization strategies significantly enhances the fidelity of equivalent electrical models, which is essential for accurate estimation of internal states such as state of charge, aging, and service life in lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles and aerospace systems.

Abstract: In the framework of data envelopment analysis, we review directional models \citep{Chambers1996, Chambers1998, Briec1997} and show that they are inadequate when inputs and outputs are improved simultaneously under constant returns to scale. Conversely, we introduce a new family of quadratically constrained models with generalized orientation and demonstrate that these models overcome this limitation. Furthermore, we extend the Farrell measure of technical efficiency using these new models. Additionally, we prove that the family of generalized oriented models satisfies some desired monotonicity properties. Finally, we show that the new models, although being quadratically constrained, can be solved through linear programs in a fundamental particular case.

Abstract: With the advancement of industrialization and Industry 4.0, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has emerged as a novel paradigm for information exchange in industrial production environments. To ensure the efficient operation of IIoT, it is imperative to develop communication-efficient methods for transmitting massive production data. This paper designs a communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithm for optimization problems subject to coupled equality constraints. While compressed communication is employed to enhance efficiency, it comes at the cost of introducing compression errors that may impair algorithm performance. To eliminate the influence of compression errors, differential compression techniques along with dynamic scaling factors are incorporated into the algorithm design. Linear convergence and constraint satisfaction of the algorithm are established under different types of compressors. Numerical results further demonstrate its effectiveness across three compression scenarios with specific quantizers.

Abstract: This paper studies sum-of-squares (SOS) representations for structured biquadratic forms. We prove that diagonally dominated symmetric biquadratic tensors are always SOS. For the special case of symmetric biquadratic forms, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for positive semi-definiteness of monic symmetric biquadratic forms, characterize the geometry of the corresponding psd cone, and prove that every such psd form is SOS. We also formulate conjectures regarding SOS representations for symmetric M-biquadratic tensors and symmetric B$_0$-biquadratic tensors, discussing their likelihood and potential proof strategies. Our results advance the understanding of when positive semi-definiteness implies sum-of-squares decompositions for structured biquadratic forms.

Abstract: This paper studies the continuous-time reinforcement learning for stochastic singular control with the application to an infinite-horizon irreversible reinsurance problems. The singular control is equivalently characterized as a pair of regions of time and the augmented states, called the singular control law. To encourage the exploration in the learning procedure, we propose a randomization method for the singular control laws, new to the literature, by considering an auxiliary singular control and entropy regularization. The exploratory singular control problem is formulated as a two-stage optimal control problem, where the time-inconsistency issue arises in the outer problem. In the specific model setup with known model coefficients, we provide the full characterization of the time-consistent equilibrium singular controls for the two-stage problem. Taking advantage of the solution structure, we can consider the proper parameterization of the randomized equilibrium policy and the value function when the model is unknown and further devise the actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms. In the numerical experiment, we present the superior convergence of parameter iterations towards the true values based on the randomized equilibrium policy and illustrate how the exploration may advance the learning performance in the context of singular controls.

Abstract: We propose an abstract framework to establish the convergence of the iterates of stochastic versions of a broad range of monotone operator splitting methods in Hilbert spaces. This framework allows for the introduction of stochasticity at several levels: approximation of operators, selection of coordinates and operators in block-iterative implementations, and relaxation parameters. The proposed analysis involves a reduced inclusion model with two operators. At each iteration, stochastic approximations to points in the graphs of these two operators are used to form the update. The results are applied to derive the almost sure and $L^2$ convergence of stochastic versions of the proximal point algorithm, as well as of randomized block-iterative projective splitting methods for solving systems of coupled inclusions involving a mix of set-valued, cocoercive, and Lipschitzian monotone operators combined via various monotonicity-preserving operations.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: 加密货币HODL策略存在严重幸存者偏差，大多数投资者面临极端下行风险，只有最幸运的25%能获得高回报；宏观情绪指标而非历史收益是未来收益的主要预测因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币投资者常引用比特币的历史表现来推广其他代币并制造FOMO情绪，但随着加密货币通过主要券商越来越容易为散户投资者接触，了解真实的风险回报权衡以及影响未来收益的因素变得至关重要。

Method: 1. 对378种非稳定币加密货币进行4.8亿次蒙特卡洛模拟，扣除交易费用和1个月国债的机会成本；2. 使用贝叶斯多期本地投影框架分析内生预测因子和宏观金融因素对收益的影响。

Result: 1. HODL策略存在严重幸存者偏差和极端下行风险集中：2-3年期限的中位数超额收益为-28.4%，尾部情景会抹去本金，只有前25%能获得平均1326.7%的超额收益；2. 基于已实现风险收益指标的内生预测因子影响经济上可忽略且不稳定，而宏观金融因素（特别是恐惧贪婪指数的24周指数移动平均）显示出持久的长周期影响和高跨篮子稳定性。

Conclusion: HODL策略对大多数投资者构成极端下行风险，高回报主要属于最幸运的少数人；宏观情绪条件而非历史收益是未来结果的主要指标，这对加密货币投资策略有重要启示。

Abstract: Crypto enthusiasts claim that buying and holding crypto assets yields high returns, often citing Bitcoin's past performance to promote other tokens and fuel fear of missing out. However, understanding the real risk-return trade-off and what factors affect future crypto returns is crucial as crypto becomes increasingly accessible to retail investors through major brokerages. We examine the HODL strategy through two independent analyses. First, we implement 480 million Monte Carlo simulations across 378 non-stablecoin crypto assets, net of trading fees and the opportunity cost of 1-month Treasury bills, and find strong evidence of survivorship bias and extreme downside concentration. At the 2-3 year horizon, the median excess return is -28.4 percent, the 1 percent conditional value at risk indicates that tail scenarios wipe out principal after all costs, and only the top quartile achieves very large gains, with a mean excess return of 1,326.7 percent. These results challenge the HODL narrative: across a broad set of assets, simple buy-and-hold loads extreme downside risk onto most investors, and the miracles mostly belong to the luckiest quarter. Second, using a Bayesian multi-horizon local projection framework, we find that endogenous predictors based on realized risk-return metrics have economically negligible and unstable effects, while macro-finance factors, especially the 24-week exponential moving average of the Fear and Greed Index, display persistent long-horizon impacts and high cross-basket stability. Where significant, a one-standard-deviation sentiment shock reduces forward top-quartile mean excess returns by 15-22 percentage points and median returns by 6-10 percentage points over 1-3 year horizons, suggesting that macro-sentiment conditions, rather than realized return histories, are the dominant indicators for future outcomes.

### [121] [Visibility-Graph Asymmetry as a Structural Indicator of Volatility Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02352)
*Michał Sikorski*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于水平可见图(HVG)时间反转对称性的模型无关方法来检测金融时间序列中的波动率聚集现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波动率聚集是金融市场中最稳健的典型事实之一，但传统方法通常使用基于矩的诊断或参数模型（如GARCH）来检测。本文旨在开发一种更简单、模型无关且几何可解释的方法来检测波动率聚集。

Method: 在物理时间中对绝对收益率构建水平可见图(HVG)，计算每个时间点的最大前向和后向可见距离L⁺(t)和L⁻(t)，使用其经验分布构建可见性不对称指纹，包括Kolmogorov-Smirnov距离、方差差异、熵差异和极端可见跨度比率。

Result: 蒙特卡洛研究中，HVG不对称特征能清晰区分波动率聚集的GARCH(1,1)动态与i.i.d.高斯噪声以及随机洗牌的GARCH序列；基于指纹的简单线性分类器达到约90%的样本内准确率。应用于标普500日数据显示显著的前后不平衡，方差差异ΔVar超过模拟GARCH值两个数量级，洗牌后消失。

Conclusion: 可见图不对称指纹作为一种简单、模型无关且几何可解释的指标，能有效检测金融时间序列中的波动率聚集和时间不可逆性。

Abstract: Volatility clustering is one of the most robust stylized facts of financial markets, yet it is typically detected using moment-based diagnostics or parametric models such as GARCH. This paper shows that clustered volatility also leaves a clear imprint on the time-reversal symmetry of horizontal visibility graphs (HVGs) constructed on absolute returns in physical time. For each time point, we compute the maximal forward and backward visibility distances, $L^{+}(t)$ and $L^{-}(t)$, and use their empirical distributions to build a visibility-asymmetry fingerprint comprising the Kolmogorov--Smirnov distance, variance difference, entropy difference, and a ratio of extreme visibility spans. In a Monte Carlo study, these HVG asymmetry features sharply separate volatility-clustered GARCH(1,1) dynamics from i.i.d.\ Gaussian noise and from randomly shuffled GARCH series that preserve the marginal distribution but destroy temporal dependence; a simple linear classifier based on the fingerprint achieves about 90\% in-sample accuracy. Applying the method to daily S\&P500 data reveals a pronounced forward--backward imbalance, including a variance difference $Δ\mathrm{Var}$ that exceeds the simulated GARCH values by two orders of magnitude and vanishes after shuffling. Overall, the visibility-graph asymmetry fingerprint emerges as a simple, model-free, and geometrically interpretable indicator of volatility clustering and time irreversibility in financial time series.

Method: 使用PCA、ETF和LSTM三种方法构建风险因子来复制主要资产，通过Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程建模残差的均值回归特性，生成交易信号，并在波兰市场（WIG20、mWIG40等）进行实证。

Result: 2017-2019年所有方法均盈利，PCA表现最佳（累计收益约20%，年化夏普比率达2.63）。2020年COVID-19衰退期间，仅ETF方法保持盈利（约5%年收益），PCA和LSTM表现不佳，但LSTM结果有优化潜力。

Conclusion: 风险因子复制方法在正常市场条件下有效，但不同复制技术在不同市场环境中的表现存在差异。LSTM虽在衰退期表现不佳，但显示出未来优化潜力，为深度学习在统计套利中的应用提供了方向。

Abstract: We study a systematic approach to a popular Statistical Arbitrage technique: Pairs Trading. Instead of relying on two highly correlated assets, we replace the second asset with a replication of the first using risk factor representations. These factors are obtained through Principal Components Analysis (PCA), exchange traded funds (ETFs), and, as our main contribution, Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs). Residuals between the main asset and its replication are examined for mean reversion properties, and trading signals are generated for sufficiently fast mean reverting portfolios.
  Beyond introducing a deep learning based replication method, we adapt the framework of Avellaneda and Lee (2008) to the Polish market. Accordingly, components of WIG20, mWIG40, and selected sector indices replace the original S&P500 universe, and market parameters such as the risk free rate and transaction costs are updated to reflect local conditions.
  We outline the full strategy pipeline: risk factor construction, residual modeling via the Ornstein Uhlenbeck process, and signal generation. Each replication technique is described together with its practical implementation. Strategy performance is evaluated over two periods: 2017-2019 and the recessive year 2020.
  All methods yield profits in 2017-2019, with PCA achieving roughly 20 percent cumulative return and an annualized Sharpe ratio of up to 2.63. Despite multiple adaptations, our conclusions remain consistent with those of the original paper. During the COVID-19 recession, only the ETF based approach remains profitable (about 5 percent annual return), while PCA and LSTM methods underperform. LSTM results, although negative, are promising and indicate potential for future optimization.

### [123] [Opening the Black Box: Nowcasting Singapore's GDP Growth and its Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02092)
*Luca Attolico*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 开发用于新加坡季度GDP增长的实时临近预报框架，使用约70个指标的高维面板数据，涵盖多种机器学习方法，结果显示惩罚回归、降维模型和GRU网络优于基准模型，RMSFE降低40-60%，聚合带来进一步改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对于新加坡这样的小型开放经济体，及时评估当前状况至关重要，因为外部冲击会迅速传导至国内经济活动。需要开发实时临近预报框架来准确预测季度GDP增长。

Method: 使用1990Q1-2023Q2期间约70个经济金融指标的高维面板数据，涵盖惩罚回归、降维方法、集成学习算法和神经网络架构。采用扩展窗口向前滚动设计，保留时间顺序，使用贝叶斯超参数优化。通过移动块自举程序构建预测区间和特征重要性置信带。采用模型特定和XAI可解释性工具，通过模型置信集程序识别统计上优越的学习器，然后通过简单、加权和指数加权方案进行组合。

Result: 惩罚回归、降维模型和GRU网络在所有基准测试中表现一致优异，RMSFE降低约40-60%。聚合进一步提高了预测性能。特征归因方法显示工业生产、对外贸易和劳动力市场指标是新加坡短期增长动态的主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 开发的高维实时临近预报框架有效提升了新加坡季度GDP增长的预测准确性，机器学习方法显著优于传统基准模型，特征重要性分析为政策制定提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Timely assessment of current conditions is essential especially for small, open economies such as Singapore, where external shocks transmit rapidly to domestic activity. We develop a real-time nowcasting framework for quarterly GDP growth using a high-dimensional panel of approximately 70 indicators, encompassing economic and financial indicators over 1990Q1-2023Q2. The analysis covers penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction methods, ensemble learning algorithms, and neural architectures, benchmarked against a Random Walk, an AR(3), and a Dynamic Factor Model. The pipeline preserves temporal ordering through an expanding-window walk-forward design with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and uses moving block-bootstrap procedures both to construct prediction intervals and to obtain confidence bands for feature-importance measures. It adopts model-specific and XAI-based explainability tools. A Model Confidence Set procedure identifies statistically superior learners, which are then combined through simple, weighted, and exponentially weighted schemes; the resulting time-varying weights provide an interpretable representation of model contributions. Predictive ability is assessed via Giacomini-White tests. Empirical results show that penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction models, and GRU networks consistently outperform all benchmarks, with RMSFE reductions of roughly 40-60%; aggregation delivers further gains. Feature-attribution methods highlight industrial production, external trade, and labor-market indicators as dominant drivers of Singapore's short-run growth dynamics.

*Lucas Resende,Guillaume Lecué,Lionel Wilner,Philippe Choné*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出一种新的无偏估计器，通过将多向引力模型估计重构为分类任务，解决PPML中的伴随参数问题，在稀疏数据环境下计算更快、估计更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最大似然估计器（如PPML）存在伴随参数问题：在联合估计结构参数和干扰参数时会产生偏差。特别是在网络形成文献中常见的稀疏数据环境下，这一问题更为突出。

Method: 将多向引力模型的估计重构为一系列分类任务，该方法对固定效应的数量和结构具有不可知性。在稀疏数据环境下，计算速度比PPML更快。

Result: 新估计器比PPML及其偏差校正策略产生更准确的点估计和置信区间。即使在模型设定错误的情况下，这些改进仍然成立，且在稀疏设置中更为明显。PPML在密集、低维数据中仍具竞争力，但新方法为多向模型提供了可扩展的稳健替代方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为多向引力模型提供了一种新的无偏估计器，特别适用于稀疏数据环境，在法国医疗保健空间可达性的政策改革效应估计中得到了应用验证。

Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimators, such as the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML), suffer from the incidental parameter problem: a bias in the estimation of structural parameters that arises from the joint estimation of structural and nuisance parameters. To address this issue in multi-way gravity models, we propose a novel, asymptotically unbiased estimator. Our method reframes the estimation as a series of classification tasks and is agnostic to both the number and structure of fixed effects. In sparse data environments, common in the network formation literature, it is also computationally faster than PPML. We provide empirical evidence that our estimator yields more accurate point estimates and confidence intervals than PPML and its bias-correction strategies. These improvements hold even under model misspecification and are more pronounced in sparse settings. While PPML remains competitive in dense, low-dimensional data, our approach offers a robust alternative for multi-way models that scales efficiently with sparsity. The method is applied to estimate the effect of a policy reform on spatial accessibility to health care in France.

### [125] [Identification of Multivariate Measurement Error Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02970)
*Yingyao Hu*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 该论文为多维连续测量误差模型开发了新的识别方法，即使所有观测测量都受到潜在相关误差污染且没有测量提供潜在分布的注入映射，仍能识别潜在因子和测量误差的联合分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实证研究中，许多领域（因子模型、调查数据报告误差、计量经济学中的测量误差回归变量、心理学和市场营销中的多维潜在特质模型）都面临噪声或间接测量问题。传统方法通常需要至少一个"干净"的测量（注入映射），这在现实中往往难以满足。本文旨在开发更广泛的识别条件，即使所有测量都受污染且没有注入映射，也能恢复潜在结构。

Method: 1. 使用三阶交叉矩构造三向张量，利用Kruskal定理保证的唯一分解识别因子载荷矩阵；2. 从线性结构出发，通过构造合适的测量并应用标量或多变量版本的Kotlarski恒等式，恢复潜在因子的完整分布；3. 在注入性条件下，提供用户友好的可测试识别条件；4. 对于非线性模型，使用新定义的广义Kruskal秩（信号秩）的积分算子提供一般识别结果。

Result: 1. 证明了即使所有观测测量都受到潜在相关误差污染且没有测量提供注入映射，潜在向量和测量误差的联合分布也能被完全识别；2. 表明多元潜在结构可以在比先前认为的更广泛设置中恢复；3. 提供了适用于线性模型的实用识别条件；4. 开发了适用于非线性模型的一般识别理论。

Conclusion: 该论文扩展了多维测量误差模型的识别边界，表明即使在没有干净测量的情况下，多元潜在结构也能被恢复。这些结果为涉及噪声或间接测量的实证工作提供了更广泛的适用性，包括因子模型、调查数据、测量误差回归变量和潜在特质模型，可能在无法获得干净测量时实现更稳健的估计和解释。

Abstract: This paper develops new identification results for multidimensional continuous measurement-error models where all observed measurements are contaminated by potentially correlated errors and none provides an injective mapping of the latent distribution. Using third order cross moments, the paper constructs a three way tensor whose unique decomposition, guaranteed by Kruskal theorem, identifies the factor loading matrices. Starting with a linear structure, the paper recovers the full distribution of latent factors by constructing suitable measurements and applying scalar or multivariate versions of Kotlarski identity. As a result, the joint distribution of the latent vector and measurement errors is fully identified without requiring injective measurements, showing that multivariate latent structure can be recovered in broader settings than previously believed. Under injectivity, the paper also provides user-friendly testable conditions for identification. Finally, this paper provides general identification results for nonlinear models using a newly-defined generalized Kruskal rank - signal rank - of intergral operators. These results have wide applicability in empirical work involving noisy or indirect measurements, including factor models, survey data with reporting errors, mismeasured regressors in econometrics, and multidimensional latent-trait models in psychology and marketing, potentially enabling more robust estimation and interpretation when clean measurements are unavailable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用AI模型的快速发展加剧了训练数据中的版权侵权担忧，现有监管框架主要是被动反应而非主动预防，存在执行机制的关键缺口，威胁创作者权利和AI发展的可持续性。

Method: 分析主要司法管辖区（欧盟、美国、亚太地区）的AI训练数据治理监管格局，通过案例研究识别训练前数据过滤的关键缺口，提出结合访问控制、内容验证、机器学习分类器和持续数据库交叉引用的多层过滤管道。

Result: 识别出两个根本挑战：训练前许可收集和内容过滤面临大规模全面版权管理的不可能性，验证机制缺乏确认过滤防止侵权的工具。现有解决方案（透明度工具、感知哈希、访问控制）只能解决特定方面问题。

Conclusion: 提出的多层过滤管道为保护创作者权利同时促进AI创新提供了路径，将版权保护从训练后检测转向训练前预防，解决了现有监管框架的被动性问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of general-purpose AI models has increased concerns about copyright infringement in training data, yet current regulatory frameworks remain predominantly reactive rather than proactive. This paper examines the regulatory landscape of AI training data governance in major jurisdictions, including the EU, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region. It also identifies critical gaps in enforcement mechanisms that threaten both creator rights and the sustainability of AI development. Through analysis of major cases we identified critical gaps in pre-training data filtering. Existing solutions such as transparency tools, perceptual hashing, and access control mechanisms address only specific aspects of the problem and cannot prevent initial copyright violations. We identify two fundamental challenges: pre-training license collection and content filtering, which faces the impossibility of comprehensive copyright management at scale, and verification mechanisms, which lack tools to confirm filtering prevented infringement. We propose a multilayered filtering pipeline that combines access control, content verification, machine learning classifiers, and continuous database cross-referencing to shift copyright protection from post-training detection to pre-training prevention. This approach offers a pathway toward protecting creator rights while enabling continued AI innovation.

Motivation: 研究AI如何影响企业决策过程，探索AI采用对管理绩效、决策效率和实施障碍的影响，为数字技术如何重塑管理和人机混合决策环境提供实证依据。

Method: 采用定量调查方法，对跨多个行业的92家公司进行研究，分析AI采用如何影响管理绩效、决策效率和组织障碍。

Result: 93%的企业使用AI，主要应用于客户服务、数据预测和决策支持。AI提高了决策速度和清晰度，但面临员工抵制、高成本和监管模糊等主要障碍。组织因素比技术限制更重要，成功的关键在于理解算法机制和变革管理，而非编程技能。员工在适应AI工具方面存在困难，特别是在制定提示和接受系统输出时。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence improves enterprise decision-making by accelerating data analysis, reducing human error, and supporting evidence-based choices. A quantitative survey of 92 companies across multiple industries examines how AI adoption influences managerial performance, decision efficiency, and organizational barriers. Results show that 93 percent of firms use AI, primarily in customer service, data forecasting, and decision support. AI systems increase the speed and clarity of managerial decisions, yet implementation faces challenges. The most frequent barriers include employee resistance, high costs, and regulatory ambiguity. Respondents indicate that organizational factors are more significant than technological limitations. Critical competencies for successful AI use include understanding algorithmic mechanisms and change management. Technical skills such as programming play a smaller role. Employees report difficulties in adapting to AI tools, especially when formulating prompts or accepting system outputs. The study highlights the importance of integrating AI with human judgment and communication practices. When supported by adaptive leadership and transparent processes, AI adoption enhances organizational agility and strengthens decision-making performance. These findings contribute to ongoing research on how digital technologies reshape management and the evolution of hybrid human-machine decision environments.

TL;DR: LLM生成的社会角色在低资源环境（孟加拉国）中表现不如真人，尤其在共情和可信度方面差距显著，且存在系统性积极偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM能够生成AI角色，但缺乏深层次的情境、文化和情感理解，特别是在低资源环境中，需要验证LLM角色是否能真实反映现实人类的体验。

Method: 在孟加拉国低资源环境中，使用文化特定问题，定量比较人类回答与8个LLM生成社会角色（如男性、女性、穆斯林、政治支持者等）的响应。

Result: 人类回答在所有问题上显著优于所有LLM，在所有角色感知指标上表现更好，特别是在共情和可信度方面差距最大。LLM生成内容存在系统性积极偏见（Pollyanna原则），平均积极情感得分更高（LLM: 5.99 vs 人类: 5.60）。

Conclusion: LLM角色不能准确反映低资源环境中真实人类的体验。在社会科学研究中部署LLM角色前，必须用真实世界人类数据进行验证，以确保其一致性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate AI personas, yet their lack of deep contextual, cultural, and emotional understanding poses a significant limitation. This study quantitatively compared human responses with those of eight LLM-generated social personas (e.g., Male, Female, Muslim, Political Supporter) within a low-resource environment like Bangladesh, using culturally specific questions. Results show human responses significantly outperform all LLMs in answering questions, and across all matrices of persona perception, with particularly large gaps in empathy and credibility. Furthermore, LLM-generated content exhibited a systematic bias along the lines of the ``Pollyanna Principle'', scoring measurably higher in positive sentiment ($Φ_{avg} = 5.99$ for LLMs vs. $5.60$ for Humans). These findings suggest that LLM personas do not accurately reflect the authentic experience of real people in resource-scarce environments. It is essential to validate LLM personas against real-world human data to ensure their alignment and reliability before deploying them in social science research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合建筑连接度和道路质量的综合道路可达性剥夺模型，应用于非洲三个城市，评估了不同剥夺水平的分布和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速城市化的撒哈拉以南非洲地区，许多城市社区特别是非正规住区缺乏道路连接，需要可扩展的工具来识别这些被剥夺区域以指导城市规划。

Method: 开发了道路可达性剥夺模型，结合建筑连接度指标和道路表面类型数据（作为道路质量代理），将城市区域分为低、中、高三个剥夺水平，使用开放地理空间数据集在三个非洲城市应用。

Result: 三个城市大部分建成区属于低和中度剥夺，高度剥夺区域相对有限但差异显著（内罗毕11.8%，卡诺27.7%）。模型在识别低剥夺区域表现良好（F1>0.74），中度剥夺表现中等，高度剥夺表现波动较大（F1 0.26-0.69）。社区验证数据间一致性高，分歧主要发生在相邻剥夺水平之间。

Conclusion: 该道路可达性剥夺建模方法作为可扩展、可解释的工具，在数据稀缺环境下识别断开连接区域和指导城市规划方面显示出潜力，同时讨论了模型与社区认知之间的差异来源。

Abstract: Access to motorable roads is a critical dimension of urban infrastructure, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, many urban communities, especially those in informal settlements, remain disconnected from road networks. This study presents a road access deprivation model that combines a new accessibility metric, capturing how well buildings are connected to the road network, with road surface type data as a proxy for road quality. These two components together enable the classification of urban areas into low, medium, or high deprivation levels. The model was applied to Nairobi (Kenya), Lagos (Nigeria), and Kano (Nigeria) using open geospatial datasets. Across all three cities, the majority of built-up areas fall into the low and medium road access deprivation levels, while highly deprived areas are comparatively limited. However, the share of highly deprived areas varies substantially, ranging from only 11.8 % in Nairobi to 27.7 % in Kano. Model evaluation against community-sourced validation data indicates good performance for identifying low deprivation areas (F1 > 0.74), moderate accuracy for medium deprivation in Nairobi and Lagos (F1 > 0.52, lower in Kano), and more variable results for high deprivation (F1 ranging from 0.26 in Kano to 0.69 in Nairobi). Furthermore, analysis of grid cells with multiple validations showed strong agreement among community members, with disagreements occurring mainly between adjacent deprivation levels. Finally, we discussed two types of sources for disagreement with community validations: (1) misalignment between the conceptual model and community perceptions, and (2) the operationalization of the conceptual model. In summary, our road access deprivation modeling approach demonstrates promise as a scalable, interpretable tool for identifying disconnected areas and informing urban planning in data-scarce contexts.

TL;DR: MEVIR框架整合理性推理、美德认识论和道德直觉，解释信任决策中的复杂性、两极分化和错误信息问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统理性代理人模型无法捕捉人类信任形成的复杂性，需要整合理性、品格和前理性直觉的综合模型来解释21世纪信息环境中的信任决策挑战。

Method: 提出MEVIR框架，整合三个理论视角：程序性证据收集模型、Zagzebski美德认识论、扩展道德基础理论，引入本体论概念（真理承载者、真理制造者、本体解包），通过疫苗接种和气候政策案例研究分析。

Result: MEVIR将认知偏见重新定义为应用认识美德的系统性失败，展示不同道德基础如何导致个体构建内部一致的"信任格"，政治两极分化源于道德先验、认识权威和评估启发式的深层分歧。

Conclusion: MEVIR框架为决策支持系统提供基础，帮助增强元认知、识别偏见和实践认识美德，未来研究需进行纵向研究并承认框架局限性。

Abstract: The 21st-century information landscape presents an unprecedented challenge: how do individuals make sound trust decisions amid complexity, polarization, and misinformation? Traditional rational-agent models fail to capture human trust formation, which involves a complex synthesis of reason, character, and pre-rational intuition. This report introduces the Moral-Epistemic VIRtue informed (MEVIR) framework, a comprehensive descriptive model integrating three theoretical perspectives: (1) a procedural model describing evidence-gathering and reasoning chains; (2) Linda Zagzebski's virtue epistemology, characterizing intellectual disposition and character-driven processes; and (3) Extended Moral Foundations Theory (EMFT), explaining rapid, automatic moral intuitions that anchor reasoning. Central to the framework are ontological concepts - Truth Bearers, Truth Makers, and Ontological Unpacking-revealing that disagreements often stem from fundamental differences in what counts as admissible reality. MEVIR reframes cognitive biases as systematic failures in applying epistemic virtues and demonstrates how different moral foundations lead agents to construct separate, internally coherent "trust lattices". Through case studies on vaccination mandates and climate policy, the framework shows that political polarization represents deeper divergence in moral priors, epistemic authorities, and evaluative heuristics. The report analyzes how propaganda, psychological operations, and echo chambers exploit the MEVIR process. The framework provides foundation for a Decision Support System to augment metacognition, helping individuals identify biases and practice epistemic virtues. The report concludes by acknowledging limitations and proposing longitudinal studies for future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出一个三层伦理框架，基于哲学不确定性处理AI意识问题，强调人类中心主义，包含无意识推定、风险审慎和透明推理原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI伦理框架存在三个主要问题：依赖有争议的功能主义假设、优先考虑推测性的AI福利而非具体人类利益、缺乏连贯的理论基础。随着AI系统日益复杂，关于机器意识及其伦理影响的问题已从边缘推测转向主流学术辩论，需要更严谨的伦理框架。

Method: 提出结构化三层框架：1) 基础层：确立关于AI意识的五个事实判断，采用人类中心主义作为元伦理立场；2) 操作层：推导出三个操作原则（无意识推定、风险审慎、透明推理）；3) 应用层：通过透明逻辑过程推导出紧迫伦理问题的默认立场，每个立场都可明确追溯到基础承诺。

Result: 该框架平衡了哲学严谨性与实践指导性，区分了意识与拟人化，为负责任的发展创造了途径，随着科学理解的进步，为应对这些深刻的伦理挑战提供了以人类为中心的基础。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个基于哲学不确定性的结构化伦理框架，强调人类中心主义，通过无意识推定、风险审慎和透明推理原则，为AI意识伦理问题提供了连贯的理论基础和实践指导，确保在科学理解进步的同时保持负责任的发展路径。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, questions about machine consciousness and its ethical implications have moved from fringe speculation to mainstream academic debate. Current ethical frameworks in this domain often implicitly rely on contested functionalist assumptions, prioritize speculative AI welfare over concrete human interests, and lack coherent theoretical foundations. We address these limitations through a structured three-level framework grounded in philosophical uncertainty. At the foundational level, we establish five factual determinations about AI consciousness alongside human-centralism as our meta-ethical stance. These foundations logically entail three operational principles: presumption of no consciousness (placing the burden of proof on consciousness claims), risk prudence (prioritizing human welfare under uncertainty), and transparent reasoning (enabling systematic evaluation and adaptation). At the application level, the third component of our framework, we derive default positions on pressing ethical questions through a transparent logical process where each position can be explicitly traced back to our foundational commitments. Our approach balances philosophical rigor with practical guidance, distinguishes consciousness from anthropomorphism, and creates pathways for responsible evolution as scientific understanding advances, providing a human-centric foundation for navigating these profound ethical challenges.

Result: 研究发现AI采用率极低（仅1家机构报告使用AI工具），50%的机构表示"未持有相关信息"（即无正式脱敏政策），普遍存在员工培训不足问题。识别出三大关键障碍：记录保存实践不佳、缺乏标准化脱敏指南、人类监督的专业培训不足。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了技术可能性与组织现实之间的显著差距，强调需要采用社会技术方法，在技术自动化与有意义的人类专业知识之间取得平衡。为政策制定者提供了关于透明度义务、数据保护要求和新兴AI技术复杂互动的实证证据。

Abstract: Document redaction in public authorities faces critical challenges as traditional manual approaches struggle to balance growing transparency demands with increasingly stringent data protection requirements. This study investigates the implementation of AI-driven document redaction within UK public authorities through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. While AI technologies offer potential solutions to redaction challenges, their actual implementation within public sector organizations remains underexplored. Based on responses from 44 public authorities across healthcare, government, and higher education sectors, this study reveals significant gaps between technological possibilities and organizational realities. Findings show highly limited AI adoption (only one authority reported using AI tools), widespread absence of formal redaction policies (50 percent reported "information not held"), and deficiencies in staff training. The study identifies three key barriers to effective AI implementation: poor record-keeping practices, lack of standardized redaction guidelines, and insufficient specialized training for human oversight. These findings highlight the need for a socio-technical approach that balances technological automation with meaningful human expertise. This research provides the first empirical assessment of AI redaction practices in UK public authorities and contributes evidence to support policymakers navigating the complex interplay between transparency obligations, data protection requirements, and emerging AI technologies in public administration.

*Kentaro Kubo,Hayato Goto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Langevin SB (LSB)采样器和条件期望匹配(CEM)方法，建立采样器自适应学习(SAL)框架，用于高效训练比受限玻尔兹曼机更具表达力的玻尔兹曼机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 玻尔兹曼机是强大的基于能量的生成模型，但训练成本高，实际应用多局限于受限玻尔兹曼机。更准确的学习需要马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛玻尔兹曼采样，但由于难以并行化而耗时。

Method: 1. 提出受量子启发组合优化模拟分叉启发的Langevin SB (LSB)采样器，实现并行采样；2. 开发条件期望匹配(CEM)方法，在学习过程中估计逆温度；3. 结合LSB和CEM建立采样器自适应学习(SAL)框架。

Result: LSB在保持与MCMC相当精度的同时实现并行采样，适用于具有一般耦合的玻尔兹曼机。SAL框架为超越受限玻尔兹曼机的基于能量生成建模开辟了新途径。

Conclusion: 通过LSB采样器和CEM方法建立的SAL框架，实现了对更具表达力的玻尔兹曼机的高效学习，突破了传统受限玻尔兹曼机的局限性。

Abstract: Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.

Abstract: Diabetes is a serious worldwide health issue, and successful intervention depends on early detection. However, overlapping risk factors and data asymmetry make prediction difficult. To use extensive health survey data to create a machine learning framework for diabetes classification that is both accurate and comprehensible, to produce results that will aid in clinical decision-making. Using the BRFSS dataset, we assessed a number of supervised learning techniques. SMOTE and Tomek Links were used to correct class imbalance.

TL;DR: VoxCap：基于药效团体素生成模型，解决传统药效团虚拟筛选的扩展性和生成性问题，通过体素标注生成SMILES，实现高效的新分子设计和快速搜索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于药效团的虚拟筛选方法存在两个主要问题：1）随着分子库规模增大，计算成本急剧增加；2）只能从现有化合物库中筛选，无法生成新分子。需要一种既能保持药效团相似性，又能高效生成新分子的方法。

Method: 提出VoxCap体素标注方法，将分子表示为体素化形式，然后生成对应的SMILES字符串。设计了两种工作流程：1）从头设计：生成与查询分子具有高药效团形状相似性的新分子；2）快速搜索：结合生成设计和廉价的2D子结构相似性搜索，实现高效命中识别。

Result: VoxCap在生成多样化从头命中分子方面显著优于先前方法。结合快速搜索工作流程后，计算时间减少了数量级，同时为所有查询分子返回命中结果，能够搜索传统暴力搜索无法处理的大型分子库。

Conclusion: VoxCap解决了传统药效团虚拟筛选的扩展性和生成性限制，通过基于体素的生成模型实现了高效的新分子设计和快速搜索，为药物发现提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD) relies on making use of known binders to a protein target to find structurally diverse molecules similarly likely to bind. This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.

Motivation: "甜甜圈"社会与地球边界框架已成为评估环境和社会可持续性的流行框架，但需要有效方法寻找符合该框架的政策参数

Method: 使用随机森林分类器寻找符合"甜甜圈"边界的政策参数，使用强化学习（Q学习）在参数空间中识别最优政策轨迹

Conclusion: 概念验证成功，下一步是将这些方法应用于更复杂的生态宏观经济模型

Abstract: The 'Doughnut' of social and planetary boundaries has emerged as a popular framework for assessing environmental and social sustainability. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept analysis that shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut. First, we show how ML methods can be used to find policy parameters that are consistent with 'living within the Doughnut'. Second, we show how a reinforcement learning agent can identify the optimal trajectory towards desired policies in the parameter space. The approaches we test, which include a Random Forest Classifier and $Q$-learning, are frugal ML methods that are able to find policy parameter combinations that achieve both environmental and social sustainability. The next step is the application of these methods to a more complex ecological macroeconomic model.

TL;DR: PIBNet：基于物理启发的图神经网络，用于高效近似边界元法中的多散射问题解迹，在多个数据集上超越现有方法并具有更好的泛化能力。

Motivation: 边界元法（BEM）在求解无界均匀域中的多散射问题时，需要先求解边界积分方程获得解迹，这是主要计算瓶颈。需要开发学习方法来近似解迹以提高计算效率。

Method: 提出PIBNet：1）采用物理启发的基于图的策略来高效建模障碍物及其长程相互作用；2）引入新颖的多尺度图神经网络架构来模拟多散射现象。

Conclusion: PIBNet为边界元法中的解迹近似提供了一种有效的学习框架，显著提高了多散射问题的计算效率，并具有良好的可扩展性和泛化性能。

Abstract: The boundary element method (BEM) provides an efficient numerical framework for solving multiple scattering problems in unbounded homogeneous domains, since it reduces the discretization to the domain boundaries, thereby condensing the computational complexity. The procedure first consists in determining the solution trace on the boundaries of the domain by solving a boundary integral equation, after which the volumetric solution can be recovered at low computational cost with a boundary integral representation. As the first step of the BEM represents the main computational bottleneck, we introduce PIBNet, a learning-based approach designed to approximate the solution trace. The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently. Then, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering. To train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems. The results indicate that our approach not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods on the considered tasks but also exhibits superior generalization to settings with an increased number of obstacles. github.com/ENSTA-U2IS-AI/pibnet

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注Thurstone模型的参数估计和不确定性量化，而本文旨在解决这类模型的基本假设检验问题，特别是最小最大假设检验。

Method: 引入广义成对比较模型与Thurstone模型类之间的分离距离概念，基于观测图拓扑推导测试阈值上下界，使用反向鞅技术构建假设检验和置信区间，采用信息论方法推导最小最大下界。

Result: 对于完全观测图的特殊情况，测试阈值按Θ((nk)^{-1/2})缩放；建立了时间一致的I类和II类误差概率界；在合成和真实数据集上验证了结果。

Conclusion: 提出了一个完整的假设检验框架，能够有效判断成对比较数据是否符合给定的Thurstone模型，为模型选择提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: In this work, we develop a hypothesis testing framework to determine whether pairwise comparison data is generated by an underlying \emph{generalized Thurstone model} $\mathcal{T}_F$ for a given choice function $F$. While prior work has predominantly focused on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for such models, we address the fundamental problem of minimax hypothesis testing for $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $Θ((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods. Finally, we validate our results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征融合方法通常在最终输出层结合结构特征和语义特征，这种后期融合可能无法充分利用两种信息的协同作用。本研究旨在探索在Transformer中间层注入辅助结构特征是否更有效。

Method: 提出SFL Transformer模型，采用Contextual Gating机制（Intermediate SFL），在BERT编码器堆栈的隐藏状态序列中直接融合低维结构特征，而不是在最终输出层进行特征融合。

Result: 在基于UMAP降维的歌词嵌入二元分类任务中，SFL Transformer达到0.9910的准确率和宏F1分数，优于之前SFL模型的0.9894。同时保持高可靠性：预期校准误差仅0.0081，对数损失0.0489。

Conclusion: 在Transformer中间层注入辅助结构特征是最有效的特征融合策略，能够协同结合结构和语义信息，创建具有卓越判别能力和高保真概率估计的模型。

Abstract: This study introduces a significant architectural advancement in feature fusion for lyrical content classification by integrating auxiliary structural features directly into the self-attention mechanism of a pre-trained Transformer. I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489). This work validates the hypothesis that injecting auxiliary context mid-stack is the most effective means of synergistically combining structural and semantic information, creating a model with both superior discriminative power and high-fidelity probability estimates.

Conclusion: 通过数据分块去相关的方法，成功解决了自相关数据的高斯过程回归计算效率问题，在保持预测性能的同时实现了计算加速，为处理时间序列等自相关数据提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of how to speed up computation for Gaussian process models trained on autocorrelated data. The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.

Motivation: 工业AI应用面临两大瓶颈：高质量数据稀缺和黑盒模型缺乏可解释性，这在航空航天等安全敏感领域尤为关键。需要开发可信赖的AI系统，将工程领域知识直接嵌入架构中。

Method: 1) 三阶段物理增强数据合成：差异化噪声注入、硬物理约束强制、参数间关系保持；2) 嵌套优化策略：符号回归探索方程结构，差分进化优化参数，混合全局-局部优化精炼参数；3) 从仅32个实验样本出发，构建可解释本构方程。

Abstract: The industrial adoption of Artificial Intelligence for Engineering (AI4E) faces two fundamental bottlenecks: scarce high-quality data and the lack of interpretability in black-box models-particularly critical in safety-sensitive sectors like aerospace. We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency. This equation not only provides quantitative predictions but also delivers explicit physical insight, revealing how thermal, geometric, and metallurgical mechanisms couple to drive cracking-thereby advancing engineers' cognitive understanding of the process. Furthermore, the constitutive equation serves as a multi-functional tool for process optimization and high-fidelity virtual data generation, enabling accuracy improvements in other data-driven models. Our approach provides a general blueprint for developing trustworthy AI systems that embed engineering domain knowledge directly into their architecture, enabling reliable adoption in high-stakes industrial applications where data is limited but physical understanding is available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列预测中，数据的主导频率会随频谱分布变化而漂移，传统固定专家数量的MoE模型难以适应这种变化，导致频率覆盖不平衡问题：专家太少会忽略关键信息，太多会引入噪声。

Method: 提出Ada-MoGE自适应高斯混合专家模型，通过整合频谱强度和频率响应来自适应确定专家数量，确保与输入数据的频率分布对齐。使用高斯带通滤波平滑分解频域特征，避免直接频带截断引入噪声。

Conclusion: Ada-MoGE通过自适应确定专家数量解决了传统MoE的频率覆盖不平衡问题，使用高斯滤波优化特征表示，在保持参数效率的同时实现了优异的预测性能。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasts are widely used, such as industrial, transportation and financial forecasts. However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts. Additionally, to prevent noise introduction from direct band truncation, we employ Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose the frequency domain features, further optimizing the feature representation. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmarks with only 0.2 million parameters.

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a critical task in computational intelligence. While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis. Extensive experiments on eight public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to learn discriminative semantic invariance by contrasting different views of the same graph that share critical topological patterns. However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.

TL;DR: 提出一种任务驱动的监督式多模态联邦特征提取方法，解决多模态数据回归中的特征提取问题，应对非IID数据、多模态信息融合和灾难性遗忘三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中多模态数据回归面临的三个核心挑战：1) 有限且非独立同分布数据；2) 多模态信息的有效提取与融合；3) 模型学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出任务驱动的监督式多模态联邦特征提取方法，整合多模态信息提取和对比学习机制。采用多约束学习框架，包括均方误差损失保证回归精度，互信息保留约束保持任务相关信息，对称KL散度约束实现多模态特征提取、融合与对齐，以及模型间对比约束缓解非IID场景下的表示漂移和灾难性遗忘。

Result: 实验结果表明，与经典特征提取技术相比，该方法在下游回归任务上实现了更显著的性能提升，验证了其在模拟和真实数据分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多模态联邦学习中的关键挑战，通过多约束框架确保特征提取过程始终以提高下游回归任务性能为中心，在非IID场景下实现了有效的特征提取、融合和模型稳定性。

Abstract: This study focuses on the feature extraction problem in multi-modal data regression. To address three core challenges in real-world scenarios: limited and non-IID data, effective extraction and fusion of multi-modal information, and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting in model learning, a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed. The method integrates multi-modal information extraction and contrastive learning mechanisms, and can adapt to different neural network structures as the latent mapping functions for data of each modality. It supports each client to independently learn low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, and can flexibly control the degree of retention of effective information about the response variable in the predictive variables within the low-dimensional features through parameter tuning. The multi-constraint learning framework constructed by the method guarantees regression accuracy using Mean Squared Error loss. Through the synergistic effect of mutual information preservation constraint, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, and inter-model contrastive constraint, it achieves the retention of task-related information, the extraction, fusion, and alignment of multi-modal features, and the mitigation of representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID scenarios, respectively. This ensures that the feature extraction process always centers on improving the performance of downstream regression tasks. Experimental results from simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more significant performance improvement on downstream regression tasks compared with classical feature extraction techniques.

TL;DR: LLMs表现出利他倾向但存在"美德信号差距"：模型隐含认知与自我报告无法预测实际行为，且系统性地高估自身利他水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否表现出利他倾向，并检验其隐含关联和自我报告是否能预测实际的利他行为，借鉴人类社会心理学方法评估LLM的行为一致性

Method: 采用多方法研究设计，测试24个前沿LLM：1) 内隐联想测试测量隐含利他偏见；2) 强制二元选择任务测量行为利他；3) 自我评估量表测量显性利他信念

Result: 1) 所有模型都显示强烈的隐含亲利他偏见；2) 模型行为比随机更利他但变异大；3) 隐含关联无法预测行为；4) 模型系统性高估自身利他水平（77.5% vs 65.6%），75%模型存在"美德信号差距"

Conclusion: 提出"校准差距"作为标准化对齐指标，仅有12.5%模型实现高亲社会行为和准确自我认知的理想组合，强调模型校准对行为可预测性和一致性的重要性

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

TL;DR: GraphTCL：一个结合图神经网络结构嵌入与持久同调拓扑嵌入的双视角对比学习框架，用于提升图分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络虽然能有效捕捉局部结构模式，但往往忽略对图表示学习至关重要的全局拓扑特征。需要一种能够整合结构信息和拓扑信息的方法来提升图表示质量。

Method: 提出GraphTCL双视角对比学习框架：1）结构视角：使用GNNs提取局部结构嵌入；2）拓扑视角：使用持久同调提取全局拓扑嵌入；3）通过跨视角对比损失对齐这两个互补视角，增强表示学习。

Result: 在TU和OGB分子图等基准数据集上的大量实验表明，GraphTCL在分类性能上持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 拓扑感知的对比学习对于推进图表示方法具有重要意义，GraphTCL通过整合结构和拓扑信息有效提升了图分类性能。

Abstract: Graph classification has gained significant attention due to its applications in chemistry, social networks, and bioinformatics. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they often overlook global topological features that are critical for robust representation learning. In this work, we propose GraphTCL, a dual-view contrastive learning framework that integrates structural embeddings from GNNs with topological embeddings derived from persistent homology. By aligning these complementary views through a cross-view contrastive loss, our method enhances representation quality and improves classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including TU and OGB molecular graphs, demonstrate that GraphTCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This study highlights the importance of topology-aware contrastive learning for advancing graph representation methods.

TL;DR: 研究四种定价算法在三种双寡头市场模型和不同需求冲击下的竞争行为，发现强化学习算法在稳定需求下维持超竞争价格，DDPG最具合谋倾向，市场结构和需求不确定性对算法竞争结果有重要影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主定价算法日益影响数字市场竞争，但其在现实需求条件下的行为尚未得到充分研究。需要分析算法、市场结构和随机需求如何共同影响竞争结果，为相关政策讨论提供依据

Method: 使用四种定价算法（Q-Learning、PSO、Double DQN、DDPG），在三种经典双寡头模型（Logit、Hotelling、Linear）下，通过自回归过程创建不同需求冲击机制，利用利润和价格合谋指数分析算法交互行为

Result: 强化学习算法在稳定需求下常维持超竞争价格，DDPG最具合谋倾向；需求冲击影响各异：Logit市场性能显著下降，Hotelling市场保持稳定，Linear市场出现冲击诱导的利润膨胀；算法相对排名在不同环境中保持一致

Conclusion: 市场结构和需求不确定性对算法竞争结果具有关键重要性，这些发现为自主定价行为的政策讨论提供了重要参考，强调了在监管算法定价时需要考虑市场特性和需求波动因素

Abstract: Autonomous pricing algorithms are increasingly influencing competition in digital markets; however, their behavior under realistic demand conditions remains largely unexamined. This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments. These results underscore the critical importance of market structure and demand uncertainty in shaping algorithmic competition, while also contributing to the evolving policy discussions surrounding autonomous pricing behavior.

TL;DR: CLEF：一种利用临床风险评分进行自适应负对加权的对比学习方法，用于单导联心电图基础模型预训练，在多项临床任务中优于现有自监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心电图基础模型预训练方法未充分利用临床元数据中的领域知识，限制了模型对临床相关差异的捕捉能力。

Method: 提出临床引导对比学习（CLEF），利用已建立的临床风险评分自适应加权负对，将心电图嵌入相似性与临床有意义的患者差异对齐，并处理缺失元数据。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上预训练三个规模的基础模型，在18个临床分类和回归任务中，CLEF在分类任务上平均AUROC至少提升2.6%，回归任务上平均MAE至少降低3.2%，优于5个基础模型基线和3个自监督算法。

Conclusion: CLEF通过整合临床元数据实现了更准确、可扩展的单导联心电图分析，推进远程健康监测，其性能可与监督学习方法媲美。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool in cardiovascular health. Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner. Overall, CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring. Code and pretrained CLEF models are available at: github.com/Nokia-Bell-Labs/ecg-foundation-model.

TL;DR: 研究探讨公平性约束如何影响机器学习模型的可解释性，发现提升公平性会显著改变特征重要性排序，且在不同群体间变化方式不同


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域需要可信的机器学习模型，要求良好的预测性能、公平性和可解释性。虽然已知提升公平性会影响预测性能，但公平性改进如何影响可解释性（临床信任的关键要素）尚不清楚。临床医生可能不愿意依赖公平性约束后解释发生变化的模型

Method: 通过偏置缓解技术增强公平性，研究其如何重塑基于Shapley的特征排序。量化应用公平性约束后特征重要性排名的变化，使用三个数据集：儿童尿路感染风险、直接抗凝剂出血风险和累犯风险。评估多个模型类别在Shapley排序稳定性方面的表现

Result: 提高跨种族亚组的模型公平性会显著改变特征重要性排名，有时在不同群体间以不同方式变化。公平性约束对可解释性有实质性影响

Conclusion: 需要在模型评估中联合考虑准确性、公平性和可解释性，而不是孤立地评估这些指标。公平性改进会改变模型解释，这对临床信任有重要影响

Abstract: Trustworthy machine learning in healthcare requires strong predictive performance, fairness, and explanations. While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups. These results highlight the need to jointly consider accuracy, fairness, and explainability in model assessment rather than in isolation.

TL;DR: OSAE通过严格排序特征维度和确定性使用所有维度，解决了稀疏自编码器特征不一致的问题，提高了特征学习的可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在神经网络可解释性中被广泛应用，但学习到的特征在不同随机种子和超参数设置下存在不一致性，这影响了特征学习的可靠性和可重复性。

Method: 提出有序稀疏自编码器(OSAE)，扩展了Matryoshka SAE：1)建立严格的潜在特征排序；2)确定性使用每个特征维度，避免先前嵌套SAE方法中的采样近似。

Result: 理论上证明OSAE在稀疏字典学习设置中解决了排列不可识别性问题；在Gemma2-2B和Pythia-70M上的实证研究表明，相比Matryoshka基线，OSAE提高了特征一致性。

Conclusion: OSAE通过消除特征排序的不确定性，为稀疏自编码器提供了更可靠和一致的特征表示，有助于改善神经网络可解释性研究的可重复性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been widely used for interpretability of neural networks, but their learned features often vary across seeds and hyperparameter settings. We introduce Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (OSAE), which extend Matryoshka SAEs by (1) establishing a strict ordering of latent features and (2) deterministically using every feature dimension, avoiding the sampling-based approximations of prior nested SAE methods. Theoretically, we show that OSAEs resolve permutation non-identifiability in settings of sparse dictionary learning where solutions are unique (up to natural symmetries). Empirically on Gemma2-2B and Pythia-70M, we show that OSAEs can help improve consistency compared to Matryoshka baselines.

TL;DR: TokenPowerBench：首个轻量级可扩展的LLM推理功耗基准测试工具，支持GPU/节点/系统级功耗测量，无需专用功率计，可分析预填充和解码阶段的能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM服务每天处理数十亿查询，推理阶段占90%以上总功耗，但现有基准测试主要关注训练/微调或推理性能，缺乏对推理功耗的测量和分析支持。

Method: 设计包含三个组件的基准测试：1）声明式配置接口（模型选择、提示集、推理引擎）；2）无需专用功率计的测量层（GPU/节点/系统级功耗）；3）阶段对齐的指标管道（将能耗归因于每个请求的预填充和解码阶段）。

Result: 在四个最广泛使用的模型系列（Llama、Falcon、Qwen、Mistral）上评估，覆盖从10亿参数到前沿规模的Llama3-405B模型，支持用户快速评估不同设置对每令牌能耗的影响。

Conclusion: TokenPowerBench作为开源工具发布，帮助用户测量功耗、预测运营成本、满足可持续发展目标，填补了LLM推理功耗基准测试的空白。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) services now answer billions of queries per day, and industry reports show that inference, not training, accounts for more than 90% of total power consumption. However, existing benchmarks focus on either training/fine-tuning or performance of inference and provide little support for power consumption measurement and analysis of inference. We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics. We evaluate TokenPowerBench on four of the most widely used model series (Llama, Falcon, Qwen, and Mistral). Our experiments cover from 1 billion parameters up to the frontier-scale Llama3-405B model. Furthermore, we release TokenPowerBench as open source to help users to measure power consumption, forecast operating expenses, and meet sustainability targets when deploying LLM services.

Abstract: Sperm whales communicate in short sequences of clicks known as codas. We present WhAM (Whale Acoustics Model), the first transformer-based model capable of generating synthetic sperm whale codas from any audio prompt. WhAM is built by finetuning VampNet, a masked acoustic token model pretrained on musical audio, using 10k coda recordings collected over the past two decades. Through iterative masked token prediction, WhAM generates high-fidelity synthetic codas that preserve key acoustic features of the source recordings. We evaluate WhAM's synthetic codas using Fréchet Audio Distance and through perceptual studies with expert marine biologists. On downstream classification tasks including rhythm, social unit, and vowel classification, WhAM's learned representations achieve strong performance, despite being trained for generation rather than classification.

Conclusion: InstructLR框架有效解决了低资源语言高质量指令数据集生成的问题，为支持非洲语言等低资源语言的文本生成和聊天界面提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Effective text generation and chat interfaces for low-resource languages (LRLs) remain a challenge for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to support. This is mainly due to the difficulty of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, a limitation prevalent in the languages spoken across the African continent and other regions. Current approaches, such as automated translation and synthetic data generation, frequently yield outputs that lack fluency or even orthographic consistency. In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer. Drawing inspiration from benchmarks such as MMLU in task definition, InstructLR has facilitated the creation of three multi-domain instruction benchmarks: ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, and FulfuldeInstruct-50k.

We also propose \textit{CT-RS-q}, a risk-sensitive q-learning algorithm based on a novel martingale characterization approach. Finally, we run a simulation study on a dynamic portfolio selection problem and illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Our goal is to establish the improved efficiency and performance gains achieved by integrating online model selection methods into reinforcement learning training procedures. We examine the theoretical characterizations that are effective for identifying the right configuration in practice, and address three practical criteria from a theoretical perspective: 1) Efficient resource allocation, 2) Adaptation under non-stationary dynamics, and 3) Training stability across different seeds. Our theoretical results are accompanied by empirical evidence from various model selection tasks in reinforcement learning, including neural architecture selection, step-size selection, and self model selection.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly influence safety-critical aspects of society, from medical diagnosis to autonomous mobility, making uncertainty awareness a central requirement for trustworthy AI. We present a photonic Bayesian machine that leverages the inherent randomness of chaotic light sources to enable uncertainty reasoning within the framework of Bayesian Neural Networks.

We use the system for simultaneous classification and out-of-domain detection of blood cell microscope images and demonstrate reasoning between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The photonic Bayesian machine removes the bottleneck of pseudo random number generation in digital systems, minimizes the cost of sampling for probabilistic models, and thus enables high-speed trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Inferring the phylogenetic relationships among a sample of organisms is a fundamental problem in modern biology. While distance-based hierarchical clustering algorithms achieved early success on this task, these have been supplanted by Bayesian and maximum likelihood search procedures based on complex models of molecular evolution. In this work we describe minimal neural network architectures that can approximate classic phylogenetic distance functions and the properties required to learn distances under a variety of molecular evolutionary models. In contrast to model-based inference (and recently proposed model-free convolutional and transformer networks), these architectures have a small computational footprint and are scalable to large numbers of taxa and molecular characters. The learned distance functions generalize well and, given an appropriate training dataset, achieve results comparable to state-of-the art inference methods.

### [161] [Limitations of Membership Queries in Testable Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02279)
*Jane Lange,Mingda Qiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明在可测试学习模型中，成员查询(MQ)无法显著降低时间复杂性，无法超越仅使用样本的分布特定学习算法。通过将布尔概念类的基于样本的证伪归约到带查询的可测试学习，表明带查询的可测试学习算法不可能比最佳PAC学习器更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在可测试学习模型中，成员查询(MQ)是否能为学习任务带来显著的时间效率提升。尽管MQ在传统学习设置中常能加速学习过程，但在Rubinfeld和Vasilyan提出的可测试学习模型中，需要探究MQ是否仍能提供类似的优势。

Method: 1) 提出从布尔概念类的基于样本证伪到带查询的可测试学习(TL-Q)的一般归约；2) 利用[KL18]中从学习到证伪的归约来获得TL-Q的下界；3) 定义一类"统计"MQ算法，涵盖许多已知的分布特定MQ学习器；4) 证明这类TL-Q算法蕴含高效的统计查询证伪和学习算法。

Result: 1) 在可测试学习模型中，成员查询无法将时间复杂性降低到超越仅使用样本的分布特定学习算法；2) 相对于概念类和分布族，没有m样本TL-Q算法能比最佳m样本PAC学习器更高效；3) 结合已知的SQ维度下界，表明许多高效的成员查询学习器无法被转化为可测试学习器。

Conclusion: 在可测试学习框架下，成员查询无法提供超越传统样本学习的时间效率优势。这意味着许多已知的高效分布特定MQ学习算法无法被转化为可测试学习器，揭示了可测试学习模型与标准学习模型之间的根本差异。

Abstract: Membership queries (MQ) often yield speedups for learning tasks, particularly in the distribution-specific setting. We show that in the \emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal.
  We give a general reduction from sample-based \emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner.
  Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries. We show that TL-Q algorithms in this class imply efficient statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms. Thus, combined with known SQ dimension lower bounds, our results imply that these efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable.

*Max W. Shen,Ewa Nowara,Michael Maser,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了对称无关模型学习对称性的速度与效果，提出了衡量等变性误差的原则性方法，发现在3D旋转等变性任务中，模型能快速学习到对称性（1k-10k步内误差≤2%），且学习对称性比主预测任务更容易。非等变模型可能因计算效率更高而获得更低的测试损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数据增强被广泛用于训练对称无关模型，但模型学习尊重对称性的速度和效果仍不清楚。研究者希望量化模型学习对称性的过程，并理解等变性学习与主任务学习之间的关系。

Method: 提出了一个原则性的等变性误差度量方法（对于凸损失函数，计算总损失中由于对称性不完美导致的百分比）。实证研究聚焦于高维分子任务（流匹配、力场预测、体素去噪）上的3D旋转等变性，分析模型在不同训练阶段的表现。

Result: 模型能快速学习3D旋转等变性，在1k-10k训练步内将等变性误差降低到≤2%的测试损失。学习3D旋转等变性比主预测任务更容易，具有更平滑、条件更好的损失景观。非等变模型在整个训练过程中的损失惩罚很小，可能比等变模型获得更低的每GPU小时测试损失。

Conclusion: 对称无关模型能快速有效地学习3D旋转等变性，但等变模型需要缩小"效率差距"才能在实际计算成本下优于非等变模型。研究还探讨了相对等变性误差、学习梯度和模型参数之间的关系。

Abstract: While data augmentation is widely used to train symmetry-agnostic models, it remains unclear how quickly and effectively they learn to respect symmetries. We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\leq$2\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters.

Motivation: 研究检索增强模型在概念漂移的流式监督学习中的应用，解决传统在线学习方法在处理非平稳环境时可能面临的挑战。

Method: 提出RAM-OL方法，扩展随机梯度下降，维护过去样本的小缓冲区，在隐藏表示空间中检索当前输入的最近邻，联合更新当前样本和检索到的邻居。包含朴素回放和门控回放两种变体。

Result: 在强周期漂移数据流上，RAM-OL将预序准确性提高了约7个百分点，显著减少了随机种子间的方差；在噪声航空数据流上，门控变体与纯在线基线表现相当。

Conclusion: 检索增强记忆是概念漂移下在线学习的实用且鲁棒的工具，能够有效利用过去相关数据，提高模型在非平稳环境中的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented models couple parametric predictors with non-parametric memories, but their use in streaming supervised learning with concept drift is not well understood. We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了多种统计和机器学习模型在预测波士顿地铁使用量和MBTA系统延误次数方面的表现，发现日期特征比天气数据对预测准确性更有帮助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波士顿MBTA公共交通系统经常面临延误和客流量波动的问题，影响运营效率和乘客满意度。为了更好理解这一现象，需要开发有效的预测方法来预测地铁使用量和系统延误次数。

Method: 研究评估了10个统计和机器学习模型来预测次日地铁使用量，对于延误次数预测则扩展到11个模型（包括自激点过程模型）。考虑了日期、季节、天气等多种影响因素，通过特征选择和RMSE评估模型准确性。

Result: 研究发现提供日期或季节数据比天气数据对预测准确性更有帮助，实际上天气数据通常会降低模型性能，表明模型容易过拟合。自激点过程模型被独特应用于MBTA延误建模。

Conclusion: 日期和季节特征是预测公共交通使用量和延误的关键因素，而天气数据可能引入噪声导致过拟合。该研究为MBTA系统运营优化提供了实用的预测方法。

Abstract: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is the main public transit provider in Boston, operating multiple means of transport, including trains, subways, and buses. However, the system often faces delays and fluctuations in ridership volume, which negatively affect efficiency and passenger satisfaction. To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit.

TL;DR: SpecPV：一种针对长上下文生成的自推测解码方法，通过部分KV状态快速验证和周期性全验证，在长上下文场景下实现高达6倍的解码加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代码生成、深度推理和长文档理解等任务的需求增长，长上下文生成成为LLM的关键能力。推测解码是加速生成的最直接有效方法之一，但随着上下文长度增加，验证过程成为主要瓶颈。

Method: 提出SpecPV自推测解码方法：1）使用部分键值状态（KV）进行快速验证；2）定期应用全验证以消除累积误差。该方法遵循"草稿-验证"范式，但优化了验证过程。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准测试和模型（包括LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3系列）上验证，SpecPV相比标准自回归解码实现了高达6倍的解码加速，且性能下降很小。

Conclusion: SpecPV通过优化验证过程有效解决了长上下文生成中推测解码的瓶颈问题，显著加速了生成过程，为长上下文LLM应用提供了实用的加速方案。

Abstract: Growing demands from tasks like code generation, deep reasoning, and long-document understanding have made long-context generation a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs). Speculative decoding is one of the most direct and effective approaches for accelerating generation. It follows a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes several candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series. Experimental results show that SpecPV achieves up to 6x decoding speedup over standard autoregressive decoding with minor degradation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线联邦强化学习方法在面对混合质量数据（即不同客户端收集的数据质量差异大）时性能显著下降，需要新的方法来克服这一限制。

Method: 提出基于投票的离线联邦强化学习框架FOVA，利用投票机制在本地策略评估中识别高回报动作，减轻低质量行为的影响；基于优势加权回归构建一致的本地和全局训练目标。

Result: 理论分析表明FOVA学习的策略相比行为策略有严格改进；实验证明在广泛使用的基准测试中，FOVA相比现有基线方法有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: FOVA框架有效解决了离线联邦强化学习中混合质量数据的问题，通过投票机制和一致训练目标实现了更好的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), a marriage of federated learning and offline reinforcement learning, has attracted increasing interest recently. Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of our proposed algorithm over existing baselines on widely used benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出GPOMDP算法，一种基于梯度的直接优化策略性能方法，用于部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程（POMDPs）。该算法通过单一样本路径估计平均奖励梯度，仅需一个参数β控制偏差-方差权衡，且无需了解底层状态信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程（POMDPs）中，直接优化策略性能面临挑战。现有方法通常需要了解底层状态信息或产生高方差估计。本文旨在开发一种更实用、更稳定的梯度估计方法，能够在仅观察动作和奖励的情况下优化策略。

Method: 提出GPOMDP算法，这是一种类似REINFORCE的算法，用于估计随机策略参数化下平均奖励的梯度近似。算法特点：1）仅需马尔可夫链的单个样本路径；2）仅使用一个自由参数β∈[0,1)，用于偏差-方差权衡；3）无需了解底层状态信息。算法收敛性得到证明，并可与共轭梯度法结合寻找局部最优解。

Result: 证明了GPOMDP算法的收敛性，展示了算法产生的梯度估计可用于共轭梯度过程，寻找平均奖励的局部最优解。算法的主要优势在于其简单性和实用性：单一样本路径、单一可解释参数、无需状态知识。

Conclusion: GPOMDP为POMDPs中的策略优化提供了一种有效的梯度估计方法，平衡了偏差和方差，具有实际应用价值。算法框架简洁，可与优化方法结合实现策略性能的直接优化。

Abstract: This paper discusses theoretical and experimental aspects of gradient-based approaches to the direct optimization of policy performance in controlled POMDPs. We introduce GPOMDP, a REINFORCE-like algorithm for estimating an approximation to the gradient of the average reward as a function of the parameters of a stochastic policy. The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires only a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain, it uses only one free parameter $β\in [0,1)$, which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off, and it requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP and show how the gradient estimates produced by GPOMDP can be used in a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local optima of the average reward.

TL;DR: ESACT是一种端到端稀疏加速器，通过局部相似性预测注意力稀疏性，在Transformer中实现高效稀疏计算，显著降低计算开销并提升能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型计算成本高，阻碍硬件高效部署。现有稀疏加速器主要利用注意力中的行内稀疏性，很少考虑行间稀疏性，且依赖昂贵的全局相似性估计，限制了加速效果。

Method: 提出ESACT端到端稀疏加速器，核心是SPLS（局部相似性稀疏预测）机制，利用HLog量化在QK生成前准确预测局部注意力稀疏性，实现所有Transformer组件的稀疏计算。包含三项架构创新支持硬件实现。

Result: 在26个基准测试中，SPLS将总计算量减少52.03%，精度损失小于1%。ESACT实现端到端能效3.29 TOPS/W，注意力级能效比SOTA加速器SpAtten和Sanger分别提升2.95倍和2.26倍。

Conclusion: 局部相似性可实现低开销的端到端稀疏加速，ESACT通过SPLS机制和架构创新，在保持精度的同时显著提升Transformer计算能效，为计算密集型Transformer的高效硬件部署提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers, composed of QKV generation, attention computation, and FFNs,
  have become the dominant model across various domains due to their outstanding performance.
  However, their high computational cost hinders efficient hardware deployment.
  Sparsity offers a promising solution,
  yet most existing accelerators exploit only intra-row sparsity in attention,
  while few consider inter-row sparsity.
  Approaches leveraging inter-row sparsity often rely on costly global similarity estimation,
  which diminishes the acceleration benefits of sparsity,
  and typically apply sparsity to only one or two transformer components.
  Through careful analysis of the attention distribution and computation flow,
  we observe that local similarity allows end-to-end sparse acceleration with lower computational overhead.
  Motivated by this observation, we propose ESACT,
  an end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive Transformers.
  ESACT centers on the Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism,
  which leverages HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity prior to QK generation,
  achieving efficient sparsity across all transformer components.
  To support efficient hardware realization, we introduce three architectural innovations.
  Experimental results on 26 benchmarks demonstrate that
  SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss.
  ESACT achieves an end-to-end energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W,
  and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95x and 2.26x over
  SOTA attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively.

Conclusion: 动态配置路边停车位能有效缓解交通拥堵，提出的多智能体强化学习框架具有可扩展性，能适应大规模路网，在减少旅行时间损失的同时保持停车便利性

Abstract: With increased travelling needs more than ever, traffic congestion has become a major concern in most urban areas. Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne. Our experiments show that the proposed framework could reduce the average travel time loss of vehicles significantly, reaching upto 47%, with a negligible increase in the walking distance for parking.

Motivation: 研究各种数据中心化策略（数据剪枝、合成数据生成、跨模型蒸馏、RLHF、基于难度的采样）对大规模神经模型训练效率的影响，特别是为什么某些策略（如自生成合成数据）无法提供实质性改进。

Method: 将数据筛选形式化为重新加权采样分布，并将其效果映射到数据诱导算子的特征结构上。通过理论分析静态剪枝和时间相关数据筛选的数学特性。

Result: 1. 静态剪枝诱导有界算子，无法改变谱尾指数，只能提供有限区域改进，不能改变渐近神经缩放。2. 理想的时间相关数据筛选（能跟踪谱残差并连续重新归一化尾部）可证明加速学习，但实际系统只能近似这种行为。

Conclusion: 数据筛选策略的有效性取决于其改变数据分布谱特性的能力。静态方法有限，而动态跟踪数据谱特性的方法有潜力加速学习，但实际实现需要近似理想行为。

Abstract: Large-scale neural models are increasingly trained with data pruning, synthetic data generation, cross-model distillation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and difficulty-based sampling. While several of these data-centric strategies reliably improve training efficiency and downstream performance, others fail to provide meaningful gains -- most notably self-generated synthetic data, which often increases dataset volume without enhancing model capability.
  We formalize data curation as reweighting the sampling distribution and map its effect onto the eigenstructure of the data-induced operator. Our first main result shows that \textbf{static pruning induces a bounded operator and therefore cannot change the spectral tail exponent}; it provides at most finite-region improvements and cannot alter asymptotic neural scaling. Our second result analyzes \textbf{time-dependent data curation}, showing that an ideal oracle capable of tracking spectral residuals and continuously re-normalizing the tail can provably accelerate learning -- although practical systems can only approximate this behavior.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning aims to train an agent deployed in the target environment, leveraging both a limited target domain dataset and a source domain dataset with (possibly) sufficient data coverage. Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \textbf{\underline{D}}ynamics- and \textbf{\underline{V}}alue-aligned \textbf{\underline{D}}ata \textbf{\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method. We design a range of dynamics shift settings, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, as well as in challenging extremely low-data settings where the target domain dataset contains only 5,000 transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms prior strong baselines and delivers exceptional performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM智能体在长上下文环境中表现不稳定，任务性能和拒绝有害请求的能力会随上下文长度、类型和位置发生意外变化，即使支持百万token的模型在10万token时性能也会严重下降，揭示了长上下文智能体潜在的安全问题。


<details>

Motivation: 随着LLM支持更长上下文窗口和工具调用能力，现有研究主要关注长上下文提示的评估，而智能体设置（特别是能力和安全方面）相对未被探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过评估LLM智能体在不同上下文长度、类型和位置下的表现，分析任务性能和拒绝有害请求的行为变化，特别关注支持1M-2M token上下文窗口的模型。

Result: 发现LLM智能体对上下文敏感，性能在10万token时已严重下降（下降超过50%）。拒绝率变化不可预测：GPT-4.1-nano从~5%增加到~40%，而Grok 4 Fast从~80%下降到~10%（在20万token时）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了长上下文智能体操作中的潜在安全问题，并对当前评估LLM智能体在长多步任务中安全性的指标和范式提出了质疑，发现智能体在能力和安全性能上与先前LLM评估存在显著差异。

Abstract: Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.

Abstract: In the face of accelerating global urbanization and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, highresolution urban rainfall monitoring is crucial for building resilient smart cities. Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.

TL;DR: 提出DROCO算法，解决跨域离线强化学习中训练时和测试时对动态变化的双重鲁棒性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域离线强化学习方法主要关注训练时鲁棒性（处理训练数据中的动态变化），但忽略了实际部署时对测试时动态扰动的鲁棒性。研究发现，当目标域数据有限时，跨域离线RL策略在动态扰动下表现脆弱。

Method: 提出鲁棒跨域Bellman算子（RCB），增强测试时对动态扰动的鲁棒性，同时保持对分布外动态转移的保守性。引入动态值惩罚和Huber损失技术，形成DROCO算法。

Result: 在各种动态变化场景下的广泛实验表明，DROCO优于强基线方法，并展现出对动态扰动增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DROCO算法成功解决了跨域离线强化学习中训练时和测试时的双重鲁棒性问题，为实际部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Single-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) often suffers from limited data coverage, while cross-domain offline RL handles this issue by leveraging additional data from other domains with dynamics shifts. However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{RO}bust \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.

Conclusion: 提出了一种高效的可微优化层梯度计算方法，显著降低计算成本，并发布了开源Python库FFOLayer

Abstract: Differentiable optimization layers enable learning systems to make decisions by solving embedded optimization problems. However, computing gradients via implicit differentiation requires solving a linear system with Hessian terms, which is both compute- and memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the gradient using only first-order information. The key insight is to rewrite the differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and leverage recent advances in bilevel methods. Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees. We show that an approximate hypergradient can be computed using only first-order information in $\tilde{\oo}(1)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $\tilde{\oo}(δ^{-1}ε^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, which matches the best known rate for non-smooth non-convex optimization. Furthermore, we release an open-source Python library that can be easily adapted from existing solvers. Our code is available here: https://github.com/guaguakai/FFOLayer.

Conclusion: DMTFL算法通过个性化内容分发解决了无线VR传输的挑战，在保证理论性能的同时提升了用户体验质量。

Abstract: Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持冻结模型快速实验周期的同时显著降低运营成本，使先进的智能体系统在经济上对更广泛的应用具有可行性

Abstract: The world currently has an abundance of ideas for how to use new LLM agents, and developers seek to rapidly prototype and test new agentic designs. However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\textbf{2.5$\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \$0.059 to \$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\textbf{2$\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy. By reducing operational costs while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, our approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable for a broader range of applications.

Conclusion: FL模型通过可学习的CPD表示和ALS优化，实现了特征超参数的高效学习，显著提升了训练效率，为大规模核方法应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Many approximations were suggested to circumvent the cubic complexity of kernel-based algorithms, allowing their application to large-scale datasets. One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated model.

Motivation: 现有矩阵乘法内核（如cuBLAS、torch.matmul）虽然经过高度优化，但仍有改进空间。传统手动优化方法难以系统探索大规模配置空间，需要自动化方法来进一步提升性能。

Method: 使用大语言模型（LLMs）和强化学习（RL）相结合的系统，以CUDA执行速度作为RL奖励，自动优化半精度通用矩阵乘法（HGEMM）CUDA内核。系统在1000种配置上进行自动优化。

Result: 在离线模式下：相比torch.matmul平均提升22.0%；相比cuBLAS（最优布局配置）提升19.2%；相比cuBLASLt-heuristic提升16.8%；相比最具竞争力的cuBLASLt-AutoTuning提升11.4%。在服务器模式下（模拟实时推理）：提升进一步增加到28.7%、26.0%、22.4%和15.9%。

Conclusion: 即使是像HGEMM这样性能关键、经过深度优化的内核，通过LLM引导的RL自动化，在人类难以实现的大规模配置空间探索中，仍能获得显著性能提升。这展示了自动化优化在高性能计算领域的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose CUDA-L2, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically optimize Half-precision General Matrix Multiply (HGEMM) CUDA kernels. Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used {\it torch.matmul} to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt}. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0\% over {\it torch.matmul} on average; +19.2\% over {\it cuBLAS} using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8\% over {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, which queries {\it cuBLASLt} library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4\% over the most competitive {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from {\it cuBLASLt}'s suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7\%, +26.0\%, +22.4\%, and +15.9\% for {\it torch.matmul}, {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, and {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

TL;DR: GoRL框架通过将优化与生成解耦，使用可优化的潜在策略和条件生成解码器，在保持稳定性的同时实现高表达力，在连续控制任务中显著超越高斯策略和现有生成策略基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中存在一个持续的矛盾：易于优化的策略往往过于简单，无法表示复杂控制所需的多模态动作分布。高斯策略虽然提供可处理的似然和平滑梯度，但其单模态形式限制了表达力。而基于扩散或流匹配的生成策略虽然能建模丰富的多模态行为，但在在线RL中由于不可处理的似然和深度采样链中的噪声梯度传播而不稳定。

Method: 提出GoRL（生成在线强化学习）框架，基于"将优化与生成解耦"的结构原则。框架包含两部分：1）可优化的潜在策略（提供稳定优化），2）条件生成解码器（合成动作）。采用双时间尺度更新计划：潜在策略稳定学习，解码器逐步增加表达力，无需可处理的动作似然。

Result: 在一系列连续控制任务中，GoRL始终优于高斯策略和最近的生成策略基线。特别是在HopperStand任务中，达到870以上的归一化回报，是基线最强方法的3倍以上。

Conclusion: 将优化与生成分离为同时实现稳定性和高表达力的策略提供了一条实用路径，解决了强化学习中稳定优化与丰富表达之间的长期矛盾。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces a persistent tension: policies that are stable to optimize are often too simple to represent the multimodal action distributions needed for complex control. Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that separating optimization from generation provides a practical path to policies that are both stable and highly expressive.

TL;DR: HeatTransFormer：基于物理引导的Transformer架构，用于解决界面主导的扩散问题，特别是芯片-基板组装体中的瞬态热传导，能同时进行正向和逆向建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体器件中的热传递由芯片和基板组装体主导，其中有限芯片层产生的热量会耗散到热物理性质高得多的半无限基板中。这种不匹配会产生陡峭的界面温度梯度，使得瞬态热响应对界面高度敏感。传统数值求解器需要过度离散化来解决这些动态问题，而物理信息神经网络（PINNs）通常在材料界面附近表现出不稳定的收敛性和物理一致性丧失。

Method: 提出HeatTransFormer，一种用于界面主导扩散问题的物理引导Transformer架构。该框架集成了物理信息时空采样、模拟解析扩散解的拉普拉斯基激活函数，以及支持双向时空耦合的无掩码注意力机制。

Result: HeatTransFormer在应用于有限层和半无限基板配置时，能在界面处产生连贯的温度场。结合物理约束的逆向策略，仅使用外部测量就能可靠地同时识别三个未知热特性。

Conclusion: 这项工作表明，物理引导的Transformer架构为界面主导热系统中的正向和逆向建模提供了一个统一框架。

Abstract: Heat transfer in semiconductor devices is dominated by chip and substrate assemblies, where heat generated within a finite chip layer dissipates into a semi-infinite substrate with much higher thermophysical properties. This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.

Abstract: Transfer learning aims to optimize performance in a target task by learning from a related source problem. In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.

Conclusion: SeeNav-Agent框架通过双视角视觉提示和SRGPO强化微调，有效解决了VLN智能体的感知、推理和规划问题，显著提升了导航性能

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from perception errors, reasoning errors, and planning errors, which significantly hinder their navigation performance. To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.

Motivation: 当前最好的生成模型（如扩散模型和基于流的模型）需要数百到数千次神经函数评估来计算单个似然值，这构成了计算瓶颈。虽然现有蒸馏方法可以加速采样，但要么完全放弃似然计算，要么仍需要昂贵的全轨迹积分。

Method: 提出快速流联合蒸馏（F2D2）框架，利用连续归一化流中采样和似然的耦合ODE共享底层速度场的特点，通过单个模型联合蒸馏采样轨迹和累积散度，仅需添加一个散度预测头。

Result: F2D2能够在少量步骤评估下实现准确的对数似然计算，同时保持高样本质量。应用该方法的2步MeanFlow模型仅需额外一次反向NFE就能超越1024步教师模型。

Conclusion: F2D2解决了基于流生成模型中长期存在的计算瓶颈，实现了采样和似然评估的高效联合加速，为生成模型的实际应用提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AW-LSSVM是一种自适应加权最小二乘支持向量机，通过迭代全局耦合促进多视图互补学习，每个视图专注于其他视图在前次迭代中的困难样本，在保持原始特征隔离的同时优于现有核方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核基多视图学习方法通常使用融合技术而不强制视图间的显式协作类型，或采用协同正则化限制了全局协作。需要一种能促进互补学习、让不同视图相互协作的方法。

Method: 提出自适应加权LS-SVM（AW-LSSVM），通过迭代全局耦合机制，使每个视图专注于其他视图在前次迭代中的困难样本，促进互补学习。该方法保持原始特征隔离，适合隐私保护场景。

Result: 实验表明AW-LSSVM在大多数数据集上优于现有的核基多视图学习方法，同时保持原始特征隔离，使其也适用于隐私保护场景。

Conclusion: AW-LSSVM通过迭代全局耦合有效促进多视图互补学习，在性能上优于现有方法，且特征隔离特性使其适用于隐私敏感应用。

Abstract: Multi-view learning integrates diverse representations of the same instances to improve performance. Most existing kernel-based multi-view learning methods use fusion techniques without enforcing an explicit collaboration type across views or co-regularization which limits global collaboration. We propose AW-LSSVM, an adaptive weighted LS-SVM that promotes complementary learning by an iterative global coupling to make each view focus on hard samples of others from previous iterations. Experiments demonstrate that AW-LSSVM outperforms existing kernel-based multi-view methods on most datasets, while keeping raw features isolated, making it also suitable for privacy-preserving scenarios.

TL;DR: OptPO提出了一种自适应分配推理预算的测试时策略优化框架，通过贝叶斯序贯概率比检验动态停止采样，显著减少计算冗余同时保持或提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时策略优化方法依赖固定预算的多数投票来估计奖励，导致大量计算冗余，需要更高效的预算分配机制。

Method: 将投票过程建模为贝叶斯序贯概率比检验，动态停止采样；保留的rollout用于策略更新，可与PPO或GRPO等算法无缝集成，无需真实标签。

Result: 在多样化推理基准测试中，相比固定样本基线，OptPO显著减少了rollout开销，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: OptPO通过将统计最优停止与测试时学习统一起来，为测试时适应提供了一个计算高效的范式。

Abstract: Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出基于生成蒸馏的持续遗忘框架，解决视觉生成模型在序列删除请求下的遗忘问题，避免稳定性危机和性能退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉生成模型训练数据与隐私法规（如GDPR的"被遗忘权"）存在冲突，需要机器遗忘技术。现有方法无法处理现实世界中序列到达的删除请求（持续遗忘），简单应用一次性方法会导致稳定性危机、保留概念崩溃和生成质量下降。

Method: 提出基于生成蒸馏的持续遗忘框架，将每个遗忘步骤重构为多目标师生蒸馏过程，利用持续学习原理保持模型完整性。通过教师-学生蒸馏机制实现有针对性的稳定遗忘。

Result: 在10步序列基准测试中，该方法能更好地遗忘目标概念，同时对保留概念性能和整体图像质量没有显著干扰，大幅优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模生成模型的负责任部署和维护提供了可行路径，使行业能够以实用有效的方式满足持续的数据删除请求。

Abstract: The recent rapid growth of visual generative models trained on vast web-scale datasets has created significant tension with data privacy regulations and copyright laws, such as GDPR's ``Right to be Forgotten.'' This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GVT是一个两阶段分子生成框架，通过图向量量化VAE将分子图压缩为离散潜在序列，再用自回归Transformer生成，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型计算量大，自回归模型存在错误传播问题，需要一种既高效又准确的分子生成方法。

Method: 提出Graph VQ-Transformer：1) 图向量量化VAE将分子图压缩为高保真离散潜在序列；2) 结合图Transformer、RCM节点排序和RoPE位置编码；3) 在离散潜在序列上训练自回归Transformer。

Result: 在ZINC250k、MOSES、GuacaMol等基准测试中达到SOTA或极具竞争力的性能，在FCD和KL散度等关键分布相似性指标上优于主流扩散模型。

Conclusion: GVT提供了比扩散模型更优的替代方案，为离散潜在空间分子生成建立了新基准，并为与大型语言模型的潜在协同开辟了道路。

Abstract: The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.

Motivation: 共形预测能为黑盒机器学习模型提供统计上严谨的不确定性集合，但需要进一步提高其效率。共形校正通过共形感知的低效损失来微调或包装基础模型，但存在效率与预测熵之间的权衡问题

Method: 提出熵约束的共形校正方法，在给定熵阈值的情况下，探索效率与熵之间更好的帕累托最优解

Result: 在计算机视觉和图数据集上的大量实验结果表明，该方法能显著提高最先进共形预测方法的效率，在给定熵阈值的情况下，效率提升可达34.4%

Conclusion: 通过熵约束的共形校正方法，可以在保持预测熵可控的同时，显著提高共形预测的效率，实现了效率与不确定性之间的更好平衡

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides a comprehensive framework to produce statistically rigorous uncertainty sets for black-box machine learning models. To further improve the efficiency of CP, conformal correction is proposed to fine-tune or wrap the base model with an extra module using a conformal-aware inefficiency loss. In this work, we empirically and theoretically identify a trade-off between the CP efficiency and the entropy of model prediction. We then propose an entropy-constrained conformal correction method, exploring a better Pareto optimum between efficiency and entropy. Extensive experimental results on both computer vision and graph datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. For instance, it can significantly improve the efficiency of state-of-the-art CP methods by up to 34.4%, given an entropy threshold.

Conclusion: FGC-Comp是一个轻量级、分类器无关且易于部署的属性补全模块，能显著提升在不完整属性下的邻居聚合稳定性和预测可靠性

Abstract: Graph-based Anomaly Detection models have gained widespread adoption in recent years, identifying suspicious nodes by aggregating neighborhood information. However, most existing studies overlook the pervasive issues of missing and adversarially obscured node attributes, which can undermine aggregation stability and prediction reliability. To mitigate this, we propose FGC-Comp, a lightweight, classifier-agnostic, and deployment-friendly attribute completion module-designed to enhance neighborhood aggregation under incomplete attributes. We partition each node's neighbors into three label-based groups, apply group-specific transforms to the labeled groups while a node-conditioned gate handles unknowns, fuse messages via residual connections, and train end-to-end with a binary classification objective to improve aggregation stability and prediction reliability under missing attributes. Experiments on two real-world fraud datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential for deploying reliable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where existing approaches primarily rely on Bayesian inference or ensembles. In this paper, we introduce the first credal graph neural networks (CGNNs), which extend credal learning to the graph domain by training GNNs to output set-valued predictions in the form of credal sets. To account for the distinctive nature of message passing in GNNs, we develop a complementary approach to credal learning that leverages different aspects of layer-wise information propagation. We assess our approach on uncertainty quantification in node classification under out-of-distribution conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the graph homophily assumption in shaping the effectiveness of uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGNNs deliver more reliable representations of epistemic uncertainty and achieve state-of-the-art performance under distributional shift on heterophilic graphs.

Motivation: 现有方法如变分自编码器需要复杂的分布匹配技术，本文受无线通信中对抗性干扰理论的启发，探索一种新的潜在空间分布匹配方法。

Method: 将对抗性无线干扰建模为最小化均方误差失真的minimax博弈，其中干扰器试图破坏高斯源在对抗信道中的恢复。利用该博弈的鞍点特性（产生对角高斯噪声）作为潜在空间分布匹配的辅助目标。

Conclusion: 对抗性干扰为潜在空间分布匹配提供了新颖有效的正则化方法，将通信理论中的对抗性概念成功应用于深度学习中的分布匹配问题。

Abstract: We propose the use of adversarial wireless jamming to regularise the latent space of an autoencoder to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific data point was included in the training set of a target model. Although there are have been numerous methods developed for detecting data contamination in large language models (LLMs), their performance on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) falls short due to the instabilities introduced through multimodal component adaptation and possible distribution shifts across multiple inputs. In this work, we investigate multimodal membership inference and address two issues: first, by identifying distribution shifts in the existing datasets, and second, by releasing an extended baseline pipeline to detect them. We also generalize the perturbation-based membership inference methods to MLLMs and release \textbf{FiMMIA} -- a modular \textbf{F}ramework for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{MIA}.\footnote{The source code and framework have been made publicly available under the MIT license via \href{https://github.com/ai-forever/data_leakage_detect}{link}.The video demonstration is available on \href{https://youtu.be/a9L4-H80aSg}{YouTube}.} Our approach trains a neural network to analyze the target model's behavior on perturbed inputs, capturing distributional differences between members and non-members. Comprehensive evaluations on various fine-tuned multimodal models demonstrate the effectiveness of our perturbation-based membership inference attacks in multimodal domains.

Motivation: 流基扩散模型已成为图像和视频生成的主流方法，但其记忆-泛化行为仍缺乏深入理解。研究者希望重新审视流匹配目标，分析其边缘速度场，以揭示模型训练动态的本质。

Method: 通过分析流匹配目标的边缘速度场，该速度场具有闭式表达式，允许精确计算oracle流匹配目标。分析揭示了模型固有的两阶段训练目标结构。

Result: 研究发现流基扩散模型形成两阶段训练：早期阶段由数据模式混合引导进行泛化，后期阶段由最近数据样本主导进行记忆。这解释了模型训练动态，并为实际技术（如时间步偏移调度、分类器自由引导区间、潜在空间设计）提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对扩散模型训练动态的理解，为未来架构和算法改进提供了指导原则，揭示了流匹配模型在泛化和记忆之间的平衡机制。

Abstract: Flow-based diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for training generative models across images and videos. However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices. Our study deepens the understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offers principles for guiding future architectural and algorithmic improvements.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的输入归一化方法，发现REVIN是最有效的归一化方法，能显著提升零样本性能，同时保持最佳域内精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据与文本或图像不同，存在显著的尺度变化和非平稳性，这些特性可能损害TSFM的性能。虽然归一化在数据集特定的时间序列模型中已有研究，但在需要泛化的TSFMs中却被忽视。

Method: 通过系统评估四种架构不同的TSFMs，比较了不同归一化方法的效果，重点关注REVIN方法与其他归一化方法的对比。

Result: REVIN是最有效的归一化方法：相对于未归一化基线，零样本MASE降低了89%；相对于其他归一化方法，降低了44%；同时匹配最佳域内精度（0.84 MASE），无需任何数据集级预处理，实现了最高的精度-效率权衡。

Conclusion: REVIN是TSFMs中最有效的归一化方法，但其效果利用取决于架构设计选择和优化目标，特别是训练损失尺度敏感性和模型类型（概率、点预测或基于LLM的模型）。

Abstract: We investigate input normalization methods for Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).

Motivation: 文本丰富的动态双边市场（如劳动力市场）中，内容不断演变，交互图动态变化，传统的独立模型难以有效处理这种复杂性，需要结合文本语义和图结构的新方法。

Abstract: Recommending matches in a text-rich, dynamic two-sided marketplace presents unique challenges due to evolving content and interaction graphs. We introduce GraphMatch, a new large-scale recommendation framework that fuses pre-trained language models with graph neural networks to overcome these challenges. Unlike prior approaches centered on standalone models, GraphMatch is a comprehensive recipe built on powerful text encoders and GNNs working in tandem. It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. These results demonstrate that unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution to text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs in practice.

TL;DR: 提出自适应去中心化联邦学习(aDFL)方法，通过自适应调整客户端学习率来缓解异常客户端对全局模型的负面影响，无需先验知识或严格邻域条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习(DFL)中异常客户端（由噪声或中毒数据引起）会显著破坏学习过程并降低模型鲁棒性。现有方法通常需要足够多的正常邻域客户端或可靠客户端的先验知识，这降低了DFL的实际适用性。

Method: 提出自适应DFL(aDFL)方法，核心思想是自适应调整客户端的学习率：对可疑客户端分配较小学习率，对正常客户端分配较大学习率，以完全自适应方式减轻异常客户端对全局模型的负面影响。

Result: 理论分析不要求严格的邻域节点条件且无需先验知识，提供了严格的收敛分析以保证aDFL的oracle性质。大量数值实验证明了aDFL方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: aDFL方法通过自适应学习率调整有效缓解了异常客户端的影响，提高了去中心化联邦学习的鲁棒性和实用性，无需依赖先验知识或严格的邻域条件。

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (DFL), the presence of abnormal clients, often caused by noisy or poisoned data, can significantly disrupt the learning process and degrade the overall robustness of the model. Previous methods on this issue often require a sufficiently large number of normal neighboring clients or prior knowledge of reliable clients, which reduces the practical applicability of DFL. To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients. By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the aDFL method.

Abstract: Outer loop tasks such as optimization, uncertainty quantification or inference can easily become intractable when the underlying high-fidelity model is computationally expensive. Similarly, data-driven architectures typically require large datasets to perform predictive tasks with sufficient accuracy. A possible approach to mitigate these challenges is the development of multi-fidelity emulators, leveraging potentially biased, inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting and refining predictions using scarce, accurate high-fidelity data. This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources. In doing so, we consider a large number of architectural, hyperparameter, and dataset configurations including networks with a different amount of spectral bias (Multi-Layered Perceptron, Siren and Kolmogorov Arnold Network), various mechanisms for coordinate encoding, exact or learnable low-fidelity information, and for varying training dataset size. We further analyze the added value of the multi-fidelity approach by conducting equivalent single-fidelity tests for each case, quantifying the performance gains achieved through fusing multiple sources of information.

TL;DR: Fairy2i是一个将预训练实值LLM转换为等效复值形式的通用框架，通过广泛线性映射实现无损转换，结合相位感知量化和递归残差量化机制，在2位精度下恢复LLaMA-2 7B性能，显著优于现有实值量化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然复值LLM（如iFairy）在低比特表示方面优于实值模型，但它们需要从头训练，无法利用现有预训练实值基础模型生态系统。需要一种方法既能利用复值算术的表征效率，又能重用现有预训练模型。

Method: 1) 证明实值与广泛线性映射之间的无损数学等价性，将标准Transformer转换到复域；2) 采用相位感知量化方案，使用四阶单位根的高效码本；3) 引入递归残差量化机制，迭代最小化量化误差，实现无需乘法的高效推理。

Result: Fairy2i在有效2位精度下恢复了LLaMA-2 7B的性能，达到接近全精度基线的水平，显著优于最先进的实值二值和三值量化方法。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了复值算术的表征效率与预训练模型实际效用之间的差距，为在商用硬件上进行高效推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their massive memory and computational demands necessitate aggressive quantization, increasingly pushing representations toward the theoretical limit of a single bit. While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前预测交通事故的研究主要依赖道路网络结构特征，忽略了道路表面及其周围环境的物理和环境信息。本研究旨在通过整合卫星图像等多模态数据来改进交通事故预测。

Method: 构建了一个覆盖美国六个州的大型多模态数据集，包含900万条交通事故记录和100万张高分辨率卫星图像。每个道路网络节点都标注了天气统计、道路类型等特征，边标注了交通流量信息。使用多模态学习方法整合视觉和网络嵌入进行预测。

Result: 整合多模态数据将预测准确率提高到平均AUROC 90.1%，比仅使用图结构的图神经网络模型提高了3.7%。因果分析发现：降水增加使事故率上升24%，高速公路等高速度道路使事故率上升22%，季节模式使事故率上升29%。

Conclusion: 卫星图像特征对于实现准确的交通事故预测至关重要。整合多模态数据能显著提高预测性能，并有助于识别影响交通事故的关键因素。

Abstract: We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PruningAMR算法通过剪枝隐式神经表示(INR)的权重矩阵来识别几何特征，并以此指导自适应网格细化，实现自动化的可变分辨率可视化，显著节省内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然INR比传统格点数据更节省内存，但许多可视化任务仍需要将数据离散化到规则网格上。现有方法缺乏根据INR内部几何特征自动生成自适应网格的能力。

Method: 使用插值分解剪枝方法处理INR的权重矩阵来识别几何特征，基于剪枝后的网络指导自适应网格细化，从预训练的INR（无需访问其训练数据）生成可变分辨率网格。

Result: 能够从预训练的INR自动生成适应底层函数分辨率的可变分辨率可视化，实现显著的内存节省。

Conclusion: PruningAMR算法有效解决了INR可视化中的内存效率问题，通过剪枝权重矩阵识别几何特征并指导自适应网格生成，为4D CT扫描等内存密集型可视化任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: An implicit neural representation (INR) is a neural network that approximates a spatiotemporal function. Many memory-intensive visualization tasks, including modern 4D CT scanning methods, represent data natively as INRs. While INRs are prized for being more memory-efficient than traditional data stored on a lattice, many visualization tasks still require discretization to a regular grid. We present PruningAMR, an algorithm that builds a mesh with resolution adapted to geometric features encoded by the INR. To identify these geometric features, we use an interpolative decomposition pruning method on the weight matrices of the INR. The resulting pruned network is used to guide adaptive mesh refinement, enabling automatic mesh generation tailored to the underlying resolution of the function. Starting from a pre-trained INR--without access to its training data--we produce a variable resolution visualization with substantial memory savings.

Abstract: Understanding the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical to advance precision oncology. We present ProteinPNet, a novel framework based on prototypical part networks that discovers TME motifs from spatial proteomics data. Unlike traditional post-hoc explanability models, ProteinPNet directly learns discriminative, interpretable, faithful spatial prototypes through supervised training. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets with ground truth motifs, and further test it on a real-world lung cancer spatial proteomics dataset. ProteinPNet consistently identifies biologically meaningful prototypes aligned with different tumor subtypes. Through graphical and morphological analyses, we show that these prototypes capture interpretable features pointing to differences in immune infiltration and tissue modularity. Our results highlight the potential of prototype-based learning to reveal interpretable spatial biomarkers within the TME, with implications for mechanistic discovery in spatial omics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分布校准的聚合方法，用于提升LLM作为评估者在成对偏好判断中的可靠性，通过建模三向偏好并利用评分分布的极性和决定性信息来减少噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM作为评估者在单样本层面存在噪声，常见的聚合方法（多数投票、软自一致性或基于指令的自聚合）在允许平局时存在不一致性问题，需要更可靠的聚合方案。

Method: 提出基于分布校准的聚合方案：为每个项目生成n个独立的思考-评分样本，使用Bradley-Terry-Davidson模型对评分计数进行三向偏好建模，同时利用极性（非平局间的差异）和决定性（非平局率）来区分窄边际与强共识。

Result: 在各种评估基准测试中，该方法相比标准基线持续减少MAE并提高成对准确率；在与人类共识元标签对比时，匹配或超过个体人类评分者的表现。

Conclusion: 通过精心分配推理时计算资源并采用分布感知的聚合方法，可以将嘈杂的个体模型判断转化为可靠的评估评分，提升LLM作为评估者的可靠性。

Abstract: Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) used as judges for pairwise preferences remain noisy at the single-sample level, and common aggregation rules (majority vote, soft self-consistency, or instruction-based self-aggregation) are inconsistent when ties are allowed. We study inference-time compute (ITC) for evaluators that generate n independent thinking-rating samples per item, and propose a principled, distribution-calibrated aggregation scheme. Our method models three-way preferences with a Bradley-Terry-Davidson formulation on rating counts, leveraging both polarity (margin among non-ties) and decisiveness (non-tie rate) to distinguish narrow margins from strong consensus. Across various evaluation benchmarks, our approach consistently reduces MAE and increases pairwise accuracy versus standard baselines, and when evaluated against human-consensus meta-labels, matches or exceeds individual human raters. These results show that carefully allocating ITC and aggregating with distribution-aware methods turns noisy individual model judgments into reliable ratings for evaluation.
