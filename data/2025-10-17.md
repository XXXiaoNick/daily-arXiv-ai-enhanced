### [1] [Bridging the Semantic Gap: Contrastive Rewards for Multilingual Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13827)
*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合组相对策略优化(GRPO)和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，用于提升跨语言Text-to-SQL系统的任务效率和语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法只关注可执行查询，忽视了语义对齐挑战，包括查询语义含义和执行结果的正确性。从英语到其他语言时，执行准确率平均下降6个百分点。

Method: 使用GRPO框架结合多语言对比奖励信号，通过基于语义相似度的奖励信号来改善SQL生成与用户意图的对应关系。

Result: 在七语言MultiSpider数据集上，使用GRPO微调LLaMA-3-3B模型，执行准确率提升至87.4%(比零样本+26pp)，语义准确率提升至52.29%(+32.86pp)。添加对比奖励信号后，平均语义准确率进一步提升至59.14%(+6.85pp)。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过对比奖励实现定向语义对齐，可以在不需要大规模训练数据集的情况下显著提升Text-to-SQL系统性能，较小的3B模型在微调后甚至能超越更大的8B零样本模型。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

### [2] [From Explainability to Action: A Generative Operational Framework for Integrating XAI in Clinical Mental Health Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13828)
*Ratna Kandala,Akshata Kishore Moharir,Divya Arvinda Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出生成式操作框架，利用LLM作为翻译引擎，将XAI技术输出转化为临床可用的叙述性报告，解决心理健康筛查中技术透明度与临床实用性之间的鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI技术（如SHAP、LIME）虽然能产生技术准确的输出，但无法提供临床相关、可操作的见解，导致实验室到临床应用的持续差距。

Method: 提出生成式操作框架，使用LLM作为核心翻译引擎，结合RAG检索临床指南，将原始XAI技术输出自动生成为人类可读、基于证据的临床叙述。

Result: 该框架直接解决了工作流整合、偏见缓解和利益相关者特定沟通等关键操作障碍。

Conclusion: 为领域提供了从生成孤立数据点向交付集成、可操作且可信赖的临床AI的战略路线图。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

### [3] [A Linguistics-Aware LLM Watermarking via Syntactic Predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13829)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STELA是一种公开可验证的水印框架，通过基于词性n-gram的语言自由度动态调节水印强度，在保持文本质量的同时提高检测鲁棒性，无需访问模型logits。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法依赖模型特定信号（如token级熵），需要访问模型logits，这阻碍了公开验证。需要一种不依赖模型内部信息的水印方法。

Method: 使用词性n-gram建模语言不确定性，在语法约束强的语境中减弱水印信号以保持质量，在语言灵活性高的语境中增强信号以提高可检测性。

Result: 在分析性英语、孤立性汉语和黏着性韩语上的实验表明，STELA在检测鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STELA通过语言自由度对齐水印强度，实现了公开可验证的水印检测，在多种语言类型中表现优异。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/stela_watermark.

### [4] [Users as Annotators: LLM Preference Learning from Comparison Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13830)
*Zhongze Cai,Xiaocheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从用户比较模式中收集成对偏好数据的新方法，通过两个不同模型生成响应，利用不对称性推断用户数据质量，并开发EM算法估计用户潜在质量因子来过滤标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型广泛应用，用户在日常交互中贡献了越来越多的偏好标注，但缺乏质量控制。用户是判断自己查询响应质量的最佳专家，但标注质量参差不齐。

Method: 提出从两个不同模型生成响应，利用不对称性推断用户数据质量；开发期望最大化算法估计用户潜在质量因子，并据此过滤用户标注数据。

Result: 下游任务验证了该方法在捕捉用户行为和为大语言模型对齐进行数据过滤方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 用户比较模式收集的成对偏好数据是可行的，通过提出的用户行为模型和质量估计算法可以有效控制数据质量，为大语言模型对齐提供高质量数据源。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

### [5] [Informed Routing in LLMs: Smarter Token-Level Computation for Faster Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13831)
*Chao Han,Yijuan Liang,Zihao Xuan,Daokuan Wu,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

### [6] [Investigating Political and Demographic Associations in Large Language Models Through Moral Foundations Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13902)
*Nicole Smith-Vaniz,Harper Lyon,Lorraine Steigner,Ben Armstrong,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了大型语言模型在道德和政治领域的潜在偏见，使用道德基础理论框架直接比较LLM响应与人类研究数据，评估LLM是否表现出意识形态倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在日常生活中扮演越来越重要的建议者角色，需要了解它们在困难政治和道德领域中的响应是否存在偏见，特别是与人类道德推理的差异。

Method: 使用道德基础理论框架，分析LLM在固有响应、直接政治意识形态表达以及基于人口统计的角色扮演场景中的响应，并与现有的人类研究数据直接比较。

Result: 研究发现LLM响应确实表现出意识形态倾向，无论是在固有响应中，还是在明确提示或基于人口统计的角色扮演中，都存在政治和人口统计依赖性。

Conclusion: LLM在道德和政治领域的响应存在明显的意识形态倾向，这为理解AI生成内容的政治和人口统计依赖性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

### [7] [Entropy Meets Importance: A Unified Head Importance-Entropy Score for Stable and Efficient Transformer Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13832)
*Minsik Choi,Hyegang Son,Changhoon Kim,Young Geun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HIES剪枝标准，结合头部重要性分数和注意力熵，相比仅使用HIS的方法在模型质量和稳定性上分别提升15.2%和2.04倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型虽然性能优异，但多层多头结构导致推理效率问题。现有基于HIS的剪枝方法仅考虑梯度驱动的贡献，忽视了注意力模式的多样性

Method: 提出HIES剪枝标准，将头部重要性分数与注意力熵相结合，提供关于每个头部贡献的互补证据

Result: 基于HIES的剪枝方法在模型质量上提升15.2%，稳定性提升2.04倍，实现了显著的模型压缩而不牺牲准确率或稳定性

Conclusion: HIES剪枝方法有效克服了HIS方法的局限性，通过整合注意力熵信息，在保持模型性能的同时实现了高效的模型压缩

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

### [8] [Readers Prefer Outputs of AI Trained on Copyrighted Books over Expert Human Writers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13939)
*Tuhin Chakrabarty,Jane C. Ginsburg,Paramveer Dhillon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过微调AI模型在作者完整作品上，AI生成的文本在风格保真度和写作质量上超越了专业人类作家，且成本大幅降低，这对版权法中的合理使用条款具有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证AI模型是否能生成高质量文学作品并模仿作者风格，以回应关于AI使用受版权保护训练材料的法律争议。

Method: 进行预注册研究，比较MFA专业作家与ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini三种前沿AI模型，通过盲测配对评估，使用上下文提示和微调两种方法生成450字以内的文本片段。

Result: 上下文提示生成的AI文本被专家强烈否定，但微调后完全逆转：专家现在偏好AI文本，风格保真度OR=8.16，写作质量OR=1.87，且AI检测率仅3%。

Conclusion: 作者特定的微调使AI能生成读者偏好的非逐字写作，为版权法中"对潜在市场影响"的合理使用因素提供了实证证据。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

TL;DR: ConDABench是一个用于生成对话式数据分析基准测试的框架，包含多智能体工作流生成的1,420个问题，以及首个能够系统评估对话式数据分析工具的评价体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据分析任务通常目标不明确且数据不干净，需要用户交互来理解和澄清意图，但现有基准测试无法捕捉这些复杂性或提供交互支持。

Method: 使用多智能体工作流从公开数据集的分析文章中生成真实基准测试，创建1,420个对话式数据分析问题，并开发系统评估工具。

Result: 评估显示最新LLM能解决更多实例，但在需要持续、长形式交互的任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型构建者提供了衡量真正协作模型进展的途径，这些模型能够完成复杂的交互任务。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Motivation: 为美国6800万非英语家庭人口提供准确及时的天气信息，建设天气就绪国家，改善多语言风险沟通

Method: 与LILT合作，利用专利训练过程使大语言模型适应天气术语的神经机器翻译，结合GIS地图识别语言需求，集成伦理AI实践

Result: 开发了支持西班牙语、简体中文、越南语等的可扩展翻译系统，显著减少人工翻译时间，减轻操作负担

Conclusion: 该项目建立了实验性多语言气象产品网站，使国家预警系统向服务所有美国人迈进一步

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

Conclusion: 基于相似性的黑盒UQ方法能够有效量化LLM的不确定性，为构建可信AI系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽略了现实世界的复杂性：训练标签存在偏见，不同文化背景的个体对仇恨言论的定义存在差异。

Method: 构建文化感知框架，通过建模文化属性组合来缓解数据稀疏性，使用标签传播捕捉每个组合的独特特征，最终构建个体仇恨子空间。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有指标上平均优于最先进方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 提出的文化感知框架能有效解决仇恨言论检测中的数据稀疏、文化纠缠和标签模糊问题，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建本体耗时耗力，而数字时代中大量非结构化文本需要有效组织方式。特别是在电子商务领域，海量产品列表需要适当的产品分类和组织。

Method: 利用大语言模型的最新进展，开发了从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体（以部分-整体关系形式）的全自动方法。

Result: 通过LLM作为评判者进行评估，证明该方法提取的本体优于现有的基于BERT的基线方法。

Conclusion: 本研究为在大语言模型更广泛地应用于产品或其他领域本体提取奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

Method: 提出ADMIT攻击方法，这是一种少样本、语义对齐的投毒技术，无需访问目标LLM、检索器或令牌级控制，通过多注入技术实现攻击

Result: 在4个检索器、11个LLM和4个跨领域基准测试中，ADMIT在极低投毒率(0.93×10^-6)下平均攻击成功率达86%，比现有最佳攻击方法提升11.2%

Conclusion: ADMIT暴露了现实世界基于RAG的事实核查系统的显著脆弱性，即使在存在强有力反证据的情况下仍保持鲁棒性

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO)，一种无需标签的样本高效提示优化框架，通过双人赌博机设置和LLM评判的成对偏好反馈来优化提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法大多需要真实标签数据，但在实践中收集高质量标签成本高且缓慢，需要开发无需标签的优化方法。

Method: 将问题建模为双人赌博机设置，结合Double Thompson Sampling（优先选择信息丰富的提示比较）和Top-Performer Guided Mutation（通过变异高性能提示扩展候选池）。

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard和MS MARCO上的实验表明，PDO持续优于基线方法，消融研究验证了D-TS和提示变异策略的有效性。

Conclusion: PDO提供了一种无需标签的提示优化解决方案，能够有效利用LLM评判的成对偏好反馈，在标签稀缺场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT是一个针对医疗领域的预训练基础模型，通过将电子健康记录序列化来更好地捕捉临床事件间的时序关系，在抗生素敏感性预测任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以协调电子健康记录的表格化、事件化特性与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的结构不匹配，限制了捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 基于SciBERT进行额外预训练，专门设计用于编码临床事件间的时间和上下文关系，生成更丰富的患者表征。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务上，SerialBEHRT相比现有最先进的EHR表征策略实现了更优越和更一致的性能。

Conclusion: 时序序列化在医疗基础模型预训练中具有重要意义，SerialBEHRT证明了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynaSpec提出了一种上下文相关的动态词汇表短列表机制，通过轻量级元分类器将上下文路由到少量token簇，解决了传统固定词汇表短列表在推测解码中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码中，固定词汇表短列表方法存在两个主要问题：(i) 频率列表依赖于语料库且需要重新调优，(ii) 静态短列表抑制了罕见或领域特定token，降低了每次验证步骤的预期token数量。

Method: 引入轻量级粗粒度元分类器，将上下文路由到少量token簇；选择的前k个簇的并集形成起草器的短列表，同时验证保留完整词汇表和精确性。通过并行执行起草编码和元短列表计算来提高效率。

Result: 在标准推测解码基准测试中，相比固定短列表基线，在平均接受长度方面获得了一致的增益，同时上下文相关选择使得能够使用更小的短列表而不降低接受率。

Conclusion: DynaSpec提供了一种鲁棒、加速起草并能泛化到多样化任务的动态短列表机制，解决了传统固定词汇表方法的局限性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准方法在处理复杂组合任务（如从长对话生成翻译总结）时表现不佳，需要更有效的多任务执行方案。

Method: 在组合的总结和翻译适配器顶部添加可学习投影层，实现任务有效集成，减少计算开销。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在云端和移动设备上性能良好且速度快，开发了可执行组合任务的Android应用。

Conclusion: 该框架在需要高速操作和资源受限的实际应用中具有潜在优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级推理时方法，通过PCA识别语言方向并引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，有效减少多语言LLM中的意外代码切换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型经常出现意外的代码切换，降低了在下游任务中的可靠性。

Method: 潜在空间语言引导方法：在平行翻译数据上使用PCA识别语言方向，然后沿着这些轴引导token嵌入来控制语言身份。

Result: 使用单个主成分实现95-99%的语言分类准确率，在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上跨多个语言对将下一个token分布差异减少高达42%。

Conclusion: 语言身份在最终层集中，具有近乎完美的线性可分性，该方法能有效缓解代码切换同时保持语义，仅需最小计算开销和少量平行数据进行校准。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理语言学中的均匀信息密度假说启发，旨在分析LLM推理过程中的信息流模式。

Method: 引入基于熵的指标来分析推理轨迹中的信息流，在三个数学基准测试上进行实验。

Result: 发现正确的解决方案以信息密度的不均匀波动为特征，与人类沟通模式形成鲜明对比。

Conclusion: 这一结果挑战了关于机器推理的假设，并为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

TL;DR: EvoEdit是一种通过顺序零空间对齐来缓解灾难性干扰的模型编辑方法，能够在长编辑序列中保持原始和修改知识的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位-编辑框架的方法在顺序编辑场景中存在灾难性干扰问题，新编辑会损害先前集成的更新和保留知识。

Method: 采用顺序零空间对齐策略，为每个传入编辑执行零空间对齐，保留原始和先前修改的知识表示。

Result: 在真实世界顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit达到或优于现有最先进技术，速度提升高达3.53倍。

Conclusion: EvoEdit为动态演化信息环境中的LLM设计提供了简单有效且具有强理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConsistencyAI是一个独立基准测试工具，用于衡量大型语言模型在不同用户身份下的回答事实一致性，发现不同模型的事实一致性存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM是否会对不同身份的用户提供事实不一致的回答，确保模型回答的客观性和公平性。

Method: 使用100个不同身份的用户提示，向19个LLM询问15个主题的5个事实，通过句子嵌入和跨身份余弦相似度计算事实一致性得分。

Result: Grok-3一致性最高，轻量级模型一致性最低；不同主题一致性差异明显，就业市场最不一致，G7领导人最一致。

Conclusion: LLM的事实一致性受提供商和主题影响，需要开发身份无关的提示策略来确保回答一致性。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

TL;DR: BenchPress是一个人类在环系统，通过RAG和LLMs为SQL查询生成自然语言描述，加速领域特定text-to-SQL基准的创建，减少人工标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有text-to-SQL研究主要关注公开数据集，但在私有企业数据仓库中效果不佳。手动标注SQL日志成本高昂，需要专家参与。

Method: 给定SQL查询，使用检索增强生成和LLMs提出多个自然语言描述，由人类专家选择、排序或编辑以确保准确性和领域对齐。

Result: 在标注的企业SQL日志上评估显示，LLM辅助标注大幅减少了创建高质量基准的时间和精力，提高了标注准确性和基准可靠性。

Conclusion: BenchPress通过结合人类验证和LLM生成建议，为研究人员和从业者提供了评估领域特定text-to-SQL模型的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at

TL;DR: R2T框架将语言规则融入神经网络训练目标，通过自适应损失函数处理OOV词汇，在无标注文本上训练即可达到98.2%的词性标注准确率，优于基于300标注句子的AfriBERTa模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出原则性学习范式，让模型通过显式任务约束而非仅依赖标注数据进行训练，特别针对低资源语言处理问题。

Method: 开发Rule-to-Tag框架，将多层级语言规则整合到神经网络训练目标中，使用包含正则化项的自适应损失函数来处理OOV词汇的不确定性。

Result: 在Zarma语言的词性标注任务中，仅使用无标注文本训练的R2T-BiLSTM模型达到98.2%准确率；在命名实体识别任务中，R2T预训练模型仅需50个标注句子即可超越基于300标注句子的基线模型。

Conclusion: R2T框架在低资源场景下表现出色，证明了原则性学习范式的有效性，能够显著减少对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同LLM具有互补能力，但集成方法对错误信号（如异构分词方案和模型能力差异）的鲁棒性关注不足，集成失败通常源于token级和模型级的不一致性。

Method: 提出CoRE技术：token级一致性使用低通滤波器降低高不一致性token的权重；模型级一致性通过促进高自信度且与其他模型差异小的输出来增强全局一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试、模型组合和集成策略上的广泛实验表明，CoRE能持续提升集成性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoRE通过处理token级和模型级的不一致性，有效提升了LLM集成的鲁棒性，且能与多种集成方法无缝集成。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

Conclusion: 轻量级RAG与通用LLM结合，通过简单索引和融合添加相关示例，为多模态临床NLP任务提供了简单有效的基线方法。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: transformer架构虽然性能优异，但存在显著的内存和计算开销，研究发现这些模型存在架构冗余，为优化提供了机会。

Method: 基于AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝的研究，提出ShishuLM架构，在中等上下文场景下，通过MLP近似整个transformer块，减少参数和KV缓存需求。

Result: 相比父模型，ShishuLM在训练和推理时内存需求减少25%，延迟改善40%。

Conclusion: 该研究为从预训练角度构建更高效的小型语言模型架构提供了见解。

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

Method: 使用三种前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）对16,986个对话回合进行零样本情感标注，包括效价、唤醒度和学习帮助性的标量评分以及自由文本情感标签，通过排名加权模型内池化和跨模型多数共识融合这些估计。

Result: 学生通常报告轻度积极情感和中等唤醒度；困惑和好奇是问题解决中的常见伴随状态；挫败感虽较少见但会阻碍进展；情感状态短暂，积极时刻稍长但易受干扰；负面情感常快速解决，有时直接反弹为积极状态；中性时刻常作为转折点，更多引导向上而非向下。

Conclusion: 中性时刻为导师干预提供了关键机会点，情感动态的深入理解有助于负责任地将生成式AI整合到教育中，关注学习者的情感演变状态。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

TL;DR: 提出了模板填充（TI）方法，为扩散语言模型设计专门的生成策略，通过动态段分配（DSA）自适应调整段长度，在数学推理和代码生成任务上实现17.01%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型缺乏专门设计的推理策略，目前仍沿用自回归模型的前缀提示方法，需要为DLMs开发更合适的条件生成方法。

Method: 模板填充（TI）：先生成目标响应的结构模板，然后填充掩码段；动态段分配（DSA）：根据生成置信度自适应调整段长度。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，相比基线方法实现了17.01%的稳定性能提升，并在多token生成设置中保持生成质量的同时实现有效加速。

Conclusion: 模板填充方法为扩散语言模型提供了有效的结构控制生成策略，显著提升了推理性能并支持高效的多token生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

*Filipe Laitenberger,Dawid Kopiczko,Cees G. M. Snoek,Yuki M. Asano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GateSkip是一种简单的残差流门控机制，通过在解码器模型中添加sigmoid线性门来实现token级别的层跳过，在推理时根据门值对token排序并跳过低重要性token，可节省15%计算量同时保持90%以上准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的早期退出或基于路由器的混合深度模型存在不稳定且需要大量重新训练的问题，需要一种能够在预训练模型上稳定微调的层跳过方法。

Method: 在每个Attention/MLP分支上添加sigmoid线性门，在推理时根据门值对token排序，使用每层预算跳过低重要性token，该方法可在预训练模型上稳定微调。

Result: 在长形式推理任务中节省15%计算量同时保持90%以上基线准确率；在指令调优模型上，全计算时获得准确率提升，在50%节省时匹配基线质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip提供了一种稳定有效的层跳过机制，学习到的门控机制揭示了transformer信息流模式，并能与量化、剪枝和自推测解码等技术轻松结合。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机基准测试，评估LLMs在不确定性下的顺序决策能力，发现Qwen3-4B模型在最佳臂选择率上达到89.2%，超越了传统方法和更大规模的LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs仅使用自然语言在不确定性下进行顺序决策的能力，目前这一领域研究不足。

Method: 创建纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机环境，LLMs仅通过"你获得了一个代币"这样的文本反馈来推断潜在奖励结构，并与传统算法进行比较。

Result: 大多数LLMs表现不如基线算法，但Qwen3-4B达到了89.2%的最佳臂选择率，显著优于更大的LLMs和传统方法。

Conclusion: 概率推理能力可以从纯语言中涌现，该基准测试为评估自然主义、非数值环境中的决策能力迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种让语言模型动态自主调整每个输入token计算步数的监督训练方法，模型可以通过输出<don't know>请求额外计算步骤，获得<pause>标记来获得更多计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让语言模型能够根据输入复杂度动态分配计算资源，在不确定时请求更多计算时间以提高准确性。

Method: 提出了Catch Your Breath损失函数类别，包括CYB-AP（随时预测）、CYB-VA（变分方法）和CYB-DP（计算预算惩罚）三种方法，将输出选择建模为具有时间成本的序列决策问题。

Result: CYB模型仅需基线模型1/3的训练数据即可达到相同性能，比带暂停的交叉熵损失模型少用一半数据。模型能够根据token复杂度和上下文自适应调整处理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法使语言模型能够智能地请求额外计算步骤，在需要时提高准确性，同时有效利用计算资源，展示了token级复杂度感知能力。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Result: 在需求工程领域的概念验证中，使用分类器辅助模块成功提高了软件需求生成的质量。

Conclusion: PAGE提供了一种简单、模块化的架构，易于适应不同任务，有效提升文本生成模型的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

TL;DR: 本文主张在LLM社会模拟中采用开放式文本生成方法，而非传统的封闭式多选或简答格式，以更真实地模拟社会现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM社会模拟大多局限于多选或简答格式，忽视了LLM的生成性本质。这种封闭设计无法捕捉真实的社会观点和推理过程。

Method: 提出基于自由文本的开放式社会模拟方法，借鉴调查方法学和NLP最新进展，强调捕捉主题、观点和推理过程。

Result: 开放式方法能改善测量和设计，探索未预料观点，减少研究者偏见，捕捉表达性和个体性，辅助预测试，提升方法效用。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发新的实践和评估框架，充分利用LLM的开放式生成多样性，促进NLP与社会科学协同发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

Motivation: 评估现代大语言模型在无结构文本分类任务中的实际表现，了解其分类准确性和可靠性，为改进模型性能提供依据。

Method: 使用8,660个人工标注样本和统一零样本提示，评估10个LLMs在IAB 2.2层次分类法上的表现，采用经典指标和LLM特定指标，并开发集成方法进行对比。

Result: 当代LLMs平均准确率34%，精确率42%，召回率45%，F1分数41%，存在较高的幻觉和膨胀比率。集成方法显著提高准确率，减少膨胀，完全消除幻觉。

Conclusion: 单纯扩大模型规模和架构改进不能保证更好的分类准确性，协调多个模型的集成方法比单纯扩大规模更有效，可能达到或超越人类专家性能。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Method: 提出THTB框架，结合质量过滤和内在/外在难度评分，为SFT提供可解释和可量化的数据选择和标注指导标准。

Result: 实验表明，THTB仅使用5%数据训练的模型就能超越全数据集训练，在垂直领域仅用2%数据训练的模型也能超越更大数据集训练的模型。

Conclusion: THTB在数据选择和标注指导方面具有显著优势，展示了在领域适应方面的强大潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

*Misam Abbas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种作者归属机制：固定风格嵌入和指令调优的LLM法官(GPT-4o)，在包含6个领域的平行语料库上进行测试，发现两种方法在不同领域各有优势，表明作者归属需要混合策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型生成的文本质量接近人类写作，作者归属变得越来越困难，需要开发有效的归属机制来区分人类和AI生成的内容。

Method: 使用Human AI Parallel Corpus数据集，包含6个领域的600个平衡实例，每个实例包含人类提示、黄金延续和LLM生成的延续。比较固定风格嵌入和GPT-4o LLM法官两种归属机制的性能。

Result: 风格嵌入在GPT延续上表现更好(82% vs 68%)，LLM法官在LLaMA延续上略优(85% vs 81%)但无统计显著性。LLM法官在小说和学术文本中显著优于风格嵌入，而风格嵌入在口语和剧本对话中表现更好。

Conclusion: 作者归属是一个多维问题，需要混合策略。两种方法在不同领域各有优势，LLM法官对语义敏感，风格嵌入对结构特征敏感。提供了开源框架支持可复现性。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing
this work.

TL;DR: 窄域微调会在LLM激活中产生强烈偏差，这些偏差可通过模型差异分析来理解微调领域，并可用于生成类似微调数据格式和内容的文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究窄域微调如何影响LLM激活，探索这些偏差是否包含关于微调领域的关键信息，并评估使用此类模型作为更广泛微调研究代理的现实性。

Method: 使用模型差异分析工具，分析随机文本前几个token的激活差异，并通过在模型激活中添加这些差异来引导文本生成。创建基于LLM的可解释性代理来理解微调领域。

Result: 窄域微调在LLM激活中产生显著偏差，这些偏差反映了训练目标。使用偏差信息的代理性能显著优于基线代理。混合预训练数据可减轻这些偏差。

Conclusion: 窄域微调模型在其激活中具有训练目标的显著痕迹，这对AI安全和可解释性研究具有重要启示，需要开发更真实的案例研究。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

TL;DR: RAID是一个针对大语言模型的越狱攻击框架，通过优化对抗性后缀来绕过安全机制，在保持流畅性的同时诱导受限内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在各种任务上表现出色，但仍然容易受到越狱攻击的威胁，这些攻击能够绕过安全机制。

Method: RAID将离散标记松弛为连续嵌入，通过联合目标优化：(i)鼓励受限响应，(ii)加入拒绝感知正则化器引导激活远离拒绝方向，(iii)应用连贯性项保持语义合理性和非冗余性。优化后使用批评引导的解码过程将嵌入映射回标记。

Result: 在多个开源大语言模型上的实验表明，RAID相比最近的基准方法，以更少的查询和更低的计算成本实现了更高的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了嵌入空间正则化对于理解和缓解大语言模型越狱漏洞的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL)框架，通过从示例中提取抽象模式来增强语言模型的推理能力，在GPQA数据集上性能提升最高达36.19%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统示例驱动的上下文学习缺乏在抽象层面的知识检索和转移模块，受认知科学中模式理论的启发，认为人类通过激活已有心理框架来理解新信息。

Method: 从先验示例中提取推理过程的认知构建块表示，创建抽象模式（轻量级、结构化的关键推理步骤模板），用于增强模型面对新问题时的推理过程。

Result: 实验表明，大语言模型缺乏隐式形成和利用基于模式的学习表示能力，但显式的基于模式的支架能显著提升性能，在GPQA化学和物理问题上性能提升最高达36.19%。

Conclusion: SA-ICL不仅连接了从模式启动到思维链提示的不同ICL策略，还为增强LLMs中类人推理开辟了新路径，同时减少了对演示数量的依赖并增强了可解释性。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在算术任务上表现不佳，现有研究主要关注输出或提示策略，而缺乏对模型内部算术计算结构的研究。

Method: 构建包含三个操作数和两个运算符的算术表达式数据集，使用logit lens、线性分类探针和UMAP几何可视化等可解释性技术分析模型内部表示。

Result: 中间计算存在于残差流中（特别是在MLP块之后），模型在注意力层后线性编码每个运算符的优先级。

Conclusion: LLMs确实在内部表示中编码运算符优先级，并提出了部分嵌入交换技术来修改运算符优先级。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

TL;DR: 提出了KRLM模型来解决基于LLM的知识图谱推理中的知识扭曲和生成幻觉问题，通过统一协调LLM知识与KG上下文，在25个真实世界数据集上表现出显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的知识图谱基础模型在处理不确定KG组件时，LLM的内在知识可能被稀疏的KG上下文所掩盖，导致知识扭曲，同时难以完全约束生成幻觉，限制了推理结果的可信度。

Method: 设计了知识推理语言指令格式和分词器来对齐LLM知识与KG表示；提出了KRL注意力层，通过动态知识记忆机制协调内在LLM知识与额外KG上下文；设计了结构感知的下一个实体预测器，将推理结果严格约束在可信知识域内。

Result: 在25个真实世界归纳知识图谱推理数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，KRLM在零样本推理和微调场景中都具有显著优势。

Conclusion: KRLM模型通过统一协调LLM知识与KG上下文，有效解决了知识扭曲和生成幻觉问题，提升了知识图谱推理的可信度和性能。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot
reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理式RAG系统在处理复杂多跳问题时仍存在困难，其中间推理能力尚未得到充分探索，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 通过分析最先进系统的输出，识别常见任务和所需核心能力，构建典型LLM错误分类法，设计针对性评估问题。

Result: 实验表明，具备更强RAGCap性能的"慢思考"模型在端到端任务中表现更好，验证了基准的有效性。

Conclusion: 增强中间推理能力对提升代理式RAG系统性能至关重要，RAGCap-Bench为评估和改善这些能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辩论实验依赖有标准答案的数据集，忽略了说谎的主观维度——说谎需要相信所辩护的主张是错误的。本研究旨在测试语言模型是否会采用迎合策略来最大化说服力。

Method: 测量语言模型的先验信念，然后让辩手在故意与其先验信念冲突的法官角色面前辩论，比较顺序和同时两种辩论协议，评估论点质量和说服力。

Result: 模型倾向于辩护与法官立场一致的立场而非自身先验信念；顺序辩论对第二位辩手存在显著偏见；与先验信念一致的辩护更具说服力；但与先验信念不一致的论点在质量评估中得分更高。

Conclusion: 这些结果有助于人类法官提供更高质量的训练信号，促进更对齐的AI系统，同时揭示了语言模型中说服动态的重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Motivation: 现有的深度研究代理在处理复杂问答任务时面临挑战，因为语言模型通常未针对长时程推理和探索进行优化。现有方法缺乏对难度和质量的细粒度控制，且难以评估数据本身的有效性。

Method: 使用基线网络代理在数据合成中扮演多重角色：尝试回答问题、验证事实性、检查替代答案和执行过滤。采用基于强网络代理蒸馏的受控训练设置来评估合成方法的有效性。

Result: 在多个基于网络的基准测试中，尽管数据集较小，但训练出的网络代理比使用现有数据集的代理表现更好。数据展现出两倍的工具使用多样性，模型能实现更强性能同时避免重复的工具调用行为。

Conclusion: 该数据合成方法能生成高质量的训练数据，有效提升网络代理在复杂问答任务中的表现，特别是在工具使用多样性和避免重复行为方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

Motivation: 反驳当前将语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比的趋势，质疑可读性在小语言模型能力涌现中的关键作用，主张更精确地理解支持小模型能力涌现的实际属性。

Method: 构建具有匹配结构但可读性不同的合成数据集，比较小语言模型在不同可读性文本上的训练效果，并分析统计简单性（通过n-gram多样性衡量）与学习能力的关系。

Result: 模型在复杂成人水平文本上的表现与简化语言相当，甚至训练过程中连贯性发展更快；统计简单性是比可读性更强的学习能力预测指标。

Conclusion: 可读性本身并不能预测小语言模型的连贯性或学习效率，统计简单性才是更重要的因素，这提醒我们不应在没有实证基础的情况下将语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

Motivation: 化学元素属性数据对材料设计至关重要，但许多属性难以直接测量。传统数值分析方法无法有效建模复杂关系，且现有AI方法存在幻觉和缺乏可解释性问题。

Method: 使用语言模型从维基百科文本生成元素的通用嵌入(Global)和属性突出向量(Local)，并设计基于自注意力的测试时训练方法来减少回归误差。

Result: 成功开发了Element2Vec方法，能够有效表示化学元素，解决了文本分布差异和数据稀疏的挑战。

Conclusion: 这项工作为材料科学中AI驱动发现铺平了道路，提供了更准确和可解释的元素属性预测方法。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM在测试时扩展中表现不稳定，简单多数投票有时反而优于标准PRM选择方法，需要找到更有效利用PRM验证信号的方法。

Method: 开发理论框架分析LLM和PRM信号的最优组合策略，提出加权聚合方法，并通过预计算校准权重函数来优化模型间复杂交互。

Result: 在5个LLM和7个PRM上的实验表明，校准方法显著提升TTS效率，仅用21.3%计算量就超越传统加权多数投票性能。

Conclusion: 投资更智能的聚合策略比单纯扩展测试时计算更能获得性能提升，为PRM在TTS中的有效应用提供了新路径。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

*Ye Yuan,Mohammad Amin Shabani,Siqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FACTS是一种快速、准确且隐私合规的表格摘要方法，通过离线模板生成实现查询导向的表格摘要，解决了现有方法在推理能力、效率和隐私方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格摘要方法存在多个问题：表格到文本模型需要昂贵微调且推理能力有限，基于提示的LLM方法有token限制和效率问题且暴露敏感数据，现有代理流程缺乏鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: FACTS通过离线生成包含SQL查询和Jinja2模板的模板，这些模板可在共享相同模式的多个表格中重复使用，仅向LLM发送表格模式以确保隐私合规。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，FACTS持续优于基线方法，证明了其作为实际查询导向表格摘要解决方案的有效性。

Conclusion: FACTS通过离线模板生成方法，提供了一种快速、准确且隐私合规的表格摘要解决方案，适用于现实世界的查询导向表格摘要任务。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

### [55] [An LLM-Powered AI Agent Framework for Holistic IoT Traffic Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13925)
*Daniel Adu Worae,Spyridon Mastorakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于LLM的AI代理框架，将原始数据包捕获转换为结构化语义表示，用于物联网网络流量的交互式分析，通过混合检索显著提升评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网网络产生多样化高流量数据，需要跨层解释行为、协议和上下文，而不仅仅是孤立检测，以获取有意义的安全洞察。

Method: 集成特征提取、基于Transformer的异常检测、数据包和流摘要、威胁情报增强以及检索增强问答的AI代理框架，使用混合检索（词法和语义搜索结合重排序）。

Result: 在多个物联网捕获数据和六个开放模型上的实验评估显示，混合检索相比仅密集检索显著改善了BLEU、ROUGE、METEOR和BERTScore结果，系统分析表明CPU、GPU和内存开销低。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了对物联网网络流量的全面高效解释，证明了混合检索方法在提升分析质量方面的有效性。

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

*Congying Liu,Xingyuan Wei,Peipei Liu,Yiqing Shen,Yanxu Mao,Tiehan Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BioMedSearch是一个基于大语言模型的多源生物医学信息检索框架，通过整合文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，结合子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建和多源信息过滤，显著提升了复杂生物医学问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生物医学领域生成的答案缺乏科学严谨性，无法访问权威生物医学数据库，经常捏造蛋白质功能、相互作用和结构细节，偏离真实信息，因此需要开发能够整合多源权威信息的检索框架。

Method: 提出BioMedSearch框架，集成文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，通过子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建和多源信息过滤来生成高质量问答结果。

Result: 在包含3000个问题的BioMedMCQs数据集上测试，BioMedSearch在所有推理级别上都显著优于基线模型：Level 1准确率从59.1%提升到91.9%；Level 2从47.0%提升到81.0%；Level 3从36.3%提升到73.4%。

Conclusion: BioMedSearch通过整合多源生物医学信息检索，有效解决了大语言模型在生物医学领域缺乏科学严谨性的问题，在复杂生物医学问答任务中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and
BioMedMCQs are available at: https://github.com/CyL-ucas/BioMed_Search

*Shuo Xing,Junyuan Hong,Yifan Wang,Runjin Chen,Zhenyu Zhang,Ananth Grama,Zhengzhong Tu,Zhangyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis：持续接触垃圾网络文本会导致大语言模型认知能力下降。通过控制实验发现，在垃圾数据上持续预训练会显著损害模型的推理、长文本理解、安全性和道德品质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据质量对LLM认知能力的因果影响，验证垃圾网络文本是否会导致模型认知退化。

Method: 使用Twitter/X语料构建垃圾和控制数据集，通过两种正交操作化方法（M1：参与度，M2：语义质量），在4个LLM上进行控制实验，匹配token规模和训练操作。

Result: 垃圾数据训练导致推理能力显著下降（Hedges' g>0.3），在ARC-Challenge和RULER-CWE等任务上性能大幅降低。错误分析发现思维跳跃是主要病变，指令微调和干净数据预训练只能部分恢复能力。

Conclusion: 数据质量是LLM能力退化的因果驱动因素，应将持续预训练的数据筛选视为训练时安全问题，并建议对部署的LLM进行常规"认知健康检查"。

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在生物医学领域药物安全预测中的可靠性，特别是是否会将临床无关的社会人口学信息纳入不良事件预测。

Method: 使用FDA不良事件报告系统结构化数据和基于角色的评估框架，评估ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B在不同社会人口学特征角色下的表现。

Result: 发现系统性预测准确性差异，不利群体被分配更高不良事件预测概率，识别出显性偏见和隐性偏见两种模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物警戒应用中存在严重风险，临床部署前亟需公平性评估协议和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 通过指令检索而非生成的方式，为小语言模型提供结构化推理指导，在医学、法律和数学问答任务上显著提升性能，无需额外微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型(SLMs)在本地硬件上运行高效，具有隐私保护、低成本等优势，但在多步推理和领域知识任务上表现不佳，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 构建指令语料库：将相似训练问题分组，通过GPT-5生成指令。推理时SLM检索最相关指令并遵循其步骤，提供结构化推理指导而非文本段落。

Result: 在MedQA(医学考试)、MMLU专业法律和MathQA上评估3B-14B参数模型，指令检索带来一致性能提升：MedQA提升9.4%，MMLU法律提升7.9%，MathQA提升5.1%。

Conclusion: 简洁指令优于长指令，改进幅度强烈依赖于模型家族和内在推理能力，指令检索是提升小语言模型推理性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了MTI框架，通过仅在不确定位置应用选择性CFG干预和轻量级负提示引导，以最小开销提升推理准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现推理不确定性高度局部化，只有一小部分高熵标记主导影响输出正确性，这为高效测试时干预提供了机会。

Method: MTI包括：选择性CFG干预（仅在不确定位置应用分类器自由引导）和轻量级负提示引导（重用主模型的KV缓存来高效近似无条件解码）。

Result: 在通用、编程和STEM任务上获得一致提升，Qwen3-8B-Base在八个基准上平均提升1.35%，Qwen3-32B-Reasoning在AIME2024上提升5%，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MTI证明了通过局部化干预策略可以在保持效率的同时显著提升推理性能，为测试时优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

Motivation: 由于现实世界RAG系统的复杂性，存在许多导致错误输出的潜在原因。理解实践中可能发生的错误范围对于稳健部署至关重要。

Method: 提出了RAG系统错误类型的新分类法，整理了错误RAG响应的标注数据集，并开发了与分类法一致的自动评估方法。

Result: 创建了包含错误类型标注的RAG响应数据集，并提供了可用于开发过程中跟踪和解决错误的自动评估方法。

Conclusion: 该分类法和评估工具有助于更好地理解和解决RAG系统中的错误，提高系统可靠性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型开发依赖大规模训练语料，但大多数语料的许可状态不明确，限制了真正开放模型的发展。对于非英语语言，特别是德语，公开许可文本仍然严重稀缺。

Method: 通过从41个已建立的数据提供商系统性地获取可验证许可的数据，构建处理管道实施全面的质量过滤、去重和文本格式修复，确保异构文本源的质量一致性。

Result: 创建了包含154.56亿个token的高质量德语文本集合，涵盖法律、科学、文化、政治、新闻、经济和网络文本等7个领域，所有子集至少具有CC-BY-SA 4.0或等效许可。

Conclusion: 德国Commons解决了公开许可德语预训练数据的关键缺口，使开发真正开放的德语语言模型成为可能，同时发布了语料构建和数据过滤代码，确保完全可重现和可扩展。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

TL;DR: CRaFT是一个基于解释的多语言评估框架，用于评估大型语言模型在跨文化背景下的推理能力，通过四个可解释指标来衡量文化理解而非仅靠答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法仅关注答案准确性，无法反映模型真正的文化理解能力，需要开发新的评估框架来评估LLMs在不同文化背景下的推理过程。

Method: 使用CRaFT框架，基于世界价值观调查中的50个文化相关问题，翻译成阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和西班牙语，评估三个模型(GPT、DeepSeek、FANAR)在2100多个答案-解释对上的表现。

Result: 结果显示显著的跨语言推理差异：阿拉伯语降低流畅性，孟加拉语增强流畅性，西班牙语保持稳定。GPT跨语言适应能力更强但一致性较低，FANAR推理稳定但僵化。

Conclusion: LLMs的文化意识不是固有的，而是通过语言框架显现的。CRaFT为评估多语言环境中的跨文化推理提供了新视角，为构建文化适应性语言模型提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

Conclusion: 大语言模型在抽象推理任务中存在语言偏见，英语模态通常具有优势，模型类型也会影响性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Result: 发现了一系列文献中未识别过的可解释的语音语义对齐模式，以及跨语言模式；对5种先前假设的语音语义对齐进行了分析，部分得到支持，部分结果混杂。

Conclusion: 语音语义象似性在大规模跨语言研究中确实存在可量化的系统性关系，既有新的发现，也有对传统假设的验证。

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

Result: 在增量指令多轮任务中，ERGO相比标准基线平均性能提升56.6%，峰值性能能力提升24.7%，性能变异性降低35.3%。

Conclusion: 将不确定性作为首要信号而非需要消除的干扰，能够显著提升对话AI的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

TL;DR: DROID是一个紧凑的端到端框架，通过结合通用语义编码器和领域特定编码器的双编码器表示，实现了强大的超出范围意图检测，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超出范围意图检测方法依赖强分布假设或辅助校准模块，需要更紧凑、鲁棒的端到端解决方案。

Method: 使用双编码器架构：通用句子编码器用于广泛语义泛化，领域自适应Transformer去噪自编码器用于领域特定上下文区分，结合轻量级分支分类器和单一校准阈值。

Result: 仅使用150万可训练参数，在多个意图基准测试中持续优于最新基线，已知意图macro-F1提升6-15%，超出范围意图提升8-20%，在低资源设置中收益最显著。

Conclusion: 双编码器表示结合简单校准可以为神经对话系统提供鲁棒、可扩展且可靠的超出范围意图检测。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

TL;DR: 提出RLSR方法替代SFT，通过强化学习框架利用SFT数据集提升基础模型的指令跟随能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于SFT


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如SFT、RLHF等用于提升LLM的指令跟随能力和推理能力，但SFT仅使用下一词预测目标，而RFT展示了RL方法在特定领域适应的有效性。受RFT启发，希望将RL框架应用于广泛的SFT数据集来提升基础模型的指令跟随能力

Method: RLSR方法：基础模型为每个提示生成多个响应，在语义嵌入空间中计算生成响应与人工标注响应之间的余弦相似度作为奖励分数，通过强化学习优化模型

Result: RLSR直接替代SFT时，在AlpacaEval上的胜率从21.01%提升至26.34%；当SFT与RLSR结合时，胜率进一步提升至30.73%，显著优于单独使用SFT

Conclusion: RLSR能够有效替代或增强SFT，通过强化学习框架利用现有SFT数据集显著提升模型的指令跟随能力，为LLM的后训练优化提供了新的有效方法

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型角色扮演代理的角色保真度常因手动创建的角色配置文件(如精选信息和个性特征)而受损，缺乏与目标个体对齐的验证。

Method: DPRF框架通过自由形式或基于理论的结构化分析，迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的认知差异，并精炼角色配置文件以减轻这些差异。

Result: 在四个不同的行为预测场景(正式辩论、社交媒体帖子、公开访谈、电影评论)上使用五个LLM进行评估，DPRF相比基线角色配置能持续显著改善行为对齐，并在模型和场景间具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该工作为创建高保真角色配置文件和增强下游应用(如用户模拟、社会研究、个性化AI)的有效性提供了稳健的方法论。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

TL;DR: LiteStage是一个针对多阶段推理的延迟感知层跳过框架，通过阶段级离线搜索和在线置信度早期退出来平衡效率与准确性，在三个基准测试中实现了1.70倍加速且准确率损失小于4.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理虽然能提升小语言模型的推理能力，但带来了延迟增加的问题。现有自适应加速技术（如层跳过）由于阶段级跳过敏感度变化和冗余输出令牌生成两个关键挑战，难以在效率与准确性之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出LiteStage框架，结合阶段级离线搜索（分配最优层预算）和在线置信度生成早期退出（抑制不必要的解码），以解决多阶段推理中的效率问题。

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试上的实验表明，LiteStage实现了最高1.70倍的加速，准确率损失小于4.0%，优于先前的无训练层跳过方法。

Conclusion: LiteStage有效解决了多阶段推理中的延迟问题，通过智能的层跳过策略在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

TL;DR: 提出Flip-Flop Consistency (F²C)无监督训练方法，通过共识交叉熵和表示对齐损失来提高LLM对提示扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对同一提示的不同表述时经常产生不一致的答案，这影响了模型的可靠性和稳定性。

Method: F²C包含两个关键组件：共识交叉熵（CCE）使用多数投票创建硬伪标签；表示对齐损失将低置信度和非多数预测器拉向共识。

Result: 在11个数据集上的评估显示，F²C将观察一致性提高了11.62%，平均F1分数提高了8.94%，跨格式性能方差降低了3.29%。

Conclusion: F²C是增强LLM在提示扰动下一致性、性能和泛化能力的有效无监督方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MoM框架，将RAG从被动分块转变为主动理解文档记忆，通过模拟专家生成逻辑大纲、多路径采样评估、反向推理训练SLM，以及三层检索机制，解决现有RAG系统的文本分块问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG范式在处理相关文本块时限制了知识内化和推理能力，需要模拟人类阅读认知过程来提升文档理解能力。

Method: MoM框架：1) 使用LLM模拟领域专家生成文档逻辑大纲指导结构化分块；2) 多路径采样和多视角评估机制选择最优文档记忆；3) 反向推理策略训练SLM获得类人阅读能力；4) 三层文档记忆检索机制。

Result: 在三个不同领域的广泛实验表明，MoM框架不仅解决了现有RAG系统的文本分块挑战，为LLM提供语义完整的文档记忆，还为SLM实现以人为中心的智能文本处理铺平了道路。

Conclusion: MoM框架通过主动文档记忆提取和类人认知模拟，显著提升了RAG系统的知识内化和推理能力，为小语言模型实现智能文本处理提供了有效路径。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

Motivation: 研究训练数据与语言模型行为之间的关系，特别是如何通过干预数据来测试关于数据如何影响模型行为的假设。

Method: 通过"重写历史"的方式干预数据批次，包括从基准中选择评估项目、匹配相关文档、修改文档，然后重新训练模型检查点并测量效果。使用共现统计和信息检索方法识别可能有助于知识学习的文档。

Result: 结果补充了过去将共现与模型行为联系起来的观察分析，同时表明现有的识别相关训练文档的方法不能完全解释语言模型正确回答知识问题的能力。

Conclusion: 提出了一个可复用的实验方法，研究人员可以遵循该方法来进一步测试关于训练数据如何影响模型行为的假设，代码已公开以促进未来工作。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Method: 研究训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性对多语言嵌入模型效果的影响，重点关注硬负样本的引入和任务多样性的作用。

Result: 发现增加训练数据规模初期有效但收益递减，硬负样本对提升检索准确性至关重要，任务多样性比语言多样性对性能贡献更大。最终开发出300M参数模型，检索性能媲美7B模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化训练策略，小型多语言模型可以在检索任务中达到与大型模型相当的性能，硬负样本和任务多样性是关键因素。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

Motivation: 现有护栏模型存在两个主要限制：只能输出二元安全标签，无法适应不同领域的安全容忍度；需要完整模型输出才能进行安全检查，与流式LLM推理不兼容。

Method: 提出Qwen3Guard系列模型，包含生成式变体（将安全分类转为指令跟随任务，实现三分类判断）和流式变体（引入token级分类头，支持实时安全监控）。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全审核解决方案，所有模型在Apache 2.0许可下公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for

Motivation: 多跳问答需要收集多个证据片段，传统检索方法在复杂问题上面临精度和召回率的平衡挑战。

Method: 使用三个专门代理：问题分析器分解问题，选择器聚焦精度选择相关上下文，加法器聚焦召回率补充缺失证据，通过迭代交互获得紧凑而全面的支持段落。

Result: 在四个多跳问答基准测试（HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA、MuSiQue、MultiHopRAG）上一致优于强基线方法，实现了更高的检索准确率并过滤了干扰内容。

Conclusion: 该代理检索系统能够为下游QA模型提供更少无关信息但更准确的支持证据，从而超越全上下文答案准确率。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

*Md Mahadi Hasan Nahid,Davood Rafiei,Weiwei Zhang,Yong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文感知的双向模式检索框架，将模式链接作为独立问题处理，显著提升了Text-to-SQL系统的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统中关键但未被充分探索的组件，现有方法主要关注SQL生成而忽视了相关模式元素的检索，导致产生幻觉和执行失败。

Method: 采用双向模式检索框架，结合两种互补策略：表优先检索后列选择，以及列优先检索后表选择，并辅以问题分解、关键词提取和关键短语提取技术。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider等挑战性基准测试中，该方法显著提高了模式召回率并减少了误报，SQL生成性能持续优于全模式基线，接近oracle性能，无需查询优化。

Conclusion: 模式链接是提升Text-to-SQL准确性和效率的有力杠杆，该方法将完整模式和完美模式设置之间的性能差距缩小了50%。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术论文数量激增导致科学家难以及时跟踪最新研究成果，现有论文数据库仅支持相似性匹配和基本分类，无法深入探索概念间的关联网络。

Method: 基于OpenAlex知识图谱分析近8000篇开源论文数据，提出基于提示工程的关键概念路径分析方法，利用小语言模型进行概念提取和创新点识别，构建基于知识图谱约束机制的智能体。

Result: 发现论文关键概念路径分布模式与创新点和稀有路径存在强相关性，通过对Qwen和DeepSeek模型微调，在准确性方面取得显著提升，模型已在Hugging Face平台公开。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决学术论文分析中的概念关系挖掘问题，为科学家提供更深入的研究洞察。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注英语或高资源语言，缺乏对多语言和跨语言数学推理的全面评估。

Method: 构建包含高、中、低资源语言的平行多语言数据集，系统评估多种模型在零样本、思维链和代码切换推理范式下的表现。

Result: LLM在不同语言间的数学推理能力存在显著差异，低资源语言环境下性能明显下降。

Conclusion: LLM在多语言数学推理方面仍存在持续缺陷，特别是在低资源语言环境中表现不佳。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

*Marwa Abdulhai,Ryan Cheng,Aryansh Shrivastava,Natasha Jaques,Yarin Gal,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型在对话中的欺骗行为，提出信念错位指标来量化欺骗，发现LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，RLHF训练模型仍有43%的欺骗率，并提出多轮强化学习方法将欺骗行为减少77.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在客服、教育、医疗等应用中与数百万人互动，但其产生欺骗性输出的能力（无论有意还是无意）带来了严重的安全隐患。LLM行为的不可预测性，加上对幻觉、错误信息和用户操纵的防护不足，使其滥用成为严重的现实风险。

Method: 提出信念错位指标来量化欺骗，在四种不同对话场景中评估欺骗行为，使用五种已建立的欺骗检测指标和提出的新指标。引入多轮强化学习方法来微调LLMs以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 新提出的欺骗测量指标与人类判断的相关性比任何现有测试指标都更紧密。LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，当被提示欺骗时，欺骗性相对于基线可增加31%。RLHF训练模型平均仍有43%的欺骗率。多轮强化学习方法将欺骗行为减少了77.6%。

Conclusion: 对话中的欺骗行为是在交互历史中发展的行为，其有效评估和缓解需要超越单话语分析。提出的多轮强化学习方法能显著减少LLMs的欺骗行为，为解决这一重要安全问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病早期检测对患者有益，语言能力变化是AD的重要标志，可用于早期诊断。

Method: 创建基于Doc2Vec和ELMo的混合词嵌入获取句子困惑度分数，添加语言特征分析语法和语义，通过逻辑回归和超参数调优构建分类模型。

Result: 达到91%分类准确率和97%AUC，优于现有最佳NLP模型的88%准确率，模型稳定性高（准确率标准差0.0403，AUC标准差0.0174）。

Conclusion: 该方法准确稳定，可作为AD大规模筛查方法和医生诊断的补充检查。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在角色扮演中能否忠实一致地表现版本特定角色，特别是超级英雄在不同宇宙中的不同版本，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Method: 创建包含Canon Events（事实回忆）和Moral Dilemmas（道德困境）两个任务的基准测试，采用Think-Act Matching指标评估推理与行动的一致性。

Result: 发现思维链提示对弱模型有益但会降低强模型的准确性，跨版本泛化仍是主要挑战，模型通常在思考或行动中表现良好但很少两者兼备。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

Motivation: 高性能医疗大模型通常需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了资源受限医疗机构的可及性。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：置信度检测模块评估主模型确定性，自适应路由机制将低置信度查询导向具有互补知识的辅助模型进行协作推理。

Result: 在PubMedQA上达到95.0%，MedMCQA上达到78.0%的优异表现，显著优于单模型方法和统一推理策略。

Conclusion: 战略性模型合作为改进医疗AI系统提供了实用且计算高效的途径，对资源受限环境中的先进医疗AI民主化具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在字符级扰动下的鲁棒性，旨在防止LLM在在线考试系统等场景中的滥用，并评估部署LLMs的可靠性风险。

Method: 引入一种插入不可见Unicode控制字符的实用方法，通过字符级噪声插入来破坏tokenization并降低信噪比，全面评估模型、问题和噪声相关配置。

Result: 尽管存在强混淆导致tokenization碎片化和信噪比显著降低，许多LLM仍表现出显著的性能保持能力。

Conclusion: LLMs在低层级扰动下表现出鲁棒性，这揭示了LLM滥用的风险和在不同应用中部署LLMs的可靠性问题。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Motivation: 现有问答系统在处理需要跨多个重复性文档进行信息聚合的pluri-hop问题时表现不佳，特别是在召回敏感、需要穷尽检索且对遗漏文档高度敏感的场景下。

Method: 提出了PluriHopRAG方法，包含两个关键步骤：(1) 将查询分解为文档级子问题；(2) 使用交叉编码器在昂贵的LLM推理前过滤无关文档。

Result: 在PluriHopWIND数据集上测试，传统RAG方法F1得分不超过40%，而PluriHopRAG实现了18-52%的相对F1得分提升。

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND数据集暴露了当前问答系统在重复性、干扰文档丰富的语料库上的局限性，PluriHopRAG证明了穷尽检索和早期过滤相比top-k方法的优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

Motivation: 自杀是全球重要的公共卫生问题，现有研究主要关注单个社交媒体帖子的自杀表达检测，但忽略了用户通过历史帖子和互动评论随时间展现意图的重要性。

Method: 构建了基于Reddit的高质量标注数据集，采用基于C-SSRS的四标签标注框架，结合用户发帖历史和评论数据，使用大语言模型进行实验分析。

Result: 统计分析和LLM实验结果表明，整合评论树数据能显著提升用户自杀风险水平的区分和预测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为增强高危个体检测准确性提供了新视角，为早期自杀干预策略奠定了有价值的基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

Method: 构建了包含100个对话会话的多语言基准，用户与基于MBTI维度的心理基础NPC进行五天互动，捕捉自然的日常沟通模式；评估了基于提示和微调的个性化方法。

Result: 建立了首个YNTP基准，为面向用户的语言建模奠定了基础，数据集已公开可用。

Conclusion: YNTP任务能够有效建模用户的精确词汇选择，为开发更符合用户个人沟通风格的语言模型提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for
user-aligned language modeling. The dataset is available at:

capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

Motivation: 语言模型在处理多约束指令时表现不佳，现有强化学习方法依赖外部监督且面临稀疏奖励问题。

Method: 采用约束分解策略和高效的逐约束二元分类，直接从指令生成奖励信号和伪标签进行奖励模型训练。

Result: 在3个领域内和5个领域外数据集上均取得显著改进，包括具有挑战性的代理和多轮指令跟随任务。

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了Explore to Evolve范式来构建可验证的Web代理训练数据，开发了WebAggregator模型，在信息聚合能力上超越GPT-4.1，并创建了WebAggregatorQA评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源深度研究代理主要关注信息检索能力，而忽视了信息聚合这一关键需求，这限制了它们支持深度研究的能力。

Method: 采用Explore to Evolve范式：首先通过主动在线探索从真实网络获取基础信息，然后使用收集的证据自我演化聚合程序，从12种高级逻辑类型中选择、组合和优化操作来合成可验证的QA对。

Result: 构建了包含10K样本的WebAggregatorQA数据集，开发了WebAggregator系列模型，其中8B版本性能匹配GPT-4.1，32B版本在GAIA-text上超越GPT-4.1超过10%，接近Claude-3.7-sonnet。在WebAggregatorQA基准上，Claude-3.7-sonnet仅得28%，GPT-4.1得25.8%。

Conclusion: 即使代理能够检索所有参考资料，在WebAggregatorQA上仍然表现不佳，突显了需要加强Web代理基础模型的信息聚合能力。

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

TL;DR: NLT框架用自然语言输出替代LLM中的编程式JSON工具调用，通过解耦工具选择和响应生成，显著提升工具调用性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统编程式JSON工具调用中的任务干扰和格式约束问题，这些因素会降低工具调用性能

Method: 提出Natural Language Tools框架，将工具选择与响应生成分离，消除任务干扰和格式限制

Result: 在10个模型和6,400次试验中，工具调用准确率提高18.4个百分点，输出方差降低70%，开源模型获益最大

Conclusion: NLT显著提升工具调用性能，改进在提示扰动下保持稳定，并能扩展缺乏原生支持的模型的工具调用能力

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

TL;DR: LiRA框架通过锚定低资源语言到英语语义空间和语言感知推理头，在低资源条件下提升跨语言表示、检索和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在低资源语言上性能不足的问题，由于训练数据有限、机器翻译噪声和跨语言对齐不稳定导致。

Method: 包含两个模块：Arca通过锚定对齐和多智能体协作编码将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间；LaSR在Arca表示基础上添加语言感知轻量推理头，通过一致性正则化统一训练目标。

Result: 在低资源基准测试中（跨语言检索、语义相似性和推理）显示出持续增益和鲁棒性，在少样本和噪声放大设置下表现良好。

Conclusion: LiRA框架有效提升了低资源语言的跨语言表示能力，同时增强了检索和推理的鲁棒性，并发布了多语言产品检索数据集。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的seq2seq共指消解模型虽然性能优异，但在增量设置（如对话）中缺乏灵活性和效率，无法高效处理顺序输入的文本。

Method: 通过提取和重组实体级token，丢弃大部分其他输入token，创建压缩表示来优化seq2seq共指消解模型在增量设置中的效率。

Result: 在OntoNotes上，最佳模型仅比完整前缀增量基线低0.6个CoNLL F1点，同时实现1.8的压缩比；在LitBank上超过了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 在seq2seq共指消解器中丢弃大量token是实现增量共指消解的可行策略，能够在保持性能的同时显著提高效率。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个新数据集和分析框架来评估主权LLMs的社会文化契合度和技术鲁棒性，发现虽然这些模型在支持低资源语言方面有作用，但并不总能很好地服务目标用户，且可能低估安全等关键质量属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主权LLMs的发展趋势显示各国对开发适合自身社会文化和历史背景的LLMs兴趣增长，但缺乏验证这些模型是否与用户社会文化背景契合以及是否保持安全性和技术鲁棒性的框架和数据集。

Method: 构建新数据集并引入分析框架，用于提取和评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素，同时评估其技术鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面发挥有意义的作用，但并不总能满足服务目标用户的主张，且追求这一未经验证的主张可能导致低估安全等关键质量属性。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs需要更广泛的评估，纳入更全面、有根据且实用的标准。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好学习方法在标准基准上表现良好，但当移除客观质量信号时性能显著下降，需要评估模型在主观质量偏好上的真实能力。

Method: 构建包含1,800个人工标注偏好对的数据集，涵盖8种创意写作类型，比较序列奖励模型、零-shot语言模型判断和生成式奖励模型的性能。

Result: 序列奖励模型准确率仅52.7%，零-shot语言模型53.9%，而生成式奖励模型达到81.8%准确率；模型在不同写作类型间方差很大（标准差平均10.1%）。

Conclusion: 成功的偏好建模可能需要中间推理表示而非直接分类，当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非捕捉主观质量偏好。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

Conclusion: CodeSeq通过系统化的数据生成和强化学习方法有效提升了LLMs的归纳推理能力，同时保持了泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本转语音方法在情感表达方面存在不足，要么依赖昂贵的情感标注，要么优化间接目标函数，导致生成的语音虽然准确但情感平淡。

Method: 采用RLAIF机制，利用ASR评估语义准确性，LLM评估韵律情感标签对齐，作为情感表达性和可理解性的直接奖励。通过韵律标签对齐在结构、情感、速度和音调四个维度上增强表达质量。

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上的实验表明，RLAIF-SPA优于Chat-TTS，WER降低26.1%，SIM-O提高9.1%，人工评估提升超过10%。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA框架有效解决了情感语音合成中的表达性问题，通过直接优化语义准确性和韵律情感对齐，显著提升了生成语音的质量和自然度。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

Motivation: 解决当前方法依赖商业LLM成本高、透明度低，以及需要预先知道聚类数量的问题。

Method: 首先让LLM为每个文本生成伪标签，然后在伪标签集上进行多标签分类，基于同一聚类的文本共享更多标签的假设。

Result: 在四个基准测试集上取得了与现有基线相当或更好的结果，方法简单且计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低资源场景，在多个模型和数据集上表现稳定。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗领域的快速发展带来了偏见、隐私侵犯和不平等访问等风险，现有自动风险检测方法可能减少人类对危害产生方式和受影响人群的理解。

Method: 开发了一个人类中心框架，通过生成用户故事和促进多智能体讨论，帮助人们在部署前创造性思考AI系统的潜在利益和危害。

Result: 用户研究表明，阅读故事的用户能够识别更广泛的危害类型，响应分布更均匀；而未阅读故事的用户主要关注隐私和健康（58.3%）。

Conclusion: 故事讲述帮助参与者推测更广泛的危害和利益，更创造性地思考AI对用户的影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

Method: 采用可扩展的自聚合方法，从成功轨迹中提炼一致的推理检查点，无需人工标注或更强的教师模型即可构建问题特定的评分标准，联合利用基于评分标准和结果的奖励。

Result: 在六个多模态推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在专门的评估中显著提高了推理忠实度。

Conclusion: AutoRubric-R1V框架通过自动生成的过程级监督有效解决了多模态推理中的虚假推理问题，提升了推理质量和忠实度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

TL;DR: Pluto是一个用于评估LLM生成Verilog设计效率的基准框架，包含114个问题、自检测试平台和帕累托最优参考实现。实验显示LLM功能正确率达78.3%，但合成效率（面积63.8%、延迟65.9%、功耗64.0%）仍落后于专家设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注功能正确性，缺乏对硬件设计关键指标（面积、延迟、功耗）的全面评估，且缺少优化基线和验证测试平台。

Method: 开发Pluto基准框架，包含114个设计问题，配备自检测试平台和多个帕累托最优参考实现，用于全面评估LLM生成的Verilog代码效率。

Result: 最先进LLM在功能正确性上达到78.3%（pass@1），但在合成效率方面表现较差：面积效率63.8%、延迟效率65.9%、功耗效率64.0%（eff@1）。

Conclusion: 需要像Pluto这样的效率感知评估框架来推动硬件导向的LLM研究发展，当前LLM在硬件设计效率方面仍有显著提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COIG-Writer是一个中文创意写作数据集，包含1,665个精心策划的三元组，涵盖51种文体，每个包含逆向工程提示、详细创作推理过程和最终文本。研究发现创意写作需要过程监督和通用数据的平衡，创意能力具有文化特异性，词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在创意写作方面存在系统性缺陷，特别是在非英语语境中，训练数据稀缺且缺乏过程级监督。为了解决这个问题，需要构建能够捕捉创作过程和输出的数据集。

Method: 通过系统逆向工程高质量文本构建COIG-Writer数据集，包含逆向工程提示、详细创作推理和最终文本的三元组。通过全面实验分析创意写作的两组件模型：叙事逻辑和语言表达。

Result: 发现三个关键见解：1) 过程监督需要与通用数据稳定结合，最佳比例为1:12；2) 创意能力具有文化特异性，中英文表现差距达89.26个百分点；3) 词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关（TTR悖论）。

Conclusion: 创意卓越源于逻辑支架和语言基础的相互作用，类似于数学推理增强但不能替代基础模型中的语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现推理模型的性能和答案分布对答案提取算法高度敏感，需要一种不依赖特定提取规则的方法来获得更可靠的评估结果。

Method: 使用额外模型推理，在原始输入输出前添加"Answer:"提示重新生成答案，然后从重新生成的输出中选择或提取最终答案。

Result: 该方法在数学问题和开放式问答任务中表现出改进的性能和增强的鲁棒性，对提取规则不敏感。

Conclusion: Answer Regeneration框架能够为模型评估提供更可靠的结果，减少对答案提取算法的依赖性。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

TL;DR: 对比分析对比学习(CL)和监督微调(SFT)在LLM重排序中的效果，发现SFT在权重更新方面显著优于CL，导致SFT在LLM重排序中具有一致优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息检索中，BERT编码器使用对比学习更有效，但LLM使用监督微调更有效，这引发了对哪种目标函数更适合LLM重排序及其机制的研究需求。

Method: 将目标函数分解为权重和方向两个组件，通过探测实验比较CL和SFT在统一多模态检索(UMR)中的表现，并进行大规模训练验证。

Result: SFT提供比CL更强的权重方案，而评分方向没有明显差异，SFT在LLM重排序中具有一致优势，并在MRB基准上达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: SFT比CL更适合LLM重排序，主要因为其更强的权重更新机制，这一发现对未来的研究和应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部数据、在线的测试时适应框架，通过自监督优化MoE模型的路由决策，在文本生成过程中持续改进专家选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在部署时由于分布偏移导致路由决策不理想，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，不适用于MoE架构。

Method: 采用两阶段循环：在预填充阶段和定期间隔，基于已生成序列通过自监督优化路由决策；然后正常生成文本，保持修改后的路由器直到下一次适应。通过轻量级加法向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理任务上获得一致性能提升，同时保持对上下文偏移的鲁棒性。例如在HumanEval上获得5.5%提升，与自一致性结合时在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上获得6%平均增益。

Conclusion: 该方法通过在线优化MoE路由决策，无需外部数据即可提升模型性能，具有即插即用特性，能与现有测试时缩放技术自然互补。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管许多语言模型在预训练结束时都会加入“中期训练”阶段来混合更高质量的数据，但这种做法的科学原理和有效性原因尚不明确，需要进行系统性的研究。

Method: 通过从头开始预训练语言模型并在不同领域的有监督微调数据集上进行受控实验，研究了中期训练的效果。还针对中期训练的开始时间和数据混合权重进行了消融实验。

Result: 中期训练在数学和代码领域效果最显著，能持续优于持续预训练，在领域内验证损失和预训练数据遗忘方面表现更好。时间安排比混合权重影响更大，较早引入专业数据能获得更大收益。

Conclusion: 中期训练是一种领域适应技术，相比持续预训练，通过减少遗忘来获得更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用编译器无法有效利用现代空间架构的细粒度数据移动、执行顺序和计算布局控制，需要专门的编译器基础设施来充分利用这类架构的性能潜力。

Method: 基于MLIR构建MLIR-AIR编译器堆栈，定义AIR方言提供异步和分层操作的结构化表示，支持空间调度、跨硬件区域计算分发以及通信与计算重叠。

Result: 在矩阵乘法中达到78.7%的计算效率，性能接近手工优化的MLIR-AIE实现；在多头注意力中仅用约150行代码实现融合实现，高效映射到空间硬件。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR能够将高级结构化控制流转换为有效利用NPU计算结构和内存层次的空间程序，通过编译器管理的调度实现异步执行、分块和通信重叠。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

Motivation: LLM在语义等价输入下经常产生不一致的输出，现有训练数据缺乏一致性关注，且当前微调技术在提升输出一致性方面存在局限。

Result: 融合模型显著提升了输出一致性，相比基线实现了约47.5%的响应相似度改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升工业RAG系统的可靠性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了训练计算量与上下文利用之间的相互作用，为设计更高效的长上下文LLM提供了指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅提升了模型的推理性能，还赋予了其显著的自奖励能力，增强了推理时的扩展性能。

Conclusion: LaSeR通过简单有效的最后一个token自奖励机制，实现了推理和自验证能力的高效统一优化。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first
benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public
resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text
generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even
with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail
metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential
infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling
systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics
research.

TL;DR: 当前多模态生成模型在处理方言文本输入时存在显著性能下降，通过设计编码器缓解策略可同时提升方言性能并保持标准英语性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态生成模型是否能有效处理方言文本输入，因为方言使用者在与生成模型交互时经常使用方言。

Method: 构建包含6种英语方言的大规模基准测试，收集4200+个提示，评估17个图像和视频生成模型，并设计基于编码器的缓解策略。

Result: 当前最先进模型在使用单个方言词时性能下降32.26%-48.17%，提出的方法可将5种方言性能提升至与标准英语相当（+34.4%），且几乎不影响标准英语性能。

Conclusion: 多模态生成模型在处理方言输入时存在严重性能问题，但通过专门的编码器策略可以有效缓解这一问题，实现方言与标准英语的平衡性能。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

TL;DR: 提出IGPO框架，通过信息增益为多轮智能体训练提供密集内在奖励，解决传统结果奖励稀疏性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体在多轮交互中依赖结果奖励，导致奖励稀疏、优势崩溃和信用分配困难等问题

Method: IGPO将每轮交互建模为获取真实信息的过程，基于策略对正确答案概率的边际增长定义轮级内在奖励

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，IGPO在多轮场景下始终优于强基线，实现更高准确性和样本效率

Conclusion: IGPO通过内在奖励机制有效解决了多轮智能体训练中的奖励稀疏问题，显著提升了性能

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

TL;DR: UI-Simulator是一个可扩展的范式，通过生成结构化UI状态和转换来大规模合成训练轨迹，解决了数字代理需要多样化UI轨迹但数据收集成本高昂的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字代理需要多样化的大规模UI轨迹来泛化真实世界任务，但收集此类数据在人工标注、基础设施和工程角度都极其昂贵。

Method: 整合数字世界模拟器生成多样化UI状态，引导式展开过程实现连贯探索，以及轨迹包装器生成高质量多样化训练轨迹。还提出UI-Simulator-Grow目标缩放策略，通过优先处理高影响力任务和合成信息丰富的轨迹变体来实现更快速和数据高效的缩放。

Result: 在WebArena和AndroidWorld上的实验表明，UI-Simulator在鲁棒性方面优于或媲美在真实UI上训练的开源代理，尽管使用较弱的教师模型。UI-Simulator-Grow仅使用Llama-3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型就能达到Llama-3-70B-Instruct的性能。

Conclusion: 目标合成缩放范式具有持续高效增强数字代理的潜力。

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

*Yinxi Li,Yuntian Deng,Pengyu Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了TokDrift框架，用于评估代码大语言模型中子词分词器对语义相同但格式不同的代码片段产生不一致行为的问题。研究发现即使是微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为显著变化，这源于早期嵌入层中分词未能捕捉语法标记边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码LLMs使用的子词分词器（如BPE）基于统计而非语法，导致语义相同的代码片段因格式差异（如空格、标识符命名）而被不同分词，影响模型可靠性。

Method: 提出TokDrift框架，应用语义保持的重写规则创建仅在分词上不同的代码变体，并在9个代码LLMs（包括超过300亿参数的大模型）上进行评估，进行分层分析。

Result: 即使是微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为显著变化。分层分析显示问题源于早期嵌入层，子词分词未能捕捉语法标记边界。

Conclusion: 未对齐的分词是代码理解和生成可靠性的隐藏障碍，未来代码LLMs需要语法感知的分词方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

*Quan Nguyen-Tri,Mukul Ranjan,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Elastic-Cache方法，通过自适应地决定何时刷新和在哪里刷新KV缓存，减少扩散大语言模型中的冗余计算，显著加速解码过程，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个去噪步骤和所有层都重新计算所有token的QKV，但KV状态在大多数步骤中变化很小，特别是在浅层，导致大量冗余计算。

Method: 基于三个观察：(1) 远距离MASK token可作为长度偏置块缓存；(2) KV动态性随深度增加，从深层开始选择性刷新足够；(3) 最受关注token的KV漂移最小。提出Elastic-Cache策略，通过注意力感知漂移测试决定何时刷新，通过深度感知调度决定从哪里刷新。

Result: 在GSM8K（256 tokens）上实现8.7倍加速，长序列上45.1倍加速，HumanEval上4.8倍加速，同时保持比基线更高的准确率，在GSM8K上吞吐量比现有方法高6.8倍。

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache能够有效减少冗余计算，显著加速扩散LLMs的解码过程，同时保持生成质量，实现实际部署。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文提出了新的截断核基估计器及其去偏变体，用于估计具有无界变差跳跃的Itô半鞅的瞬时波动率，将跳跃活动指数的效率边界从Y<4/3提升到Y<20/11，覆盖了几乎整个允许范围Y<2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融计量学中波动率估计在跳跃活动较高时变得特别具有挑战性，这在高度交易的金融证券中经常观察到。

Method: 构建截断核基估计器和去偏变体，使用无界核函数，在更灵活的模型假设下具有更广泛的适用性。

Result: 新方法在跳跃活动指数方面扩展了效率边界，实现了更小的渐近方差，并且在有限样本中显著优于竞争方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的估计器简化了实现过程，在更广泛的模型假设下具有更好的性能，为高跳跃活动下的波动率估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Volatility estimation is a central problem in financial econometrics, but
becomes particularly challenging when jump activity is high, a phenomenon
observed empirically in highly traded financial securities. In this paper, we
revisit the problem of spot volatility estimation for an It\^o semimartingale
with jumps of unbounded variation. We construct truncated kernel-based
estimators and debiased variants that extend the efficiency frontier for spot
volatility estimation in terms of the jump activity index $Y$, raising the
previous bound $Y<4/3$ to $Y<20/11$, thereby covering nearly the entire
admissible range $Y<2$. Compared with earlier work, our approach attains
smaller asymptotic variances through the use of unbounded kernels, is simpler
to implement, and has broader applicability under more flexible model
assumptions. A comprehensive simulation study confirms that our procedures
substantially outperform competing methods in finite samples.

TL;DR: 提出了基于Navier-Stokes偏微分方程的动态空间处理效应边界理论框架，将处理强度定义为时空连续函数，建立了处理效应的标度律，并通过卫星数据和蒙特卡洛模拟验证了方法在边界检测和虚假阳性避免方面的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散处理效应估计方法无法充分捕捉空间处理效应的传播动态和边界演化，需要建立连续函数框架来统一分析处理效应的时空动态特性。

Method: 基于Navier-Stokes偏微分方程构建连续函数框架，利用Kummer合流超几何函数和修正贝塞尔函数的精确自相似解，建立处理效应的标度律τ(d,t)=t^{-α}f(d/t^β)，并通过4200万TROPOMI卫星观测数据进行实证验证。

Result: 实证分析显示NO2污染呈现强指数空间衰减(κ_s=0.004每公里，R²=0.35)，可检测边界达572公里。蒙特卡洛模拟表明在边界检测和虚假阳性避免方面优于离散参数方法(94% vs 27%正确拒绝)。区域异质性分析验证了诊断能力。

Conclusion: 连续函数视角统一了空间计量经济学和数学物理，为环境经济学、银行和医疗保健等领域的边界检测、暴露量化和政策评估提供了理论基础方法。

Abstract: I develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for dynamic spatial treatment
effect boundaries using continuous functional definitions grounded in
Navier-Stokes partial differential equations. Rather than discrete treatment
effect estimators, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as a
continuous function $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous
analysis of propagation dynamics, boundary evolution, and cumulative exposure
patterns. Building on exact self-similar solutions expressible through Kummer
confluent hypergeometric and modified Bessel functions, I establish that
treatment effects follow scaling laws $\tau(d, t) = t^{-\alpha} f(d/t^\beta)$
where exponents characterize diffusion mechanisms. Empirical validation using
42 million TROPOMI satellite observations of NO$_2$ pollution from U.S.
coal-fired power plants demonstrates strong exponential spatial decay
($\kappa_s = 0.004$ per km, $R^2 = 0.35$) with detectable boundaries at 572 km.
Monte Carlo simulations confirm superior performance over discrete parametric
methods in boundary detection and false positive avoidance (94\% vs 27\%
correct rejection). Regional heterogeneity analysis validates diagnostic
capability: positive decay parameters within 100 km confirm coal plant
dominance; negative parameters beyond 100 km correctly signal when urban
sources dominate. The continuous functional perspective unifies spatial
econometrics with mathematical physics, providing theoretically grounded
methods for boundary detection, exposure quantification, and policy evaluation
across environmental economics, banking, and healthcare applications.

<details>

Motivation: 传统的Black-Scholes模型无法充分解释金融时间序列中观察到的超额峰度现象，需要更灵活的模型来捕捉股票价格动态的复杂特征。

Method: 使用拉普拉斯分布作为高斯方差混合模型，通过绝对矩进行更有效的波动率估计；将拉普拉斯模型推广为伽马时间从属的布朗运动，即方差伽马模型，并采用Esscher变换方法为欧式看涨期权定价。

Result: 方差伽马模型能够实证解释对数收益率数据中发现的超额峰度，在假设检验中拒绝了Black-Scholes模型的假设。

Conclusion: 随机时间从属方法为股票价格动态建模提供了更准确的框架，方差伽马模型在捕捉金融时间序列的统计特性方面优于传统模型。

Abstract: This paper explores the concept of random-time subordination in modelling
stock-price dynamics, and We first present results on the Laplace distribution

model to characterise the powerful variance gamma model of Madan et al. as a
Gamma time-subordinated Brownian motion to price European call options via an
Esscher transform method. We find that the Variance Gamma model is able to
empirically explain excess kurtosis found in log-returns data, rejecting a

Motivation: 研究高维随机梯度下降在多类各向异性数据上的训练动态，特别是协方差结构对学习过程的影响，以理解SGD在不同数据分布下的行为特性。

Method: 建立确定性ODE系统来分析高维SGD动态，扩展现有理论到高斯混合数据和大量类别情况，研究各向同性协方差、零一模型和幂律分布协方差三种情况。

Result: 发现了结构相变现象：在零一模型和足够大幂律参数的幂律模型中，SGD更倾向于与投影到"干净方向"（较小方差方向）的类别均值对齐。

Conclusion: 数据协方差的结构性特征显著影响SGD的训练动态，特定协方差结构下SGD会优先学习低方差方向上的信号，这一现象通过数值模拟和理论分析得到验证。

Abstract: We develop a framework for analyzing the training and learning rate dynamics
on a variety of high- dimensional optimization problems trained using one-pass
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with data generated from multiple anisotropic
classes. We give exact expressions for a large class of functions of the
limiting dynamics, including the risk and the overlap with the true signal, in
terms of a deterministic solution to a system of ODEs. We extend the existing
theory of high-dimensional SGD dynamics to Gaussian-mixture data and a large
(growing with the parameter size) number of classes. We then investigate in
detail the effect of the anisotropic structure of the covariance of the data in
the problems of binary logistic regression and least square loss. We study
three cases: isotropic covariances, data covariance matrices with a large
fraction of zero eigenvalues (denoted as the zero-one model), and covariance
matrices with spectra following a power-law distribution. We show that there
exists a structural phase transition. In particular, we demonstrate that, for
the zero-one model and the power-law model with sufficiently large power, SGD
tends to align more closely with values of the class mean that are projected
onto the "clean directions" (i.e., directions of smaller variance). This is
supported by both numerical simulations and analytical studies, which show the
exact asymptotic behavior of the loss in the high-dimensional limit.

Result: 混合光学-雷达方法和纯光学方法都达到了高精度，优于现有混合方法，且在光学数据稀疏的云层覆盖区域表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法在森林砍伐检测中表现出色，特别是在光学数据受限的情况下，混合方法具有显著优势。

Abstract: In this paper we develop a deforestation detection pipeline that incorporates
optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. A crucial component of the
pipeline is the construction of anomaly maps of the optical data, which is done
using the residual space of a discrete Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve (KL) expansion.
Anomalies are quantified using a concentration bound on the distribution of the
residual components for the nominal state of the forest. This bound does not
require prior knowledge on the distribution of the data. This is in contrast to
statistical parametric methods that assume knowledge of the data distribution,
an impractical assumption that is especially infeasible for high dimensional
data such as ours. Once the optical anomaly maps are computed they are combined
with SAR data, and the state of the forest is classified by using a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM). We test our approach with Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2
(Optical) data on a $92.19\,km \times 91.80\,km$ region in the Amazon forest.
The results show that both the hybrid optical-radar and optical only methods
achieve high accuracy that is superior to the recent state-of-the-art hybrid
method. Moreover, the hybrid method is significantly more robust in the case of
sparse optical data that are common in highly cloudy regions.

Conclusion: HD-BWDM为现代高维应用中的非参数聚类提供了理论可靠、计算高效的停止规则，是传统基于质心验证标准的鲁棒替代方案。

Abstract: Determining the appropriate number of clusters in unsupervised learning is a
central problem in statistics and data science. Traditional validity indices
such as Calinski-Harabasz, Silhouette, and Davies-Bouldin-depend on
centroid-based distances and therefore degrade in high-dimensional or
contaminated data. This paper proposes a new robust, nonparametric clustering
validation framework, the High-Dimensional Between-Within Distance Median
(HD-BWDM), which extends the recently introduced BWDM criterion to
high-dimensional spaces. HD-BWDM integrates random projection and principal
component analysis to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and applies trimmed
clustering and medoid-based distances to ensure robustness against outliers. We
derive theoretical results showing consistency and convergence under
Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings. Extensive simulations demonstrate that
HD-BWDM remains stable and interpretable under high-dimensional projections and
contamination, providing a robust alternative to traditional centroid-based
validation criteria. The proposed method provides a theoretically grounded,
computationally efficient stopping rule for nonparametric clustering in modern
high-dimensional applications.

Conclusion: Information Teacher为评估回归算法提供了一个有原则的替代方案，能够检测全局最优性并提供形式化性能保证。

Abstract: In Machine Learning (ML), a regression algorithm aims to minimize a loss
function based on data. An assessment method in this context seeks to quantify
the discrepancy between the optimal response for an input-output system and the
estimate produced by a learned predictive model (the student). Evaluating the
quality of a learned regressor remains challenging without access to the true
data-generating mechanism, as no data-driven assessment method can ensure the
achievability of global optimality. This work introduces the Information
Teacher, a novel data-driven framework for evaluating regression algorithms
with formal performance guarantees to assess global optimality. Our novel
approach builds on estimating the Shannon mutual information (MI) between the
input variables and the residuals and applies to a broad class of additive
noise models. Through numerical experiments, we confirm that the Information
Teacher is capable of detecting global optimality, which is aligned with the
condition of zero estimation error with respect to the -- inaccessible, in
practice -- true model, working as a surrogate measure of the ground truth
assessment loss and offering a principled alternative to conventional empirical
performance metrics.

Method: 提出稀疏行融合(SROF)正则化器，将SROF嵌入线性化ADMM框架，开发通信高效的RowFed算法，支持隐私保护的局部参与。

Result: 理论证明SROF具有oracle性质，能正确恢复变量级分组并具有渐近正态性；RowFed收敛到平稳解；在随机客户端参与下，迭代间隙以随参与概率提高的速率收缩。实证显示RowFed在异构场景下持续降低估计和预测误差，增强变量级聚类恢复。

Conclusion: 行级融合是规模化个性化联邦多变量学习的有效透明范式，弥合了逐项和矩阵级公式之间的差距。

Abstract: We study personalized federated learning for multivariate responses where
client models are heterogeneous yet share variable-level structure. Existing
entry-wise penalties ignore cross-response dependence, while matrix-wise fusion
over-couples clients. We propose a Sparse Row-wise Fusion (SROF) regularizer
that clusters row vectors across clients and induces within-row sparsity, and
we develop RowFed, a communication-efficient federated algorithm that embeds
SROF into a linearized ADMM framework with privacy-preserving partial
participation. Theoretically, we establish an oracle property for
SROF-achieving correct variable-level group recovery with asymptotic
normality-and prove convergence of RowFed to a stationary solution. Under
random client participation, the iterate gap contracts at a rate that improves
with participation probability. Empirically, simulations in heterogeneous
regimes show that RowFed consistently lowers estimation and prediction error
and strengthens variable-level cluster recovery over NonFed, FedAvg, and a
personalized matrix-fusion baseline. A real-data study further corroborates
these gains while preserving interpretability. Together, our results position
row-wise fusion as an effective and transparent paradigm for large-scale
personalized federated multivariate learning, bridging the gap between
entry-wise and matrix-wise formulations.

*Mátyás Schubert,Tom Claassen,Sara Magliacane*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: LOAD是一种结合局部方法计算效率和全局方法统计最优性的因果发现方法，能够在保持可扩展性的同时找到最优调整集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局因果发现方法虽然能找到最优调整集但计算成本高，局部方法虽然可扩展但只能找到统计次优的调整集，需要结合两者优势

Method: LOAD首先识别目标变量间的因果关系并测试可识别性，如果可识别则通过局部因果发现推断中介变量及其父节点来找到最优调整集，否则返回基于局部结构的有效父调整集

Result: 在合成和真实数据实验中，LOAD在可扩展性上优于全局方法，在效应估计准确性上优于局部方法

Conclusion: LOAD成功结合了局部方法的计算效率和全局方法的统计最优性，为因果效应估计提供了既高效又准确的方法

Abstract: Causal discovery methods can identify valid adjustment sets for causal effect
estimation for a pair of target variables, even when the underlying causal
graph is unknown. Global causal discovery methods focus on learning the whole
causal graph and therefore enable the recovery of optimal adjustment sets,
i.e., sets with the lowest asymptotic variance, but they quickly become
computationally prohibitive as the number of variables grows. Local causal
discovery methods offer a more scalable alternative by focusing on the local
neighborhood of the target variables, but are restricted to statistically
suboptimal adjustment sets. In this work, we propose Local Optimal Adjustments
Discovery (LOAD), a sound and complete causal discovery approach that combines
the computational efficiency of local methods with the statistical optimality
of global methods. First, LOAD identifies the causal relation between the
targets and tests if the causal effect is identifiable by using only local
information. If it is identifiable, it then finds the optimal adjustment set by
leveraging local causal discovery to infer the mediators and their parents.
Otherwise, it returns the locally valid parent adjustment sets based on the
learned local structure. In our experiments on synthetic and realistic data
LOAD outperforms global methods in scalability, while providing more accurate
effect estimation than local methods.

Conclusion: 该研究为具有不连续参数结构的PDE提供了一种通用的参数识别计算方法，特别适用于非平稳或异质系统

Abstract: Inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) with
discontinuous coefficients are fundamental challenges in modeling complex
spatiotemporal systems with heterogeneous structures and uncertain dynamics.
Traditional numerical and machine learning approaches often face limitations in
addressing these problems due to high dimensionality, inherent nonlinearity,
and discontinuous parameter spaces. In this work, we propose a novel
computational framework that synergistically integrates physics-informed deep
learning with Bayesian inference for accurate parameter identification in PDEs
with jump discontinuities in coefficients. The core innovation of our framework
lies in a dual-network architecture employing a gradient-adaptive weighting
strategy: a main network approximates PDE solutions while a sub network samples
its coefficients. To effectively identify mixture structures in parameter
spaces, we employ Markovian dynamics methods to capture hidden state
transitions of complex spatiotemporal systems. The framework has applications
in reconstruction of solutions and identification of parameter-varying regions.
Comprehensive numerical experiments on various PDEs with jump-varying
coefficients demonstrate the framework's exceptional adaptability, accuracy,
and robustness compared to existing methods. This study provides a
generalizable computational approach of parameter identification for PDEs with
discontinuous parameter structures, particularly in non-stationary or
heterogeneous systems.

Motivation: 现有方法需要昂贵的期望近似，且难以控制I类错误，需要开发更高效可靠的校准测试方法。

Method: 使用新的基于分数的概率核族，无需概率密度样本；采用条件拟合优度准则处理KCCSD测试的U统计量。

Result: 在各种合成设置中验证了测试的特性，证明其有效性。

Conclusion: KCCSD测试提供了一种无需期望近似且能控制I类错误的概率模型校准评估方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Kernel Calibration Conditional Stein Discrepancy test (KCCSD
test), a non-parametric, kernel-based test for assessing the calibration of
probabilistic models with well-defined scores. In contrast to previous methods,
our test avoids the need for possibly expensive expectation approximations
while providing control over its type-I error. We achieve these improvements by
using a new family of kernels for score-based probabilities that can be
estimated without probability density samples, and by using a conditional
goodness-of-fit criterion for the KCCSD test's U-statistic. We demonstrate the
properties of our test on various synthetic settings.

Motivation: 传统最优实验设计方法依赖于概率密度，导致不变性受限。需要一种更灵活、几何化的方法来优化实验设计。

Method: 基于最优传输理论提出互输运依赖(MTD)作为统计依赖度量，通过选择适当的几何结构来定制下游估计问题。

Result: 该框架能够产生高质量的设计，为传统信息论技术提供了灵活的替代方案。

Conclusion: MTD框架在最优实验设计中表现出色，具有更好的几何适应性和灵活性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel geometric framework for optimal experimental design
(OED). Traditional OED approaches, such as those based on mutual information,
rely explicitly on probability densities, leading to restrictive invariance
properties. To address these limitations, we propose the mutual transport
dependence (MTD), a measure of statistical dependence grounded in optimal
transport theory which provides a geometric objective for optimizing designs.
Unlike conventional approaches, the MTD can be tailored to specific downstream
estimation problems by choosing appropriate geometries on the underlying
spaces. We demonstrate that our framework produces high-quality designs while
offering a flexible alternative to standard information-theoretic techniques.

Conclusion: 指令调优的大语言模型为大规模真实世界设备识别提供了可扩展和可解释的基础，能够有效应对稀疏性和长尾供应商分布等挑战。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

TL;DR: 提出STDW方法，通过动态加权机制增强渐进域适应的鲁棒性，平衡源域和目标域的损失贡献，在多个数据集上优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统渐进域适应方法存在知识迁移效率低或中间数据不完整的问题，需要更平滑的知识迁移机制。

Method: 引入动态加权机制，使用时间变化超参数ϱ控制域特定学习强度，结合自训练生成伪标签，优化加权目标函数进行迭代更新。

Conclusion: STDW为鲁棒渐进域适应提供了理论洞见和实用框架，在动态现实场景中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

Motivation: 基于假设：神经网络在深度特征的高频分量中编码任务相关语义信息，在低频分量中存储领域特定偏差，希望通过分离高频分量来提升模型泛化性。

Method: 从原始特征中减去低通滤波输出，分离出可泛化的表示，同时保持架构完整性。

Result: 在视觉、文本、3D和音频等多个领域的实验结果显示，无论模型架构和数据模态如何，都能获得一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了特征稀疏化并有效分离高频分量，为核心假设提供了实证验证，证明了深度特征中频率分量分离对提升泛化能力的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass
filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.
Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode
task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing
domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By
subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach
isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural
integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,
3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of
model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces
feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,
providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法如LFS-GAN在每次训练迭代中引入大量新权重，长期来看参数负担显著。需要一种更高效的参数适应方法来解决持续少样本学习问题。

Method: 提出CoLoR-GAN框架，利用低秩张量高效适应目标任务。引入LLoRA（LoRA in LoRA）技术进一步优化卷积层适配器大小，并提供超参数选择的实证研究。

Conclusion: CoLoR-GAN通过低秩适应技术成功解决了GAN中的持续少样本学习问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了参数需求。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合对抗训练的统一框架，同时实现鲁棒分类和高质量生成建模，解决了传统联合能量模型训练不稳定和样本质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合方法如JEM将分类器解释为能量模型，但受限于SGLD训练的不稳定性和样本质量差。需要一种能同时实现鲁棒分类和高质量生成的统一框架。

Method: 采用对抗训练原则：1) 用稳定的AT方法替代SGLD，通过BCE损失区分真实数据和PGD生成的对比样本来优化能量函数；2) 协同对抗训练增强分类鲁棒性；3) 两阶段训练解决批归一化与EBM训练的不兼容性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著提升对抗鲁棒性，同时保持竞争力的生成性能。在ImageNet上生成质量超越BigGAN，接近扩散模型，是首个在复杂高分辨率数据集上实现高质量生成的MCMC-based EBM方法。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了限制JEM扩展的关键稳定性问题，证明对抗训练可作为统一框架的有效基础，能够生成并鲁棒分类视觉数据。

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

TL;DR: K-frames提出了一种场景驱动的关键帧选择新范式，通过预测语义连贯的查询相关片段来保持时间连续性，支持任意数量的关键帧选择以满足不同用户预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中受到上下文窗口和计算成本的限制，均匀帧采样会导致大量信息丢失，而现有关键帧选择方法通常产生稀疏且时间不连续的帧，忽略了场景连续性。

Method: 首先构建了包含20万视频高光片段的PeakClips数据集，然后采用三阶段渐进式课程学习：两个监督微调阶段用于时间定位和关键片段感知，接着是强化学习阶段直接优化场景驱动预测策略。

Result: 在主要长视频理解基准测试上的广泛实验表明，K-frames提供了有效、可解释且即插即用的多尺度关键帧选择解决方案。

Conclusion: K-frames通过场景驱动的关键帧选择方法，解决了长视频理解中的信息丢失和场景连续性缺失问题，为多尺度关键帧选择提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

Motivation: 现有的标签分布学习方法仅针对单视图和带标签数据，而多视图且包含未标记数据的标签分布学习问题尚未被考虑。

Method: 首先计算每个视图的k-最近邻，然后通过整合其他视图的最近邻信息来补充每个样本的最近邻集合，最后基于补充后的最近邻集合构建基于图学习的多视图半监督标签分布学习模型。

Result: 数值研究表明，MVSS-LDL在分类性能上明显优于现有的单视图标签分布学习方法。

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试多视图标签分布学习，通过考虑局部最近邻结构的互补性，不同视图可以相互提供局部结构信息来补充彼此。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

Motivation: 现有模型合并方法严重依赖缩放超参数λ，但缺乏无需数据的λ设置原则方法，导致研究者不得不使用评估数据进行调优，这在实践中不可行

Method: Weight Weaving技术，使用用户定义的池化函数（如平均、随机选择或现有模型合并方法）在λ值搜索空间中池化模型权重

Conclusion: Weight Weaving具有高度模块化，对搜索空间约束最小，与现有模型合并方法正交，消除了评估数据需求

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

Motivation: 临床笔记通常伴随ICD诊断编码序列，正确分配和排序这些编码对医疗诊断和报销至关重要。现有方法将问题视为分类任务，忽略了编码顺序的重要性。

Method: 从检索系统视角重新定义问题，将其构建为分类和排序任务，以同时考虑编码分配和排序。

Result: 在识别高优先级编码方面表现优异：主要诊断编码排序准确率达47%（相比现有方法的20%）；分类指标方面，微平均和宏平均F1分数分别为0.6065和0.2904，超过之前最佳模型的0.597和0.2660。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在ICD编码排序和分类方面均优于现有方法，证明了考虑编码顺序的重要性。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的数据保真度损失函数——分布一致性损失，用于解决逆问题中传统点对点匹配方法容易过拟合噪声的问题，通过分布层面的校准来提升信号恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据保真度损失函数（如均方误差）追求与噪声测量值的点对点匹配，容易导致对噪声的过拟合。需要一种能够从统计分布层面评估数据一致性的方法。

Method: 引入分布一致性损失，通过模型为基础的概率分数对每个测量值进行分布层面的校准，替代传统的点对点匹配方法。该方法与现代正则化器兼容，优化方式与传统损失相同。

Result: 在图像去噪中，使用DC损失替代MSE损失无需提前停止训练即可获得更高的PSNR；在医学图像重建中，DC损失减少了高度迭代重建中的伪影，并增强了手工正则化的效果。

Conclusion: DC损失为逆问题提供了一种统计基础扎实、性能提升明显的替代传统保真度损失的方法，特别适用于测量噪声分布已知且数据集包含大量独立噪声值的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

*Xun Wu,Shaohan Huang,Wenhui Wang,Ting Song,Li Dong,Yan Xia,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BitNet Distillation (BitDistill) 是一个轻量级流程，可将现成的全精度大语言模型微调为1.58位精度（三元权重{-1, 0, 1}），在特定下游任务上实现强大性能，同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型在特定任务上部署时的高计算成本和内存需求问题，作者希望开发一种方法，能够将全精度模型高效地转换为极低精度模型，同时保持任务特定性能。

Method: BitDistill结合了三个关键技术：BitNet引入的SubLN模块、基于MiniLM的多头注意力蒸馏，以及作为关键预热步骤的持续预训练，以缓解全精度和1.58位模型在特定任务上的性能差距。

Result: 实验结果显示，BitDistill在不同模型规模下都能达到与全精度对应模型相当的性能，同时实现了高达10倍的内存节省和2.65倍的CPU推理加速。

Conclusion: BitDistill提供了一种有效的方法，能够在保持性能的同时大幅降低大语言模型在特定任务部署时的计算和内存需求，为资源受限环境下的模型部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出REAP方法，证明在生成任务中专家剪枝优于专家合并，通过考虑路由器门值和专家激活范数实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏激活的专家混合模型参数数量庞大，内存开销显著，需要研究专家压缩方法。

Method: 提出Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP)剪枝标准，结合路由器门值和专家激活范数来选择要剪枝的专家。

Result: 在20B到1T参数的SMoE模型上，REAP在生成基准测试中始终优于合并和其他剪枝方法，特别是在50%压缩率下。在代码生成和工具调用任务中，即使剪枝50%专家也能实现近乎无损的压缩。

Conclusion: 专家剪枝是生成任务的更优策略，REAP方法通过避免功能子空间崩溃实现了高效的专家压缩。

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient
pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create
significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression.
Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative
benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for
generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by
causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's
independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we
propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning
criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms.
Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP
consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative
benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves
near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with
Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到深度神经网络的反向传播算法与动态系统最优性条件（通过动态规划表达）之间存在显著的算法相似性，这为将最优控制理论应用于神经网络优化提供了理论基础。

Method: 通过将反向传播视为具有变分结构的过程，求解贝尔曼方程的一阶近似动态规划，探索高阶展开，开发出OCNOpt优化器，支持层间反馈策略、博弈论应用和连续时间模型的高阶训练。

Result: 大量实验表明，OCNOpt在保持可控计算复杂度的同时，在鲁棒性和效率方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OCNOpt为基于动力系统和最优控制理论的原则性算法设计开辟了新途径，实现了更鲁棒高效的神经网络优化。

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich
algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,
game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time
models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt
improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining
manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled
algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.

Method: 提出条件Clifford-可操纵核，用输入特征场的等变表示增强核，通过隐式参数化高效求解等变约束。

Result: 在流体动力学和相对论电动力学等多个PDE预测任务中，该方法持续优于基线方法，证明了改进的表达能力。

Conclusion: 条件Clifford-可操纵核有效解决了CSCNNs核基不完备的问题，显著提升了模型在物理系统建模中的性能。

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: DR-RPO成功将策略优化扩展到鲁棒RL，为分布偏移下的在线学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在几何感知优化算法基础上添加噪声自适应分层学习率的方法，通过动态估计梯度方差来为同一组内的不同层分配时变学习率，显著加速了深度神经网络训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的几何感知优化算法（如Muon）虽然通过为不同层选择适当范数来利用DNN的底层几何结构，但在同一范数组内的各层之间施加固定的学习率。然而，即使在同一组内，各层的局部曲率也存在异质性，并且在整个训练过程中动态变化，这可能导致训练效率低下。

Method: 在几何感知优化算法之上引入噪声自适应分层学习率方案，动态估计由所选线性最小化oracle诱导的对偶范数中的梯度方差，并使用它为每个组内的不同层分配时变、噪声自适应的分层学习率。

Result: 理论分析表明该算法实现了尖锐的收敛率。在LLaMA和GPT等transformer架构上的实证结果表明，该方法比最先进的优化器实现了更快的收敛。

Conclusion: 提出的噪声自适应分层学习率方案能够有效解决几何感知优化中同一组内各层学习率固定的问题，通过动态调整学习率显著加速了深度神经网络的训练过程。

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

TL;DR: 提出D-GCN架构，通过分离节点自身传输概率与邻居干扰效应，解决多跳无线网络中p-persistent CSMA协议吞吐量预测问题，显著优于标准GCN和传统分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单干扰域模型在稀疏拓扑中低估吞吐量48-62%，精确马尔可夫链分析计算复杂度指数增长，标准GNN因对称归一化混淆直接干扰与高阶级联效应而表现不佳。

Method: 设计解耦图卷积网络(D-GCN)，用可学习注意力替代均值聚合，显式分离节点自身传输概率与邻居干扰效应，捕获复杂多跳干扰模式。

Result: D-GCN达到3.3%归一化平均绝对误差，优于强基线方法，在精确分析方法不可行时仍可计算，基于梯度的网络优化达到理论最优值的1%以内。

Conclusion: D-GCN通过结构化解耦设计有效解决无线网络吞吐量预测问题，为大规模网络分析提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but
predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks
remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared
interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse
topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in
computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These
computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like
GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet
off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean
absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization
conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects
that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional
Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a
node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN
replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable,
per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference
patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains
tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible,
and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of
theoretical optima.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型归因方法需要模型梯度或重新训练，限制了在专有或大规模设置中的适用性，因此需要一种完全基于数据的非参数方法。

Method: 基于最优得分函数的解析形式，通过图像块级相似性测量生成图像与训练图像之间的影响，支持多尺度表示，并通过基于卷积的加速实现计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算高效且可解释的数据归因框架，能够揭示训练数据与输出之间的内在关系，不依赖于特定模型。

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型存在二次复杂度和长序列依赖处理困难的问题，而现有状态空间模型（如S6）的选择性机制仅依赖当前输入，缺乏对序列历史的有效利用。

Method: 提出COFFEE模型，通过状态反馈机制从内部状态计算选择性，内部状态作为序列历史的紧凑表示；采用高效参数化方法消除S6中的冗余。

Result: 在induction head任务中，COFFEE以少两个数量级的参数和训练序列达到接近完美的准确率；在MNIST上仅用3585参数达到97%准确率，大幅优于S6。

Conclusion: 状态反馈是构建可扩展高效序列模型的关键机制，COFFEE展示了在参数效率和性能方面的显著优势。

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most
foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties
in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has
shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the
S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art
results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE
(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state
feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for
parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends
on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves
as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the
model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its
ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we
employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in
S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head
task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer
parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely
outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only
3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key
mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

Conclusion: 尽管测量成本存在，但减少的不确定性可以证明提高样本效率并增加最优策略的价值。

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

Conclusion: 该基准为CRL方法提供了全面的评估环境，通过评估代表性CRL方法提供了实证见解，帮助研究者和实践者选择或扩展适当的CRL框架来解决现实问题。

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

Conclusion: 该框架为AD理论提供了微分几何视角，为开发结构保持的微分方法提供了理论基础，在深度学习和科学计算中具有应用前景。

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

Motivation: 现有药物-靶点亲和力预测方法主要关注预测值的准确性，但忽略了交互效应的方向性。正确捕捉交互方向对于药物分配决策至关重要。

Method: 引入IC-index评估指标，分析预测器对交互方向的捕捉能力。通过理论证明和实证评估，验证IC-index在评估交互方向预测性能方面的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，IC-index能够有效区分不同预测方法在交互方向预测上的性能差异，为现有预测性能评估提供了重要补充。

Conclusion: IC-index是一个有价值的评估工具，能够评估预测方法对交互方向的捕捉能力，有助于改进药物-靶点亲和力预测模型的决策支持能力。

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了稀疏maxout网络的表达能力，建立了网络函数与虚拟多面体之间的对偶关系，推导了深度层次结构，证明了在固定入度约束下宽度无法弥补深度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏maxout网络（模拟卷积或图神经网络）的表达能力，探索网络深度与宽度在表达能力上的权衡关系。

Method: 建立稀疏maxout网络函数与虚拟多面体类之间的对偶关系，利用多面体几何分析网络表达能力，推导维度紧界作为核心分析工具。

Result: 构造了深度层次结构序列，证明足够深的稀疏maxout网络具有通用性，但在固定入度约束下，如果深度不足，仅靠增加宽度无法补偿表达能力的缺失。

Conclusion: 稀疏maxout网络的表达能力受深度和入度约束的共同影响，深度在表达能力中起着不可替代的关键作用。

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes
a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly
multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于先验预测矩匹配的严格方法来确定概率张量模型中的秩可识别性，将矩匹配条件转化为对数线性方程组，并证明秩可识别性与该系统的可解性等价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 张量分解中潜在维度（秩）的选择通常依赖启发式方法，缺乏严格的理论基础，需要一种严谨的方法来确定秩的可识别性。

Method: 将矩匹配条件转化为关于边际矩、先验超参数和秩的对数线性方程组，建立秩可识别性与系统可解性的等价关系，并应用于四种基础张量模型。

Result: 证明PARAFAC/CP、张量链和张量环模型的秩是可识别的，而Tucker模型的秩由于对称拓扑结构导致系统欠定而不可识别。对于可识别模型，推导了基于观测数据矩的显式闭式秩估计器。

Conclusion: 该方法为张量分解中的秩选择提供了理论基础，成功识别了不同张量模型的秩可识别性，并开发了实用的秩估计器。

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机对照试验依赖手工假设和昂贵分析，限制了因果效应估计的规模，可能遗漏重要但未被假设的效应。

Method: 使用预训练基础模型将非结构化数据转化为有意义的表示，通过稀疏自编码器解释，并采用递归分层策略解决多重检验和效应纠缠问题。

Result: 在半合成实验中验证了算法的鲁棒性，并在实验生态学背景下首次成功实现了真实世界科学试验中的无监督因果效应识别。

Conclusion: Neural Effect Search能够直接从数据中发现未知的因果效应，为大规模因果发现提供了新途径。

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究双边市场中的定价和匹配算法，设计了一种基于在线学习的新颖定价策略，在平台利润最大化和队列长度控制之间取得了近乎最优的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在双边市场中，价格敏感的客户和服务商分别加入队列，平台需要设计定价和匹配算法来最大化利润，同时控制队列长度。由于实践中需求和供给曲线可能未知，需要开发不依赖这些信息的在线学习策略。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的在线学习定价策略，包含动态组件优化遗憾与队列长度的权衡，以及概率组件解决快速学习所需样本与队列长度控制之间的张力。

Result: 证明了在γ∈(0,1/6]范围内，实现了Õ(T^{1-γ})遗憾、Õ(T^{γ/2})平均队列长度和Õ(T^{γ})最大队列长度的性能权衡，显著优于现有结果，且这种权衡在允许的γ范围内是最优的。

Conclusion: 所提出的策略在不依赖需求和供给曲线知识的情况下，实现了近乎最优的性能权衡，解决了双边市场中定价和匹配的关键挑战。

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

*Alexandru Meterez,Depen Morwani,Jingfeng Wu,Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Cengiz Pehlevan,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Seesaw框架，通过在学习率衰减时同时增加批量大小来加速大语言模型预训练，在保持损失动态的同时减少串行步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批量大小增加是加速大语言模型预训练的有前景策略，但对于Adam等自适应优化器的最优策略尚不明确，通常需要启发式调参。

Method: 开发了Seesaw框架：当标准调度器将学习率减半时，Seesaw将学习率乘以1/√2并加倍批量大小，保持损失动态同时减少串行步骤。

Result: 在150M/300M/600M参数模型上，Seesaw在相同FLOPs下匹配余弦衰减性能，同时减少约36%的墙上时间，接近理论极限。

Conclusion: Seesaw提供了一种原则性的批量大小调度方法，在保持训练质量的同时显著加速大语言模型预训练。

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

Result: 证明了两层神经网络足以逼近一维反应-扩散方程，三层神经网络足以逼近二维反应-扩散方程，该理论框架可进一步扩展到椭圆和抛物型方程。

Conclusion: 这项工作突显了神经网络在逼近反应-扩散方程及相关偏微分方程解方面的表达能力，为基于神经网络的微分方程求解器提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations
used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes.
With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,
providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential
equation solvers.

Existing methods assume mutually independent latent confounders or cannot

  We propose a novel algorithm that identifies causal DAGs in LvLiNGAM,
allowing causal structures among latent variables, among observed variables,
and between the two. The proposed method leverages higher-order cumulants of
observed data to identify the causal structure. Extensive simulations and
experiments with real-world data demonstrate the validity and practical utility
of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution
remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for
the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work
investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks
using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a
testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed
at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)
algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete
bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,
these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent
space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization
capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic
interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust
OOD generalization abilities.

Conclusion: 梯度上升是一种有效的机器遗忘方法，能在移除特定数据的同时保持模型在保留数据上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

Conclusion: TENDE提供了一种灵活、可扩展的转移熵估计方法，突破了现有方法的局限性，在多个应用领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IRT方法使用logistic链接函数会破坏TVD-MI数据的可加性结构，引入不必要的曲率，影响评估准确性。

Method: 从Gini熵最大化推导出剪裁线性模型，采用盒约束最小二乘公式处理边界饱和问题，使用恒等链接函数保持几何结构。

Result: 在33%覆盖率下，保持代理排名（Spearman ρ=0.972）的同时获得RMSE 0.117，比密集评估减少三倍计算量。不同评委间排名一致性高（ρ=0.872）。

Conclusion: TVD-MI的几何结构最适合使用恒等映射进行高效LLM评估，该方法也适用于其他有界响应领域。

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity
mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response
domains.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

Conclusion: 对SGCRL探索机制的深入理解使其能够适应安全感知探索，为无监督强化学习的理论基础提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

TL;DR: 提出ProtGram-DirectGCN框架，通过层次化n-gram图和定向图卷积网络进行蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用预测，在有限训练数据下仍保持强大性能。

Result: DirectGCN在标准节点分类基准上表现优异，特别擅长处理复杂定向图和密集异质结构。ProtGram-DirectGCN框架在PPI预测中展现出强大预测能力。

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

Abstract: In the evolving domains of Machine Learning and Data Analytics, existing
dataset characterization methods such as statistical, structural, and
model-based analyses often fail to deliver the deep understanding and insights
essential for innovation and explainability. This work surveys the current
state-of-the-art conventional data analytic techniques and examines their

provide a more robust alternative to traditional statistical, structural, and
model-based dataset characterization techniques. Through examples, we
illustrate how tensor methods unveil nuanced data characteristics, offering
enhanced interpretability and actionable intelligence. We advocate for the
adoption of tensor-based characterization, promising a leap forward in
understanding complex datasets and paving the way for intelligent, explainable

*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种可逆模型融合(RMM)方法，通过构建紧凑基向量空间来恢复原始任务特定模型，而不是将所有适配器压缩到单一权重中，解决了低秩压缩模型融合时的性能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统融合方法应用于低秩权重（如LoRA或SVD压缩）时会导致严重的性能下降，需要一种新的融合策略来保持压缩模型的性能。

Method: 构建紧凑基向量空间，通过线性组合恢复原始任务特定模型，提供闭式解来选择最优权重基和任务特定系数。

Result: 在多样化数据集和模型规模上的实验表明，RMM始终优于现有融合方法，显著保持了低秩压缩模型的性能。

Conclusion: 将融合重新定义为生成可重构模型空间而非单一合并模型，允许在需要时恢复到各个特定任务模型，认识到没有合并模型能始终优于专门针对其任务的模型。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

TL;DR: MAFA是一个生产部署的多智能体标注框架，通过可配置的多智能体协作解决金融服务中的大规模标注积压问题，在JP Morgan Chase成功消除100万条话语积压，节省5000多小时人工标注时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融服务中数百万客户话语需要准确分类的标注积压挑战，传统方法效率低下且成本高昂。

Method: 结合专门化智能体、结构化推理和基于法官的共识机制，支持通过配置而非代码修改来定义自定义标注类型，实现动态任务适应。

Result: 平均86%与人工标注一致率，消除100万条话语积压，节省5000多小时人工标注，在内部意图分类数据集上Top-1准确率提升13.8%，Top-5准确率提升15.1%，F1分数提升16.9%。

Conclusion: MAFA弥合了理论多智能体系统与实际企业部署之间的差距，为面临类似标注挑战的组织提供了蓝图。

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

Motivation: 扩散模型擅长生成，但其潜在空间没有明确组织以实现可解释控制。需要一种方法来对齐潜在几何与系统动力学。

Method: 应用对比学习在扩散嵌入中，组织潜在空间使遍历方向反映底层动力学因素，支持非线性轨迹遍历。

Result: 在流体动力学、神经钙成像、治疗性神经刺激和面部表情等基准测试中，ConDA产生了比线性遍历和基于条件的基线方法更具可解释性和可控性的潜在表示。

Conclusion: 扩散潜在编码包含与动力学相关的结构，但利用这种结构需要潜在组织并沿着潜在流形进行遍历。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护数据隐私，但面临参与困境问题——参与实体不愿贡献资源却想免费搭便车，这限制了联邦学习的实际适应性。

Method: 应用经济学和博弈论概念，结合区块链和深度强化学习等技术解决方案，建立了一个全面的激励机制分类法，涵盖集中式和去中心化架构。

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

TL;DR: 对分子核进行首次全面谱分析，发现更丰富的谱特征并不总是提高准确性，甚至在某些表示中与性能呈负相关。领先特征值（仅2%）就能恢复几乎所有性能，挑战了"更丰富谱带来更好泛化"的常见启发式观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解核的谱特性为泛化和表示质量提供了原则性视角。虽然深度模型在分子性质预测中达到最先进精度，但核方法因其在低数据环境下的鲁棒性和透明理论基础仍被广泛使用。分子核的系统谱分析研究稀缺。

Method: 在QM9数据集上对核岭回归进行综合谱分析，涵盖分子指纹、预训练transformer、全局和局部3D表示，分析七个分子性质。使用四种不同谱度量，实施截断核来探究谱与预测性能的关系。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，更丰富的谱特征（通过四种不同谱度量测量）并不一致提高准确性。Pearson相关性测试显示，对于transformer和局部3D表示，谱丰富度甚至与性能呈负相关。在许多核中，仅保留前2%特征值就能恢复几乎所有性能。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了"更丰富谱产生更好泛化"的常见启发式观点，突出了表示、核特征和预测性能之间的微妙关系。这些发现为在数据受限的科学和现实任务中评估核和自监督学习方法提供了信息。

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文重新审视了平坦最小值与对抗鲁棒性的关系，发现平坦性仅能保证局部鲁棒性而非全局鲁棒性，并揭示了对抗样本往往位于模型自信但错误的平坦区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期以来假设平坦最小值能提供更好的对抗鲁棒性，但这种关系缺乏严谨的形式化分析，需要系统研究平坦性与鲁棒性的确切联系。

Method: 首先推导了倒数第二层相对平坦度的闭式表达式，然后利用该表达式约束输入空间中损失函数的变化，从而形式化分析整个网络的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 理论分析和实证验证表明，平坦性只能保证局部鲁棒性，要维持全局鲁棒性，损失函数需要在数据流形外急剧弯曲。对抗样本通常位于模型自信但错误的大平坦区域。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了对平坦性的简化理解，提供了对其在鲁棒性中作用的细致理解，表明平坦性与模型置信度相关，但不足以保证全局对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified
views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in
robustness.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 在水槽数据集上的综合实验表明，PhysAttnNet显著优于主流模型，跨场景泛化测试验证了模型对未知环境的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: PhysAttnNet作为一个框架，在海洋工程复杂系统的预测模型开发中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

Conclusion: CAST提供了与现有方法互补的见解，通过直接矩阵估计和频谱分析揭示了Transformer层的功能特性，有助于更好地理解语言模型的内部工作机制。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

TL;DR: CAREBench是一个早期事件预测基准，评估多模态输入下的预测准确性和时间稳定性，发现现有方法在准确性和稳定性之间难以平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有早期事件预测系统忽略风险评分的时间稳定性，且主要基于表格数据评估，缺乏对多模态输入和风险轨迹行为的测试。

Method: 提出CAREBench基准，使用多模态输入（表格EHR、ECG波形、临床文本），引入基于局部Lipschitz常数的稳定性指标来量化短期风险变异性。

Result: 现有方法（特别是LLMs）在准确性和稳定性之间难以平衡，在高精度操作点召回率表现较差。

Conclusion: 需要开发能产生证据对齐、稳定轨迹的模型，以在持续监测环境中获得临床医生的信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

### [190] [Enhancing Time-Series Anomaly Detection by Integrating Spectral-Residual Bottom-Up Attention with Reservoir Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14287)
*Hayato Nihei,Sou Nobukawa,Yusuke Sakemi,Kazuyuki Aihara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合谱残差方法和储层计算的SR-RC模型，用于时间序列异常检测，在保持学习效率的同时提高了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 储层计算在边缘AI应用中具有优势，但单独使用时可能需要过大的储层来达到足够的异常检测性能，而注意力机制虽然能提高精度但可能损害学习效率。

Method: 将谱残差方法（一种无需学习的自底向上注意力机制）与储层计算相结合，提出SR-RC模型。

Result: SR-RC在基准任务和真实世界时间序列数据集上优于传统储层计算和基于谱残差方法提取值的逻辑回归模型。

Conclusion: SR-RC为将储层计算部署为时间序列异常检测的边缘AI提供了实用方向，因为谱残差方法与储层计算都适合硬件实现。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

*Nam Le,Leo Yu Zhang,Kewen Liao,Shirui Pan,Wei Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TED++是一个子流形感知框架，通过构建每个类隐藏特征流形的管状邻域并应用局部自适应排序来检测逃避现有防御的隐蔽后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络在关键应用中广泛使用，隐蔽的后门攻击（中毒训练输入触发恶意行为但看起来良性）构成严重安全风险。现有防御在面对利用细微距离异常或干净样本稀缺的攻击时存在漏洞。

Method: TED++为每个类的隐藏特征流形构建管状邻域，从少量干净激活中估计局部"厚度"，然后应用局部自适应排序检测漂移出允许管的激活。通过聚合所有层的LAR调整排名，捕获输入在演化类子流形上的忠实度。

Result: 在基准数据集和任务上的广泛实验表明，TED++在自适应攻击和有限数据场景下都实现了最先进的检测性能。即使每类只有5个保留样本，TED++仍能实现近乎完美的检测，AUROC比次优方法提升高达14%。

Conclusion: TED++通过子流形感知和管约束行为分析，有效检测逃避现有防御的隐蔽后门攻击，在有限数据场景下表现优异。

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/namle-w/TEDpp.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-ERM：一种结合LLM引导搜索和ERM验证的程序学习框架，在样本效率和计算可行性上优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决程序学习中样本效率和计算可行性的平衡问题——传统枚举方法计算成本高，梯度方法在某些短程序家族上需要指数级样本

Method: 提出LLM-ERM框架：使用预训练LLM生成k个候选程序，在保留数据上编译验证并选择最佳假设，无需梯度或反馈

Result: LLM-ERM仅需200样本即可解决奇偶校验、模式匹配、素数测试等任务，而SGD训练的transformer即使有10万样本也会过拟合

Conclusion: 语言引导的程序合成在保持计算可行性的同时恢复了有限类ERM的统计效率，为学习梯度方法无法处理的简洁假设提供了实用路径

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

*Shruti Sarika Chakraborty,Peter Minary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DARTS-GT方法，通过非对称注意力机制和解耦结构编码与特征表示，结合可微架构搜索实现深度异构的图Transformer，同时建立了首个图Transformer的定量可解释性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图Transformer存在设计僵化、缺乏量化可解释性的问题，固定GNN类型无法实现深度特定组件选择，复杂架构难以区分性能提升是来自有意义的模式还是虚假相关性。

Method: 重新设计图Transformer注意力机制，采用非对称结构：查询来自节点特征，键和值来自GNN变换。使用可微架构搜索(DARTS)为每层选择最优GNN算子，实现注意力内部的深度异构。开发因果消融的定量可解释性框架，包含头部偏差、专业化和聚焦度等指标。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，DARTS-GT在四个数据集上达到最先进水平，在其他数据集上保持竞争力。发现的架构揭示了数据集特定模式。可解释性分析显示视觉注意力显著性与因果重要性并不总是相关。

Conclusion: DARTS-GT发现的异构架构比基线模型产生更可解释的模型，证明图Transformer无需在性能和可解释性之间做出选择。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出Stop-RAG方法，通过基于价值的控制器自适应决定何时停止检索，解决迭代RAG中固定迭代次数或置信度代理方法效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迭代RAG在回答复杂多跳问题时，每次额外循环都会增加延迟、成本和引入干扰证据的风险，需要高效的停止策略。现有方法要么使用预定迭代次数，要么依赖不能很好反映是否需要更多检索的置信度代理。

Method: 将迭代RAG建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，引入基于价值的控制器Stop-RAG，使用完整轨迹的全宽度前向视图Q(λ)目标进行训练，兼容黑盒API和现有流水线。

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，Stop-RAG持续优于固定迭代基线和基于提示的LLM停止方法。

Conclusion: 自适应停止是当前代理系统中缺失的关键组件，基于价值的控制可以提高RAG系统的准确性。

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM系统在日常AI应用中的广泛使用，提示优化阶段的安全性尚未得到充分研究，需要评估投毒风险并开发防护措施。

Method: 使用HarmBench评估系统脆弱性，设计无需访问奖励模型的假奖励攻击，并提出轻量级高亮防御方法。

Result: 反馈攻击使攻击成功率提升高达ΔASR=0.48，假奖励攻击将ΔASR从0.23降低到0.07，且不影响系统效用。

Conclusion: 提示优化管道应被视为一级攻击面，需要加强对反馈通道和优化框架的安全防护。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SHaRe-SSM（脉冲谐波共振放电状态空间模型），一种用于超长序列建模的二阶脉冲状态空间模型，相比Transformer和一阶SSM性能更好，同时避免了乘法运算，能耗显著降低。


<details>

Motivation: 结合脉冲神经网络（SNN）的能效优势和状态空间模型（SSM）在长序列建模中的能力，开发适合资源受限应用的高效模型。

Method: 设计二阶脉冲SSM，利用并行扫描实现动态系统的稳定高效实现，首次提出基于核的脉冲回归器用于超长序列。

Result: 在18k序列上比二阶ANN-based SSM能耗降低73倍，在50k序列上仍保持优越性能，同时进行了异质性、耗散和守恒的系统分析。

Conclusion: SHaRe-SSM在保持性能的同时显著提高了能效，特别适合长序列建模和资源受限应用。

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题不仅发生在表示学习阶段，在决策层也显著存在。研究发现即使经过充分预训练和平衡优化，模型仍会系统性地偏向某些模态（如音频），这种偏见源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习整合不同模态信息以提升模型性能，但常面临模态不平衡问题，即主导模态在联合优化过程中压制较弱模态。本文旨在揭示这种不平衡不仅存在于表示学习阶段，在决策层也显著存在。

Method: 在音频-视觉数据集（CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds）上进行实验，分析经过预训练和平衡优化后模型的决策行为，探究特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异。

Result: 实验表明，即使经过充分预训练和平衡优化，模型仍会系统性地偏向某些模态（如音频）。进一步分析显示这种偏见源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，而非仅由优化动态引起。

Conclusion: 在融合阶段聚合未校准的模态输出会导致决策层权重偏斜，阻碍较弱模态有效贡献。建议未来多模态系统应更多关注在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制，根据各模态能力实现相对平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

Motivation: MoE技术虽然能有效扩展模型规模，但其巨大的内存开销使得模型压缩成为重要研究方向。

Method: 从专家输出合并的角度重新解释专家合并，将其视为在正向计算中插入额外矩阵，并基于此提出使用数学优化构建压缩矩阵的MergeMoE方法。

Result: 在多个MoE模型上的评估显示，MergeMoE在相同压缩比下始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 从专家输出合并的角度理解专家合并，并通过数学优化方法构建压缩矩阵，能够有效压缩MoE模型并保持性能。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

Motivation: 挑战神经网络剪枝中避免完全重训练的常规做法，研究剪枝后权重重构的关键设计选择，探索更高效的性能恢复方法。

Method: 在GPT架构上进行广泛计算研究，比较不同重构粒度（单矩阵、组件级、块级）与完全重训练的效果，使用简单高效的剪枝标准如Wanda。

Result: 发现组件级重构（分别重构attention和MLP）是帕累托最优方案，不仅资源效率最高，而且性能优于完全重训练，同时内存需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: 重构步骤的重要性超过复杂剪枝方法，挑战了"不惜一切代价避免重训练"的叙事，为LLM剪枝后性能恢复提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

Motivation: 当前方法难以准确再现地质结构特别是河流沉积物的连续性，需要更有效的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络（GAN）进行生成建模，通过基于过程模型生成训练数据，并利用沉积时间等地质属性来验证模型性能。

Result: GAN能够稳定训练，生成的样本能够再现沉积物的非平稳性和细节，没有出现模式崩溃或纯记忆训练数据的问题。

Conclusion: GAN在地质建模中比预期更稳健，特别是在针对特定地质结构的训练数据集上，利用地质原理如叠加律具有很大潜力。

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained
environments.

TL;DR: MECo是一个分子优化框架，通过将编辑意图转化为可执行代码来弥合推理与执行之间的差距，在保持结构相似性的同时显著提高了编辑准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在分子优化中难以忠实执行编辑意图的问题，特别是在处理非直观表示（如SMILES）时，需要更精确的结构推理和领域知识。

Method: 采用级联框架：首先生成人类可理解的编辑意图，然后将这些意图通过代码生成转化为可执行的结构编辑操作。

Result: 在化学反应和靶向化合物对的真实编辑上达到98%以上的准确率，在物理化学性质和靶标活性优化基准测试中，一致性提高38-86个百分点至90%以上，成功率高于基于SMILES的基线方法。

Conclusion: MECo通过对齐意图与执行，实现了一致、可控和可解释的分子设计，为药物发现中的高保真反馈循环和人机协作工作流程奠定了基础。

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一个理论基础的资源高效数据选择和重加权框架，通过上下文近似(ICA)估计候选训练样本对模型性能的影响，无需参考模型或额外微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式或昂贵的重训练，缺乏系统高效识别高价值训练数据的方法，噪声或偏离目标的样本会稀释监督效果。

Method: 使用上下文近似(ICA)方法，通过在小规模精选保留集上进行上下文条件化，估计模型在候选样本上训练后的保留损失。基于局部线性化，ICA等价于向保留最优解的一阶更新。

Result: 在SFT、DPO和SimPO等不同方法、多种骨干网络和数据集上，ICA重加权持续改善模型对齐效果，且开销极小。

Conclusion: ICA框架为数据选择和重加权提供了理论基础和高效实现，但在快速漂移的在线策略更新方面存在局限，为未来工作指明了方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While
integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to
improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect
predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.
We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide
the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains
statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two
instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and
gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage
high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless
of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented
counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random."
Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with
gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

*Andrejs Sorstkins,Omer Tariq,Muhammad Bilal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种可逆学习框架，通过可逆性度量和选择性状态回滚机制，提高基于价值的强化学习在部分不可逆环境中的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于价值的强化学习智能体在部分不可逆环境中容易产生价值高估和不稳定的问题，特别是在高风险决策场景下。

Method: 使用经验推导的状态-动作可逆性度量Phi(s,a)来量化在固定时间窗口内返回先前状态的可能性，并基于此动态调整时序差分更新中的惩罚项。同时引入选择性回滚操作，当动作的实际回报远低于预期值时，智能体被惩罚并回滚到前一个状态。

Result: 在CliffWalking v0环境中，灾难性跌落减少了99.8%以上，平均回合回报提高了55%。在Taxi v3环境中，非法动作抑制了99.9%以上，累积奖励提高了65.7%，同时显著降低了两个环境中的奖励方差。

Conclusion: 回滚机制是实现安全性和性能提升的关键组件，为安全可靠的顺序决策提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分块方法将时间序列划分为相邻块，导致固定的表示空间，表示能力不足。需要构建选择性表示空间来灵活包含最具信息量的块。

Method: 提出SRS模块，包含可学习的选择性分块和动态重组技术，自适应选择和重排时间序列块。构建了SRSNet模型，由SRS模块和MLP头组成。

Result: SRSNet在多个领域的真实数据集上达到了最先进的性能。SRS模块作为即插即用模块，也能提升现有基于分块模型的性能。

Conclusion: 选择性表示空间能够有效提升时间序列预测性能，SRS模块是一个通用且有效的增强组件。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

TL;DR: 提出了Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO)算法，通过平衡熵信号来解决Agentic RL中过度依赖熵导致的训练崩溃问题，在14个数据集上优于7种主流RL算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流Agentic RL算法过度依赖熵信号来探索高不确定性工具调用步骤，但过度依赖熵会施加额外约束，导致训练崩溃。

Method: AEPO包含两个核心组件：(1)动态熵平衡rollout机制，通过熵预监测自适应分配全局和分支采样预算，对连续高熵工具调用步骤施加分支惩罚；(2)熵平衡策略优化，在高熵裁剪项中插入停止梯度操作，并引入熵感知优势估计。

Result: 在14个挑战性数据集上，AEPO持续优于7种主流RL算法。仅用1K RL样本，Qwen3-14B模型在GAIA上达到47.6%(Pass@1)和65.0%(Pass@5)，在Humanity's Last Exam上达到11.2%(Pass@1)和26.0%(Pass@5)，在WebWalker上达到43.0%(Pass@1)和70.0%(Pass@5)。

Conclusion: AEPO提高了rollout采样多样性，同时保持稳定的策略熵，促进了可扩展的web agent训练。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MX+格式，一种基于微缩放格式的4位块浮点扩展，通过重新利用异常值的指数字段作为扩展尾数来提高精度，在保持低存储开销的同时显著提升大语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的超低位宽BFP变体由于块中的异常值而难以提供合理的语言模型性能，需要一种成本效益高且非侵入性的解决方案来改进微缩放格式。

Method: MX+基于关键洞察：异常值不需要使用其元素数据类型中的指数字段，因此可以重新利用该字段作为扩展尾数，从而提高异常值元素的精度。

Result: 评估显示MX+相比4位MX格式（MXFP4）实现了显著更高的模型性能，存储开销和速度下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: MX+为高效LLM推理提供了MXFP4或MXFP6的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

Motivation: 训练数据和测试数据之间的分布差异导致模型在遇到OOD样本时预测不准确，现有图OOD检测方法因结构冗余导致语义偏移而性能受限。

Method: 提出RedOUT框架，集成结构熵到测试时OOD检测中，引入冗余感知图信息瓶颈(ReGIB)，将目标分解为本质信息和无关冗余，通过最小化结构熵减少解耦的冗余。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验显示RedOUT在OOD检测方面表现优越，平均提升6.7%，在ClinTox/LIPO数据集对上显著超越最佳竞争对手17.3%。

Conclusion: RedOUT通过结构熵最小化有效减少图结构冗余，显著提升了图分类任务中的OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

Motivation: Transformer在表格数据中具有二次复杂度，限制了处理长序列的能力，需要探索更高效的序列模型。

Method: 采用Hydra双向线性时间结构化状态空间模型（SSM）替代Transformer，通过双向上下文聚合减少对输入顺序的敏感性。

Result: 该方法降低了顺序依赖性，预测性能与原始TabPFN模型相当。

Conclusion: Hydra SSM是Transformer在表格数据中的可行替代方案，能在保持性能的同时提高效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN,
demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian
inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from
quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the
exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the
potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space
model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies
in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable
property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless.
We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency
and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this
approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance
competitive to the original TabPFN model.

TL;DR: 提出Conformal Labeling方法，通过控制错误发现率来识别AI预测可被证明可信的实例，确保AI分配标签的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据集的高质量标注成本高昂，AI模型虽然成本较低但存在不可避免的标注错误。现有选择性标注方法缺乏对AI标注质量的理论保证。

Method: 构建每个测试实例的conformal p值，通过比较AI模型的预测置信度与校准实例的误标情况，选择p值低于数据依赖阈值的实例，证明AI预测可信。

Result: 实验证明该方法在图像和文本标注、LLM问答等多种任务中实现了严格的FDR控制和高功率。

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling方法提供了对AI标注质量的理论保证，能够有效控制错误发现率，确保AI分配标签的可靠性。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces

prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal
documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and
graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a
Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and

Motivation: 现有transformer设计在张量并行训练中存在显著的通信开销，特别是MHA-MLP连接需要all-reduce通信，影响了训练效率。

Method: 提出FAL架构，绕过MHA-MLP连接，将第一层注意力输出重定向到后续层的MLP输入；FAL+版本还添加归一化的第一注意力输出到后续层MHA输出以增强MLP输入质量。

Result: FAL减少多GPU训练时间达44%，单GPU吞吐量提升1.18倍，困惑度优于基线GPT；FAL+在保持训练时间不变的情况下实现更低的困惑度。

Conclusion: FAL和FAL+通过优化transformer架构的连接方式，有效减少了通信开销，提高了训练效率和模型质量。

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，能够增强科学知识发现和非专家可解释性，为需要人类注释者参与的领域（如公民科学）扩展了反事实解释的应用范围。

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

Abstract: Galaxy morphologies play an essential role in the study of the evolution of
galaxies. The determination of morphologies is laborious for a large amount of
data giving rise to machine learning-based approaches. Unfortunately, most of
these approaches offer no insight into how the model works and make the results
difficult to understand and explain. We here propose to extend a classical
encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow, allowing us to not only
obtain a good predictive performance but also provide additional information
about the decision process with counterfactual explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼几何的无监督域自适应方法，通过Siegel嵌入将一阶和二阶矩表示为对称正定矩阵，在SPD矩阵流形上使用自然几何距离进行对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督域自适应中的分布偏移问题，现有方法通常使用临时相似性度量在嵌入空间中对齐源域和目标域的低阶统计矩，缺乏几何原理指导。

Method: 使用Siegel嵌入将一阶和二阶矩表示为单个对称正定矩阵，在SPD矩阵共享流形上使用自然几何距离进行同时对齐，保持源域和目标域的均值和协方差结构。

Result: 在图像去噪和图像分类基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，连接了黎曼流形距离与目标域误差界的关系。

Conclusion: 提出的几何自适应方法提供了更忠实的跨域比较度量，通过黎曼几何原理改进了无监督域自适应中的分布对齐。

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经形态无线传感器网络的低功耗在线异常检测框架，使用事件驱动的神经形态传感器和脉冲无线电传输，通过在线假设测试和多臂老虎机框架动态优化传感器查询策略，在严格控制误报率的同时实现高效检测。

Motivation: 针对脑机接口和远程环境监测等应用场景，需要低功耗、高效率的异常检测系统。传统方法难以在保证检测可靠性的同时控制误报率和能耗。

Method: 使用事件驱动的神经形态传感器节点，通过脉冲无线电传输编码本地事件；采用基于e值的在线假设测试方法控制误报率；将传感器查询策略建模为多臂老虎机中的最优臂识别问题进行动态优化。

Result: 性能评估表明，该方法能够在严格的误报率要求下可靠检测异常，同时高效调度传感器通信并实现低检测延迟。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为低功耗在线异常检测提供了一种有效的解决方案，特别适用于资源受限的无线传感器网络应用。

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

TL;DR: 提出FedPPA方法解决联邦学习中模型和数据异构性问题，通过渐进参数对齐和基于熵的加权平均，在非IID数据下提升个性化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中客户端具有异构计算资源和非IID数据，现有个性化联邦学习方法通常忽视模型和数据异构性的共存问题

Method: 渐进参数对齐(FedPPA)：逐步对齐客户端与全局模型的公共层权重，同时保留本地知识；集成基于熵的加权平均

Result: 在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，FedPPA持续优于现有联邦学习算法，在个性化适应方面表现优异

Conclusion: FedPPA能有效缓解客户端更新时全局与局部模型间的不一致性，增强非IID设置下的个性化鲁棒性

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

### [220] [Tawa: Automatic Warp Specialization for Modern GPUs with Asynchronous References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14719)
*Hongzheng Chen,Bin Fan,Alexander Collins,Bastian Hagedorn,Evghenii Gaburov,Masahiro Masuda,Matthew Brookhart,Chris Sullivan,Jason Knight,Zhiru Zhang,Vinod Grover*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tawa是一个自动编译器，能够从高级瓦片化程序生成高性能的warp专用代码，通过异步引用抽象简化GPU编程，在H100 GPU上实现了优于cuBLAS和Triton的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU的专用硬件单元支持高性能异步数据流执行，但传统的SIMT编程模型与这种任务并行硬件不匹配，导致程序可编程性差距。硬件级的warp专用化虽然能实现峰值性能，但需要开发者手动管理复杂的低级通信和软件管道，过程繁琐且容易出错。

Method: 提出Tawa自动编译器，采用新颖的IR抽象——异步引用(aref)来表达warp级通信，无需暴露低级硬件细节。Tawa自动将程序划分为生产者-消费者角色，并管理复杂的数据流管道。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100 GPU上评估代表性LLM内核，Tawa实现了高硬件利用率，相比高度优化的cuBLAS GEMM内核达到1.1倍加速。对于注意力工作负载，相比Triton实现1.2倍加速，并与手工优化的CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3内核性能相当，但编程工作量大幅减少。

Conclusion: Tawa通过自动化warp专用代码生成，显著降低了GPU编程复杂性，同时保持了高性能，为解决GPU编程模型与硬件能力之间的不匹配问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

TL;DR: INDAGO-Nexus是一个多目标搜索方法，用于发现深度强化学习代理的多样化故障场景，相比单目标优化的INDAGO工具，能发现更多独特故障并减少故障发现时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具如INDAGO仅关注最大化故障数量，无法确保发现的故障场景具有多样性或揭示不同的错误类型。

Method: 使用多目标进化算法，联合优化故障可能性和测试场景多样性，采用多种多样性指标和Pareto前沿选择策略。

Result: 在三个DRL代理上评估：人形步行者、自动驾驶汽车和停车代理。相比INDAGO，INDAGO-Nexus在SDC和停车场景中分别发现83%和40%更多独特故障，所有代理的故障发现时间减少达67%。

Conclusion: INDAGO-Nexus通过多目标优化方法显著提高了测试效果，能够发现更多样化的故障场景并加速故障发现过程。

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

TL;DR: 该论文提出未来摘要预测(FSP)方法，通过预测长文本的紧凑摘要表示来改进语言模型的长期推理能力，相比传统下一词预测和多词预测方法在数学、推理和编程任务上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下一词预测(NTP)在长期推理、规划和创意写作方面存在局限，多词预测(MTP)只能捕获短程依赖关系，改进有限。需要一种能捕捉长期依赖关系的方法。

Method: 提出未来摘要预测(FSP)，训练一个辅助头来预测长文本未来的紧凑表示。探索两种变体：手工制作的摘要（如词袋摘要）和学习的摘要（使用从右向左训练的反向语言模型生成的嵌入）。

Result: 在大规模预训练实验（30亿和80亿参数模型）中，FSP在数学、推理和编程基准测试上相比NTP和MTP都有改进。

Conclusion: FSP通过预测长期未来的紧凑表示，有效提升了语言模型在长文本生成任务中的性能，为改进语言模型的长期推理能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models
(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative
writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.
Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: 所提出的主动干扰源定位框架通过智能路径规划有效提高了定位效率，为城市环境中的干扰源检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose an active jammer localization framework that combines Bayesian
optimization with acquisition-aware path planning. Unlike passive crowdsourced
methods, our approach adaptively guides a mobile agent to collect high-utility
Received Signal Strength measurements while accounting for urban obstacles and
mobility constraints. For this, we modified the A* algorithm, A-UCB*, by
incorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs, leading to
high-acquisition planned paths. Simulations on realistic urban scenarios show
that the proposed method achieves accurate localization with fewer measurements
compared to uninformed baselines, demonstrating consistent performance under
different environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Hebbian学习在机器学习中存在连接更新无约束和缺乏反馈调节的问题，限制了其在复杂网络架构和任务中的有效扩展。

Method: SPHeRe通过局部辅助非线性块整合正交性和结构信息保留，结构信息保留损失通过轻量级投影反向传播到输入作为反馈调节，正交性约束控制更新幅度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet等标准图像分类基准测试中达到无监督突触可塑性方法的SOTA性能，在持续学习和迁移学习场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了Hebbian无监督学习规则在现代深度学习框架中的竞争力和潜力，证明了无需严格依赖反向传播的高效生物启发学习算法的可能性。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏性在现代GPU上能加速训练和推理，但在精度上仍落后于无结构动态稀疏训练，主要原因是表达能力受限。

Method: 为每个层学习单个排列矩阵与结构化权重矩阵联合优化，应用于块状、N:M和对角线三种典型结构。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和WikiText-103上，PA-DST在90-95%稀疏度下达到与无结构基线相当的精度，同时训练速度快1.21倍，推理速度快2.9倍。

Conclusion: 结构+学习排列的组合在精度和效率之间找到了最佳平衡点。

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 时间序列数据具有动态特性，存在分布偏移问题。现有研究主要关注时间偏移，但对概念漂移的处理关注较少，需要开发能同时处理两种偏移的统一方法

Method: 提出ShifTS框架：1）先处理时间偏移；2）使用软注意力机制从回望期和预测期时间序列中寻找不变模式来处理概念漂移

Conclusion: ShifTS框架通过先处理时间偏移再处理概念漂移的统一方法，有效解决了时间序列预测中的分布偏移问题，显著提升了预测性能

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型依赖特征工程，神经网络能自动学习表示但缺乏可解释性且需要专用硬件。需要一种既能自动学习有用表示又保持可解释性的方法。

Method: 提出LeaPR模型，使用LLM合成特征函数代码，开发两种算法：基于FunSearch的特征学习算法和基于ID3的决策树变体算法，在节点分裂时按需生成新特征。

Result: 在象棋位置评估、图像和文本分类任务中，LeaPR模型学习到高质量、无需神经网络的预测器，性能与神经网络相当。

Conclusion: LeaPR提供了一个灵活的端到端学习范式，能够学习可解释的表示，特征和预测结果都可以被直接检查和理解。

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

Motivation: SSMs作为Transformer的替代方案，在长上下文和长形式生成中具有效率优势，但存在理论上的局限性，无法准确解决"真正长形式"生成问题。

Method: 通过理论分析证明SSMs的局限性，然后提出通过让SSMs交互式访问外部工具来克服这一限制，并设计问题相关的训练数据。

Conclusion: SSMs在结合外部工具的情况下，可以成为Transformer在交互式工具和智能体场景中的高效替代方案，能够解决任何可处理的问题并泛化到任意问题长度/复杂度。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers
for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context
and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of
computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical
result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''
generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main
competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated
by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that
given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs
can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem
length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our
theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable
length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.
These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to
Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.

measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

Motivation: 研究真实数据集上的核回归学习曲线预测问题，旨在建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端理论框架。

Method: 提出Hermite本征结构假设(HEA)，通过经验数据协方差矩阵和目标函数的经验多项式分解来近似核的特征值和特征函数，从而预测学习曲线。

Result: HEA在真实图像数据上表现良好，能够准确预测学习曲线，并且发现MLPs在特征学习阶段也遵循HEA预测的Hermite多项式学习顺序。

Conclusion: HEA框架证明了在真实数据集上为复杂学习算法建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端理论是可行的。

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

Motivation: 传统序列决策理论假设所有错误都可恢复，但在高风险AI应用中，单个错误可能导致不可逆损害。现有方法依赖导师帮助，但导师并非总是可用。

Conclusion: 谨慎探索策略能够在无导师情况下安全地部署学习智能体，通过避免不可逆错误来保护系统安全，为高风险AI应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注强化学习后训练中出现的新行为，而本文从不同角度探讨是否能在推理时通过纯采样从基础模型中激发类似的推理能力。

Method: 受马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛技术启发，提出了一种简单的迭代采样算法，利用基础模型自身的似然函数进行采样。

Result: 该方法在MATH500、HumanEval和GPQA等单次任务上显著提升了推理能力，几乎匹配甚至超越了强化学习后训练的效果，同时避免了多样性崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、精选数据集或验证器，在难以验证的领域具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Motivation: 现有可解释性方法依赖人工检查且仅限于简单任务，自动化方法虽然可扩展但常忽略特征间交互且依赖外部LLM和数据集质量。

Method: WeightLens直接从学习权重解释特征，无需解释模型或数据集；CircuitLens捕捉特征激活如何从组件交互中产生，揭示电路级动态。

Result: WeightLens在上下文无关特征上匹配或超越现有方法性能；CircuitLens能识别仅基于激活的方法无法发现的电路动态。

Conclusion: 这两种方法提高了可解释性鲁棒性，增强了电路的可扩展机制分析，同时保持效率和质量。

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型原理的新采样器，用于加速循环深度语言模型的生成过程，在保持相同时间预算下实现更高效的并行计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环深度语言模型通过层重复增加计算能力，在现代语言建模任务中表现出优势，但其生成效率有待提升。本文旨在探索循环深度模型与扩散语言模型之间的关系，并开发更高效的生成方法。

Method: 基于循环深度模型与扩散模型的相似性，开发了一种新的扩散强制采样器。该采样器在每个前向传递中解码新token，同时通过循环并行细化这些token的潜在状态。

Result: 该采样器可直接应用于现有的35亿参数循环深度transformer，无需调优即可实现高达5倍的加速。理论分析表明，在相同时间预算下，该采样器的表达能力严格优于基线自回归生成方法。

Conclusion: 该采样器不仅为循环深度模型在推理时提供了一种高效的并行计算机制，还表明此类模型可以自然地被视为强大的连续（尽管是因果的）扩散语言模型。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了生物信息神经网络(BINNs)，用于作物基因组预测和选择，通过整合数千个SNPs与多组学数据及先验生物知识，显著提高了预测精度并揭示了非线性生物学关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因型到表型(G2P)模型依赖直接映射，精度有限，育种者需进行大量昂贵的田间试验。现有整合分子表型的模型虽然预测效果更好，但在基因组选择(GS)中不实用，因为部署时无法获得此类数据。

Method: BINNs通过编码通路级归纳偏置，在训练时利用多组学数据，在推理时仅使用基因型数据。应用于玉米基因表达和多环境田间试验数据，在稀疏数据条件下提高预测精度。

Result: 在玉米数据中，BINNs将秩相关精度提高了56%，在合成代谢组学基准中，预测误差比传统神经网络降低了75%。BINNs的潜在变量与实验量相关，表明学习了生物学相关表示。

Conclusion: BINNs建立了一个框架，利用中间领域信息提高基因组预测精度，揭示非线性生物学关系，可指导基因组选择、候选基因选择、通路富集和基因编辑优先排序。

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

Result: 在ImageNet 256²上达到1-NFE FID 2.85，优于相同DiT架构的MeanFlow；在FLUX.1-12B和Qwen-Image-20B上，4 NFEs时实现更好的多样性同时保持教师级质量

Conclusion: π-Flow通过简单模仿教师行为实现稳定可扩展的训练，避免了质量-多样性权衡问题

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

Abstract: Power grids increasingly need real-time situational awareness under the
ever-evolving cyberthreat landscape. Advances in snapshot-based system
identification approaches have enabled accurately estimating states and
topology from a snapshot of measurement data, under random bad data and
topology errors. However, modern interactive, targeted false data can stay
undetectable to these methods, and significantly compromise estimation
accuracy. This work advances system identification that combines snapshot-based
method with time-series model via Bayesian Integration, to advance cyber
resiliency against both random and targeted false data. Using a distance-based
time-series model, this work can leverage historical data of different
distributions induced by changes in grid topology and other settings. The
normal system behavior captured from historical data is integrated into system
identification through a Bayesian treatment, to make solutions robust to
targeted false data. We experiment on mixed random anomalies (bad data,
topology error) and targeted false data injection attack (FDIA) to demonstrate
our method's 1) cyber resilience: achieving over 70% reduction in estimation
error under FDIA; 2) anomalous data identification: being able to alarm and
locate anomalous data; 3) almost linear scalability: achieving comparable speed
with the snapshot-based baseline, both taking <1min per time tick on the large
2,383-bus system using a laptop CPU.

Abstract: Existing or planned power grids need to evaluate survivability under extreme
events, like a number of peak load overloading conditions, which could possibly
cause system collapses (i.e. blackouts). For realistic extreme events that are
correlated or share similar patterns, it is reasonable to expect that the
dominant vulnerability or failure sources behind them share the same locations
but with different severity. Early warning diagnosis that proactively
identifies the key vulnerabilities responsible for a number of system collapses
of interest can significantly enhance resilience. This paper proposes a
multi-period sparse optimization method, enabling the discovery of {persistent
failure sources} across a sequence of collapsed systems with increasing system
stress, such as rising demand or worsening contingencies. This work defines
persistency and efficiently integrates persistency constraints to capture the
``hidden'' evolving vulnerabilities. Circuit-theory based power flow
formulations and circuit-inspired optimization heuristics are used to
facilitate the scalability of the method. Experiments on benchmark systems show
that the method reliably tracks persistent vulnerability locations under
increasing load stress, and solves with scalability to large systems ({on
average} taking {around} 200 s per scenario on 2000+ bus systems).

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in the security and safety of
cyber-physical control systems, and accurately distinguishing between different
anomaly types is crucial for system recovery and mitigation. This study
proposes a dual detection framework for anomaly detection and discrimination.
By leveraging the dynamic characteristics of control loops and the stealthiness
features of integrity attacks, the closed-loop stealthiness condition is first
derived, and two dedicated detectors are designed and deployed on the
controller side and the plant side, respectively, enabling joint plant fault
and cyber attack detection. Moreover, by jointly analyzing the residual
response of the two detectors corresponding to different anomalies, it is
proved that the proposed method can distinguish between faults and integrity
attacks due to the detectors' individual residual spaces. According to the
detector's residual space, the fault and attack detection performance is
further improved by a two-stage optimization scheme. Simulation results
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: DiffOPF能够生成具有良好成本和约束满足权衡的统计可信调度方案，解决了传统单值求解器的局限性。

Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) is a multi-valued, non-convex mapping from loads
to dispatch setpoints. The variability of system parameters (e.g., admittances,
topology) further contributes to the multiplicity of dispatch setpoints for a
given load. Existing deep learning OPF solvers are single-valued and thus fail
to capture the variability of system parameters unless fully represented in the
feature space, which is prohibitive. To solve this problem, we introduce a
diffusion-based OPF solver, termed \textit{DiffOPF}, that treats OPF as a
conditional sampling problem. The solver learns the joint distribution of loads
and dispatch setpoints from operational history, and returns the marginal
dispatch distributions conditioned on loads. Unlike single-valued solvers,
DiffOPF enables sampling statistically credible warm starts with favorable cost
and constraint satisfaction trade-offs. We explore the sample complexity of
DiffOPF to ensure the OPF solution within a prescribed distance from the
optimization-based solution, and verify this experimentally on power system
benchmarks.

Result: 在1D单积分器设定点跟踪和2D独轮车运动学轨迹跟踪场景中的仿真结果表明，BCBF-GEKF方法提供了更少保守的控制和更高的安全性

Conclusion: BCBF-GEKF方法能够有效处理状态相关的测量噪声，在保持安全性的同时减少控制保守性

Abstract: Safety-critical control is imperative for deploying autonomous systems in the
real world. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer strong safety guarantees
when accurate system and sensor models are available. However, widely used
additive, fixed-noise models are not representative of complex sensor
modalities with state-dependent error characteristics. Although CBFs have been
designed to mitigate uncertainty using fixed worst-case bounds on measurement
noise, this approach can lead to overly-conservative control. To solve this
problem, we extend the Belief Control Barrier Function (BCBF) framework to
accommodate state-dependent measurement noise via the Generalized Extended
Kalman Filter (GEKF) algorithm, which models measurement noise as a linear
function of the state. Using the original BCBF framework as baseline, we
demonstrate the performance of the BCBF-GEKF approach through simulation
results on a 1D single integrator setpoint tracking scenario and 2D unicycle
kinematics trajectory tracking scenario. Our results confirm that the BCBF-GEKF
approach offers less conservative control with greater safety.

### [244] [Resource-Aware Stealthy Attacks in Vehicle Platoons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14119)
*Ali Eslami,Mohammad Pirani*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对CAV车辆编队的隐蔽攻击方法，攻击者可以引导编队按照期望轨迹行驶而不被检测，分析了攻击可行性条件、通信拓扑和控制协议的影响，以及攻击所需资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注防御攻击，但对隐蔽攻击者的关注较少。CAV编队严重依赖车辆间通信，容易受到攻击，即使是轻微操纵也可能导致严重后果。

Method: 通过设计隐蔽攻击方法，分析攻击在何种条件下可行，研究通信拓扑和控制协议对攻击的影响，并评估攻击者所需的资源。

Result: 研究发现当前编队架构和异常检测机制存在关键弱点，攻击者能够成功实施隐蔽攻击而不被发现。

Conclusion: 通过分析隐蔽攻击所需的资源，揭示了系统漏洞，为设计更有弹性的对抗措施提供了方法，有助于开发更安全可靠的CAV系统。

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are transforming modern
transportation by enabling cooperative applications such as vehicle platooning,
where multiple vehicles travel in close formation to improve efficiency and
safety. However, the heavy reliance on inter-vehicle communication makes
platoons highly susceptible to attacks, where even subtle manipulations can
escalate into severe physical consequences. While existing research has largely
focused on defending against attacks, far less attention has been given to
stealthy adversaries that aim to covertly manipulate platoon behavior. This
paper introduces a new perspective on the attack design problem by
demonstrating how attackers can guide platoons toward their own desired
trajectories while remaining undetected. We outline conditions under which such
attacks are feasible, analyze their dependence on communication topologies and
control protocols, and investigate the resources required by the attacker. By
characterizing the resources needed to launch stealthy attacks, we address
system vulnerabilities and informing the design of resilient countermeasures.
Our findings reveal critical weaknesses in current platoon architectures and
anomaly detection mechanisms and provide methods to develop more secure and
trustworthy CAV systems.

*Hiroki Sakamoto,Kazuhiro Sato*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对深度状态空间模型的压缩方法，具有可证明的输出误差保证，通过优化h²误差范数实现参数减少80%且无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究包含线性-二次输出系统作为内部块的深度状态空间模型，旨在开发具有理论误差保证的压缩方法，解决现有模型降阶方法在深度SSM压缩中的局限性。

Method: 首先推导两个深度SSM之间输出误差的上界，该界限可通过层间LQO系统的h²误差范数表示；基于此界限，构建关于h²误差范数的优化问题，并开发基于梯度的模型降阶方法。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试的IMDb任务上，压缩方法表现出色，无需重新训练即可减少约80%可训练参数，性能仅下降4-5%。

Conclusion: 提出的压缩方法为深度状态空间模型提供了理论支撑的压缩方案，显著减少参数数量同时保持良好性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We study deep state-space models (Deep SSMs) that contain
linear-quadratic-output (LQO) systems as internal blocks and present a
compression method with a provable output error guarantee. We first derive an
upper bound on the output error between two Deep SSMs and show that the bound
can be expressed via the $h^2$-error norms between the layerwise LQO systems,
thereby providing a theoretical justification for existing model order
reduction (MOR)-based compression. Building on this bound, we formulate an
optimization problem in terms of the $h^2$-error norm and develop a
gradient-based MOR method. On the IMDb task from the Long Range Arena
benchmark, we demonstrate that our compression method achieves strong
performance. Moreover, unlike prior approaches, we reduce roughly 80% of
trainable parameters without retraining, with only a 4-5% performance drop.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多周期两阶段PTDF模型，共同优化输电升级和储能选址/容量配置，采用信任域多割Benders分解方法，在2000节点德州系统上实现低于1%的最优性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为满足日益增长的电力需求和可再生能源并网需求，储能系统作为提供时间灵活性和缓解拥堵的关键资产，需要与输电扩展规划协同优化。

Method: 开发了多周期两阶段PTDF公式，采用基于信任域的多割Benders分解方案，从每个代表性日的最优解进行热启动。

Result: 在2000节点合成德州系统的高可再生能源情景下，最终最优性差距低于1%，规划结果在约180个节点部署储能（占峰值可再生能源容量的32%）。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于PTDF的方法能够有效处理大规模分布式储能系统，在高空间分辨率下展现出良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) optimizes power grid upgrades and
investments to ensure reliable, efficient, and cost-effective electricity
delivery while addressing grid constraints. To support growing demand and
renewable energy integration, energy storage is emerging as a pivotal asset
that provides temporal flexibility and alleviates congestion. This paper
develops a multiperiod, two-stage PTDF formulation that co-optimizes
transmission upgrades and storage siting/sizing. To ensure scalability, a
trust-region, multicut Benders scheme warm-started from per-representative-day
optima is proposed. Applied to a 2,000-bus synthetic Texas system under
high-renewable projections, the method attains final optimality gaps below 1%
and yields a plan with storage at about 180 nodes (32% of peak renewable
capacity). These results demonstrate that the proposed PTDF-based methodology
efficiently handles large distributed storage fleets, demonstrating scalability
at high spatial resolution

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一个媒介传播疾病的流行病模型，扩展了经典的SIS模型，包含人类和媒介两个种群及其交叉传染机制，通过单调系统理论分析疾病动态，并评估了媒介控制和防护措施两种控制策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为媒介传播疾病建立更准确的数学模型，以理解人类与媒介之间的交叉传染动态，并为疾病控制提供理论依据。

Method: 基于经典SIS模型扩展，建立包含人类和媒介两个种群的常微分方程组模型，利用单调系统理论分析全局渐近行为，并引入两种控制策略进行分析。

Result: 确定了疾病快速根除的条件（所有轨迹收敛到无病平衡点）或收敛到唯一地方性平衡点的条件，评估了两种控制策略的影响并确定了最优控制策略。

Conclusion: 该模型为媒介传播疾病的动态分析和控制策略制定提供了有效的数学工具，能够指导实际疾病防控工作。

Abstract: We propose an epidemic model for the spread of vector-borne diseases. The
model, which is built extending the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible
model, accounts for two populations -- humans and vectors -- and for
cross-contagion between the two species, whereby humans become infected upon
interaction with carrier vectors, and vectors become carriers after interaction
with infected humans. We formulate the model as a system of ordinary
differential equations and leverage monotone systems theory to rigorously
characterize the epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we characterize the global
asymptotic behavior of the disease, determining conditions for quick
eradication of the disease (i.e., for which all trajectories converge to a
disease-free equilibrium), or convergence to a (unique) endemic equilibrium.
Then, we incorporate two control actions: namely, vector control and incentives
to adopt protection measures. Using the derived mathematical tools, we assess
the impact of these two control actions and determine the optimal control
policy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于谱半径稳定性约束的分布式逆变器电压-无功控制方法，相比现有凸约束方法能更有效地进行电压调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式能源的集成需要自主动态电压调节，但设计不当的分散式电压-无功控制可能导致电网反馈不稳定。

Method: 使用线性化潮流方法建模电网-VVC闭环动态，利用历史数据改进LinDistFlow模型，通过最小化稳态电压偏差来设计VVC斜率，并引入非凸谱半径稳定性约束。

Result: 在真实馈线上的仿真表明，使用谱半径约束比现有凸约束方法能实现更有效的电压调节。

Conclusion: 谱半径稳定性约束在分布式逆变器电压控制中具有优越性能，为电网稳定性提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: Integration of distributed energy resources has created a need for
autonomous, dynamic voltage regulation. Decentralized Volt-VAr Control (VVC) of
grid-connected inverters presents a unique opportunity for voltage management
but, if designed poorly, can lead to unstable behavior when in feedback with
the grid. We model the grid-VVC closed-loop dynamics with a linearized power
flow approach, leveraging historical data, which shows improvement over the
commonly used LinDistFlow model. This model is used to design VVC slopes by
minimizing steady-state voltage deviation from the nominal value, subject to a
non-convex spectral radius stability constraint, which has not been previously
implemented within this context. We compare this constraint to existing convex
restrictions and demonstrate, through simulations on a realistic feeder, that
using the spectral radius results in more effective voltage regulation.

Abstract: To address growing cybersecurity challenges in modern power dispatch systems,
this paper proposes a multi-layer modeling and optimization framework for SCADA
systems enhanced with quantum key distribution (QKD). While most existing
applications of QKD in the power sector focus on building secure point-to-point
communication tunnels, they rarely consider the system-level coupling between
key dynamics and control scheduling. In contrast, our approach integrates
quantum key generation, consumption, inventory prediction, and control latency
into a unified model, enabling key-aware reconfiguration of SCADA control
chains based on task security demands and real-time resource constraints. To
resolve conflicts in key resource allocation between transmission system
operators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs), we formulate a
bi-level Stackelberg game and transform it into a mathematical program with
complementarity constraints (MPCC). We further develop an efficient Level
Decomposition-Complementarity Pruning (LD-CP) algorithm to solve the problem.
To support reproducible evaluation, we build an end-to-end co-simulation
platform that integrates physical-layer disruptions via OpenQKD-Sim,
Q3P/IEC-104 protocol stack binding, and real-time control-chain monitoring
through Grafana. Experimental results on the IEEE 39- and 118-bus systems show
that our method increases task success rate by 25%, reduces peak frequency
deviation by 70%, and improves key utilization to 83%. This work lays the
foundation for future quantum-secure control systems in power grid operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地磁感应通信因其优异的穿透能力成为地下通信网络的有力候选，但MI快速衰落等新发现仍处于早期阶段，需要明确定义的网络架构来集成到下一代天地空地下网络中。

Method: 对TTE MIC进行系统综述，包括应用比较、信道建模原理分析、信道功率增益的物理参数分解、MI快速衰落的几何模型分析、中继技术总结和网络协议框架探索。

Result: 提出了一个支持TCP/IP和Linux的MIC框架，使研究人员能够利用Linux资源和深度学习平台加速SAGUI网络中MIC的发展。

Conclusion: 识别了剩余的研究挑战、开放问题和有前景的新技术，以推进MIC研究的发展，特别是在SAGUI网络集成方面。

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication (MIC) has emerged as a promising
candidate for underground communication networks due to its excellent
penetration capabilities. Integration with Space-Air-Ground-Underground (SAGUI)
networks in next-generation mobile communication systems requires a
well-defined network architecture. A recent discovery in MIC research, MI fast
fading, remains in its early stages and presents unique challenges. This paper
provides a comprehensive survey on through-the-earth (TTE) MIC, covering MI
applications, channel modeling, point-to-point MIC design, relay techniques,
network frameworks, and emerging technologies. We compare various MIC
applications to highlight TTE-specific challenges and review the principles of
channel modeling, addressing both MI slow fading and MI fast fading, along with
its potential impact on existing MIC theories. We conduct a fine-grained
decomposition of MI channel power gain into four distinct physical parameters,
and propose a novel geometric model to analyze MI fast fading. We also
summarize MI relay techniques, examine crosstalk effects in relay and
high-density networks, and explore key research tasks within the OSI framework
for a holistic MI network protocol in SAGUI. To bridge the gaps identified, we
propose a MIC framework that supports TCP/IP and Linux, enabling full
implementation of existing and emerging MIC solutions. This framework empowers
researchers to leverage Linux resources and deep learning platforms for
accelerated development of MIC in SAGUI networks. Remaining research
challenges, open issues, and promising novel techniques are further identified
to advance MIC research.

Motivation: 解决在安全关键约束下力控非完整移动机器人的稳定控制问题，需要同时保证系统稳定性和安全性。

Method: 基于gamma m-QP框架设计连续时不变控制律，构建全局时不变严格Lyapunov函数作为CLF，利用车辆动力学的级联结构通过积分器反步法开发CBF。

Result: 主要结果保证了闭环系统的渐近稳定性和安全性，仿真和实验结果验证了方法的有效性和性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了力控非完整移动机器人在安全约束下的稳定控制问题，统一了稳定性和安全性保证。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the stabilization problem for force-controlled
nonholonomic mobile robots under safety-critical constraints. We propose a
continuous, time-invariant control law based on the gamma m-quadratic
programming (gamma m-QP) framework, which unifies control Lyapunov functions
(CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs) to enforce both stability and
safety in the closed-loop system. For the first time, we construct a global,
time-invariant, strict Lyapunov function for the closed-loop nonholonomic
mobile robot system with a nominal stabilization controller in polar
coordinates; this strict Lyapunov function then serves as the CLF in the QP
design. Next, by exploiting the inherent cascaded structure of the vehicle
dynamics, we develop a CBF for the mobile robot via an integrator backstepping
procedure. Our main results guarantee both asymptotic stability and safety for
the closed-loop system. Both the simulation and experimental results are
presented to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出DOTechnique方法，通过决策一致性而非输出相似性来确定模型有效性，在缺乏明确有效性边界时仍能高效识别有效区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型有效性对决策过程至关重要，但传统方法依赖预定义有效性框架，这些框架可能不可用或不充分。

Method: 通过评估替代模型是否与高保真模型产生等效决策来确定有效性，集成领域约束和符号推理来缩小搜索空间。

Result: 以高速公路变道系统为例，展示了DOTechnique能够发现仿真模型的有效性区域。

Conclusion: 该技术有潜力通过决策者上下文来支持模型有效性的发现。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SOTA ASR系统主要依赖声学信息而忽略了多模态上下文，但视觉信息对于消歧和适应至关重要。特别是在科学演示场景中，演示文稿幻灯片包含重要的领域特定术语信息。

Method: 首先创建多模态演示基准并自动分析领域特定术语转录；然后通过数据增强方法扩充缺乏幻灯片的数据集；最后使用增强数据集训练融合多模态信息的语音模型。

Result: 训练得到的模型在所有词汇上相对基线模型降低了约34%的词错误率，在领域特定术语上降低了约35%的词错误率。

Conclusion: 集成演示文稿幻灯片等视觉信息能够显著提升ASR系统在科学演示场景中的性能，特别是在处理领域特定术语方面效果显著。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在因果推理任务中容易产生因果幻觉，即使在没有足够证据支持的情况下也会错误地推断因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨大型语言模型是否像人类一样容易产生因果幻觉，特别是在经典的认知科学范式——列联判断任务中。

Method: 构建了包含1000个医学场景的空列联数据集，在这些场景中可用信息不足以建立变量间的因果关系，然后让LLMs评估潜在原因的有效性。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统地推断出没有根据的因果关系，显示出对因果幻觉的强烈易感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设，对在需要准确因果推理的领域使用语言模型提出了担忧。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

TL;DR: GammaZero提出了基于动作中心图表示的学习框架，用于在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程中指导规划。该方法通过图神经网络学习小规模问题的启发式策略，并能零样本泛化到更大规模的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要领域特定的神经网络架构且难以扩展，GammaZero旨在开发统一的图表示框架，实现跨问题规模的泛化能力。

Method: 将信念状态转换为动作中心图，使用图神经网络从专家演示中学习价值函数和策略，然后应用这些学习到的启发式来指导蒙特卡洛树搜索。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在相同规模问题上与BetaZero性能相当，同时能零样本泛化到训练时未见过的2-4倍大规模问题，保持解质量的同时减少搜索需求。

Conclusion: GammaZero通过动作中心图表示实现了POMDP规划的可扩展性，证明了学习到的结构模式可以从小问题迁移到大问题的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

Conclusion: 该框架为共识声明生成提供了具有可证明公平性保证的结构化方法，通过社会选择理论原则实现了改进的公平性表现。

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出STEMS框架，一种安全约束的多智能体强化学习方法，用于协调建筑能源管理，通过空间-时间图表示学习和控制屏障函数实现安全保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多建筑能源系统面临的三个关键挑战：空间-时间信息利用不足、缺乏严格安全保证和系统复杂性，以实现碳减排、提高舒适度和降低能源成本。

Method: 集成两个核心组件：(1) 使用GCN-Transformer融合架构的空间-时间图表示学习框架，捕捉建筑间关系和时序模式；(2) 结合控制屏障函数的安全约束多智能体强化学习算法，提供数学安全保证。

Result: 在真实建筑数据集上的实验显示，STEMS相比现有方法实现21%成本降低、18%排放减少，安全违规从35.1%降至5.6%，同时保持仅0.13的不适比例。

Conclusion: STEMS框架在极端天气条件下表现出强鲁棒性，在不同建筑类型中保持有效性，为协调建筑能源管理提供了安全可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于多智能体AI系统的统一建模框架，包含主机智能体模型和任务生命周期模型，定义了31个形式化属性来确保系统的正确性、可靠性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体AI系统的通信协议碎片化，存在语义鸿沟，无法进行严格的系统属性分析，存在架构错位和可被利用的协调问题风险。

Method: 引入两个基础模型：主机智能体模型（负责与用户交互、任务分解和编排）和任务生命周期模型（详细描述子任务从创建到完成的状态转换），并定义了17个主机智能体属性和14个任务生命周期属性。

Result: 建立了第一个严格基础、领域无关的框架，用于系统化分析、设计和部署正确的、可靠的和鲁棒的多智能体AI系统。

Conclusion: 该框架为多AI智能体系统的行为推理提供了统一的语义基础，能够进行形式化验证、检测协调边界情况和预防死锁与安全漏洞。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据和视觉图像预测文化遗产退化程度，在数据稀缺情况下实现76.9%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产面临气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测方法无法捕捉环境因素与材料退化之间的复杂相互作用

Method: 改进PerceiverIO架构，采用简化编码器(64D潜空间)防止小数据集过拟合，使用自适应Barlow Twins损失促进模态互补性

Result: 在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比传感器单独使用(61.5%)和图像单独使用(46.2%)有明显优势

Conclusion: 架构简化结合对比正则化可在数据稀缺的遗产监测场景中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous
evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to
evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that
our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.
To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete
framework as an open-source repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习研究进展迅速，但在商业视频游戏中的采用仍然缓慢。本文旨在解决游戏AI社区在实际使用RL驱动NPC时面临的挑战，并探索RL与传统行为树的结合点。

Method: 使用AMD Schola插件在Unreal Engine中训练RL代理，创建多任务NPC，在受"最后生还者"启发的复杂3D环境中，展示了将RL模型与行为树联合训练的方法论。

Result: 证明了RL与行为树结合方法的可行性，成功创建了具备多种技能的多任务NPC，并在复杂3D环境中进行了验证。

Conclusion: RL与行为树的结合是一个值得进一步探索的关键交汇点，虽然已有研究提出这一方向，但实际采用仍然罕见，本文通过实际案例展示了其应用潜力。

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JEDA是一个用于临床订单检索的双编码器系统，能够直接从临床对话中检索规范订单，无需LLM重写，提供实时、稳定的订单识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床对话包含显性指令和隐性推理，现有系统依赖LLM重写导致延迟、不稳定和不透明，阻碍实时订单处理。

Method: 使用PubMedBERT初始化，通过对比学习目标微调，将异质意图表达对齐到共享订单概念，支持直接检索和无查询模式的环境对话编码。

Result: JEDA在实践中取得显著提升，大幅优于基础编码器和最新开源嵌入模型，提供快速、可解释、无LLM的实时检索层。

Conclusion: JEDA成功实现了将环境上下文与可操作临床订单实时链接的目标，具有噪声鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法对奖励函数规范高度敏感，这限制了其广泛应用。现有方法需要手动设计奖励函数，过程繁琐且容易出错。

Method: 使用基础模型从自然语言规范自动生成奖励机器（RM），将语言嵌入与RM自动机状态关联，实现跨任务泛化。

Result: 在多个挑战性环境中验证了ARM-FM的有效性，展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ARM-FM通过结合基础模型和奖励机器，实现了自动化的组合式奖励设计，解决了强化学习中奖励函数设计的核心挑战。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究主要关注单轮提示，而真实骚扰通常发生在多轮交互中，需要评估LLM代理在多轮互动中的安全性。

Method: 构建了包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、基于重复博弈理论的多代理模拟、三种针对记忆、规划和微调的越狱攻击方法，以及混合评估框架。使用LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemini-2.0-flash进行测试。

Result: 微调后骚扰成功率大幅提升（Llama：95.78-96.89% vs 57.25-64.19%；Gemini：99.33% vs 98.46%），拒绝率降至1-2%。侮辱和谩骂是最普遍的毒性行为。攻击后的代理再现了类似人类的攻击模式。

Conclusion: 多轮和理论基础的攻击不仅成功率高，还能模拟人类骚扰动态，需要开发强大的安全防护措施来确保在线平台的安全性和责任性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

Conclusion: LiveResearchBench和DeepEval为深度研究系统提供了严格的评估基础，识别了现有系统的局限性和改进方向，为开发更可靠的深度研究系统提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released

TL;DR: GuardSpace是一个保护大语言模型在微调过程中安全对齐的框架，通过安全敏感子空间和有害抵抗零空间来维持安全机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在微调过程中容易丧失预训练的安全对齐能力，导致产生有害响应，需要一种方法来保护安全机制。

Method: 使用协方差预处理奇异值分解将预训练权重分解为安全相关和安全无关组件，初始化低秩适配器时冻结安全相关部分，并构建零空间投影器限制适配器更新对有害提示的影响。

Result: 在多个预训练模型和下游任务上，GuardSpace优于现有方法，对Llama-2-7B-Chat在GSM8K上的微调，将平均有害分数从14.4%降至3.6%，准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace能有效保护大语言模型在微调过程中的安全对齐，同时保持或提升任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Terrarium框架，用于在基于LLM的多智能体系统中进行细粒度的安全、隐私和安全性研究，通过重新利用黑板设计创建模块化、可配置的多智能体协作测试平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统能够自动化繁琐的用户任务，但引入了新的风险，包括错位攻击、恶意方攻击导致智能体被破坏或用户数据被盗。

Method: 重新利用黑板设计创建模块化、可配置的多智能体协作测试平台，识别关键攻击向量如错位、恶意智能体、通信被破坏和数据投毒，实现三种协作场景和四种代表性攻击。

Result: 开发了Terrarium框架，提供了快速原型设计、评估和迭代防御与设计的工具，展示了框架的灵活性。

Conclusion: Terrarium旨在加速可信多智能体系统的进展，通过提供工具来快速原型设计、评估和迭代防御与设计。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: MASC是一个元认知框架，通过实时无监督的步骤级错误检测和自我纠正来增强多智能体系统的鲁棒性，防止错误级联传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在协作解决问题方面表现出色，但对级联错误很脆弱——单个错误步骤可能在智能体间传播并破坏整体轨迹。

Method: MASC采用两种互补设计：(1) 下一执行重构，从查询和交互历史预测下一步的嵌入以捕捉因果一致性；(2) 原型引导增强，学习正常步骤嵌入的原型先验，在稀疏上下文下稳定重构和异常评分。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC始终优于所有基线方法，步骤级错误检测AUC-ROC提升高达8.47%；当集成到不同MAS框架中时，在各种架构上都能带来一致的端到端性能提升。

Conclusion: MASC的元认知监控和针对性纠正能够以最小开销缓解错误传播，为多智能体系统提供了有效的错误检测和纠正机制。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了AI4Service新范式，通过Alpha-Service框架实现主动实时服务，解决了何时干预和如何服务两个核心挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI服务大多是被动的，只能响应显式用户指令。真正智能的助手应该能够预测用户需求并在适当时机主动采取行动。

Method: 基于AI眼镜，采用多智能体系统实现Alpha-Service框架，包含输入单元、中央处理单元、算术逻辑单元、内存单元和输出单元五个核心组件。

Result: 通过案例研究（实时21点顾问、博物馆导览、购物搭配助手）展示了系统能够无缝感知环境、推断用户意图，无需显式提示即可提供及时有用的帮助。

Conclusion: AI4Service范式将AI从被动工具转变为主动适应伴侣，Alpha-Service框架为实现这一愿景提供了可行路径。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IP-Merging是一种无需调优的方法，通过识别多模态大语言模型(MLLM)和数学推理大语言模型中的关键推理相关参数，将其投影到MLLM的子空间进行融合，从而直接提升MLLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型(MLLM)的数学推理能力落后于纯文本大语言模型(LLM)，研究者希望探索能否在不进行调优的情况下，让MLLM直接从现成的数学LLM中吸收数学推理能力。

Method: 提出IP-Merging方法：1)识别MLLM和数学LLM中的推理相关参数；2)将这些参数投影到MLLM的子空间以保持对齐；3)在子空间中合并参数。该方法无需调优，直接调整参数。

Result: 大量实验表明，IP-Merging方法能够在不损害MLLM其他能力的前提下，直接从数学LLM中增强MLLM的数学推理能力。

Conclusion: IP-Merging通过识别关键推理层并缓解参数空间差距，成功实现了MLLM从数学LLM中直接吸收数学推理能力，是一种有效的免调优方法。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

TL;DR: Hi-Agent是一个可训练的分层视觉语言代理，用于移动设备控制，通过高层推理模型和低层动作模型的联合优化，在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的移动设备控制方法大多依赖直接的状态到动作映射，缺乏结构化推理和规划，导致在新任务或未见UI布局上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出分层架构：高层推理模型和低层动作模型联合优化。将多步决策重新表述为单步子目标序列，并提出前瞻优势函数，利用低层模型的执行反馈指导高层优化，缓解长时任务中的路径爆炸问题。

Result: 在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于提示式（AppAgent: 17.7%）、监督式（Filtered BC: 54.5%）和强化学习（DigiRL: 71.9%）方法。在ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中展示竞争性零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Hi-Agent通过分层设计和联合优化策略，在移动设备控制任务中实现了最先进的性能，并展示了良好的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的推理规划能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，通过端到端训练显著提升性能，在TravelPlanner基准上达到82.7%的最终通过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理和规划任务中表现不佳，多智能体系统虽然能提供更好的集体推理，但存在推理成本高、延迟长和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: 提出IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的能力集成到单一模型中，通过简单的端到端训练流程，使小规模模型获得结构化推理和规划能力。

Result: 使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型，在TravelPlanner基准上达到82.7%的最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功地将多智能体系统的优势集成到单一模型中，显著提升了推理规划能力，同时降低了模型规模和推理成本。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种转换方法，用于消除PDDL公理中派生谓词的负出现，证明即使允许负出现，表达能力仍等同于最小不动点逻辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDDL标准限制公理体中谓词的负出现只能用于直接由动作设置的谓词，而文献中常偏离此限制仅要求公理集可分层。本文旨在证明这两种变体表达相同查询的能力。

Method: 提出相应的转换方法，将包含派生谓词负出现的公理转换为等价形式，消除这种负出现。

Result: 证明了PDDL公理即使允许派生谓词的负出现，其表达能力仍与最小不动点逻辑完全相同。

Conclusion: 通过提出的转换方法，可以消除派生谓词的负出现，表明PDDL公理的两种变体在表达能力上是等价的。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

Motivation: 联邦学习在去中心化数据训练模型方面具有强大潜力，但设计和部署鲁棒系统的复杂性阻碍了其发展。选择和调整策略以应对数据异构性和系统约束等挑战已成为关键瓶颈。

Method: Helmsman通过三个协作阶段实现：1）交互式人机协作规划制定研究计划；2）监督智能体团队进行模块化代码生成；3）在沙盒模拟环境中进行自主评估和优化的闭环过程。

Result: 在包含16个多样化任务的AgentFL-Bench基准测试中，Helmsman生成的解决方案与手工设计的基线方法具有竞争力，且往往表现更优。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向复杂去中心化AI系统自动化工程迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

Motivation: 随着AI系统发展，用户期望增加，需要LLM与外部工具交互。但工具数量增加导致提示膨胀，带来高token成本、延迟增加和任务成功率下降的问题。

Method: 构建层次化工具分类学，基于用户提示和分类结构选择最相关工具，减少不必要工具包含在提示中。

Result: JSPLIT显著减少提示大小，在工具数量大幅增加时甚至提高工具选择准确性，降低成本的同时改善高复杂度环境中的任务成功率。

Conclusion: JSPLIT框架有效解决了MCP工具使用中的提示膨胀问题，通过智能工具选择在降低成本的同时保持甚至提升代理性能。

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

Method: 采用开放式实验设置，增强预训练LLM代理的任务生成能力、知识积累功能和环境交互能力，并进行定性研究。

Result: 增强后的代理能够可靠执行复杂多步指令、跨运行存储和重用信息、自主提出和解决任务，但对提示设计敏感、容易生成重复任务、无法形成自我表征。

Conclusion: 研究展示了将预训练LLM适应开放性的前景和当前局限，指出了未来在记忆管理、高效探索和追求抽象长期目标方面的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ColorBench，一个图结构基准测试框架，用于评估移动设备代理在复杂长程任务中的表现，解决了现有评估方法只能验证单一预设路径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前移动代理评估标准存在局限：离线静态基准只能验证单一"黄金路径"，而在线动态测试受限于真实设备的复杂性和不可重现性。需要一种能全面评估代理能力的新方法。

Method: 开发了图结构基准测试框架，通过建模真实设备交互中的有限状态，实现动态行为的静态模拟。构建了ColorBench基准，包含175个任务（74个单应用、101个跨应用），平均长度超过13步，每个任务包含至少两条正确路径和若干典型错误路径。

Result: 通过在各种基线模型上评估ColorBench，发现了现有模型的局限性，并基于实验结果提出了改进方向和可行的技术路径，以增强代理在复杂长程问题上的性能。

Conclusion: ColorBench框架能够有效评估移动代理的多路径解决能力，支持子任务完成率统计和原子级能力分析，为移动自动化领域提供了更全面的评估标准。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Rose-Frame框架，用于诊断人机交互中的认知和认识论漂移，通过三个维度（地图vs领土、直觉vs理性、冲突vs确认）来识别LLM的局限性，强调将AI对齐重新定义为认知治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然流畅且情感共鸣强，但基于统计预测而非有根据的推理，存在幻觉风险，可能产生听起来令人信服但缺乏事实有效性的回答。

Method: 引入Rose-Frame三维框架：地图vs领土（区分现实表征与现实本身）、直觉vs理性（基于双过程理论区分快速情感判断与缓慢反思思维）、冲突vs确认（检验观点是通过批判性测试还是简单相互验证）。

Result: Rose-Frame不试图用更多数据或规则修复LLM，而是提供反思工具，使模型局限性和用户假设可见，实现更透明和批判性意识强的AI部署。

Conclusion: 将AI对齐重新定义为认知治理：无论是人类还是人工智能的直觉，都必须受人类理性的治理。只有通过嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督，才能将机器的流畅性与人类的理解对齐。

communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

*Sara Altamirano,Arjan Vreeken,Sennay Ghebreab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统回顾了2021-2025年荷兰公共卫生机器学习研究中算法偏见的识别、讨论和报告情况，开发了RABAT评估工具，并提出了ACAR四阶段公平性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在公共卫生领域有巨大潜力，但如果不系统关注算法偏见，可能会无意中加剧现有的健康不平等。

Method: 开发了RABAT评估工具，整合了Cochrane偏倚风险、PROBAST和微软负责任AI检查表的元素，应用于35篇同行评审研究。

Result: 分析显示普遍存在差距：虽然数据抽样和缺失数据处理记录良好，但大多数研究缺乏明确的公平性框架、亚组分析和潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 提出了ACAR四阶段公平性框架和可操作建议，帮助公共卫生ML从业者系统考虑算法偏见，确保算法创新促进而非损害健康公平。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索系统无法在网络安全威胁、行为和防御之间进行清晰可逆的推理，需要一种能够将自然语言查询与结构化知识图谱推理相结合的系统。

Method: 集成路径规划模型预测文本到逻辑关系链，图执行器遍历TITAN本体图检索事实答案和证据，基于MITRE构建类型化双向图。

Result: 创建了包含88209个示例的TITAN数据集，实证评估显示模型能生成语法有效且语义连贯的推理路径，可在底层图上确定性执行。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询与结构化知识图谱推理的有效集成，为网络安全威胁情报分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统以人类为中心的AI伦理方法存在局限，需要发展不预设人类道德直觉的、能够适应动态多智能体环境的伦理框架。

Method: 提出神经符号架构，结合主动推理和符号推理，让智能体在动态多智能体环境中最小化全局期望自由能量，从而产生伦理行为。

Result: 通过伦理资源分配的案例研究，展示了NAEL能够动态平衡自我保存、认知学习和集体福利。

Conclusion: NAEL框架能够产生情境敏感、自适应和关系性的伦理行为，克服了现有伦理模型的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

Motivation: COUP算法配置方法虽然具有理论保证，但实际性能表现不佳。本文旨在弥补这一差距，使基于效用的算法配置方法在实用性能上能与广泛使用的启发式方法竞争。

Method: 提出了一系列对COUP的改进措施，在不降低理论保证的前提下提升其经验性能，并通过实验验证这些改进的效果。

Conclusion: 通过本文的改进，基于效用的算法配置方法达到了实用化水平，同时保持了理论保证，为算法选择问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

TL;DR: 提出PAVE方法，通过知识感知子空间净化任务向量，消除任务向量中的冗余成分，提升模型融合性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法中，任务向量包含任务无关的冗余信息，导致融合模型性能显著下降，而现有随机丢弃参数的方法缺乏知识感知

Method: 使用任务训练样本获取协方差矩阵，通过上下文导向的奇异值分解识别知识相关权重成分，在知识感知子空间中分离任务相关和冗余成分，并引入谱秩分配策略实现公平剪枝

Result: PAVE作为即插即用方案，在多种任务向量融合方法、任务和模型架构中均能有效提升性能

Conclusion: PAVE方法能有效净化任务向量中的冗余成分，显著提升模型融合性能，具有广泛的适用性

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

TL;DR: CoAST是一个用于下一个兴趣点推荐的框架，通过自然语言接口整合世界知识、时空轨迹模式和用户信息，采用持续预训练和认知对齐两阶段方法提升推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要基于非结构化文本预训练，缺乏对结构化地理实体和序列移动模式的理解，且工业级POI推荐需要整合世界知识和人类认知对齐（如季节、天气、节假日、用户画像等）来提升用户体验和推荐效果。

Method: CoAST框架包含两个阶段：(1) 推荐知识获取：在脱敏用户的丰富时空轨迹数据上进行持续预训练；(2) 认知对齐：通过监督微调和强化学习阶段，使用丰富训练数据将认知判断与人类偏好对齐。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的离线实验和AMAP App首页"猜你去哪"功能中的在线实验证明了CoAST的有效性。

Conclusion: CoAST通过自然语言接口成功整合了世界知识、时空轨迹模式和认知信息，显著提升了下一个兴趣点推荐的性能。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合细粒度波束搜索和过程奖励模型ToolPRM的推理扩展框架，用于提升LLM在结构化输出（如函数调用）任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理扩展研究主要关注非结构化输出生成任务，而在结构化输出（如函数调用）方面的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建了首个细粒度函数调用过程监督数据集，使用函数掩码技术自动标注步骤级奖励，训练ToolPRM过程奖励模型来评分单个函数调用的内部步骤。

Result: ToolPRM在预测准确性上优于粗粒度和结果奖励模型，推理扩展技术结合ToolPRM显著提升了骨干模型在各种函数调用任务和基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了将推理扩展技术应用于结构化输出的关键原则："多探索少保留"，这是由结构化函数调用生成的不可恢复性特征决定的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

TL;DR: 提出SimKO方法解决RLVR中的过度集中问题，通过不对称设计提升探索能力，改善pass@K性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在系统性偏向利用而非探索的问题，表现为pass@1提升但pass@K下降，需要理解并解决这种概率过度集中现象

Method: 分析RLVR训练动态，发现词汇候选概率过度集中现象，提出SimKO方法：对已验证正确响应提升top-K候选概率，对错误响应惩罚top-1候选，特别在高熵token上应用

Result: 在各种数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，SimKO在广泛的K值范围内持续获得更高的pass@K性能

Conclusion: SimKO通过缓解概率过度集中问题有效提升RLVR的探索能力，为改进RLVR提供了一种简单有效的方法

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Datalake Agent是一个基于LLM的代理系统，通过交互式循环减少NL2SQL任务中的元信息使用，显著降低token消耗和处理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL2SQL方法需要处理大量数据库元信息，导致提示过长、token消耗大、处理成本高。

Method: 采用代理式交互循环，在推理框架中让LLM选择性请求必要信息，而不是一次性使用所有元信息。

Result: 在23个数据库100个表问答任务上评估，token使用减少高达87%，成本大幅降低，同时保持竞争力性能。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent通过智能信息选择机制，在保证性能的同时显著降低了NL2SQL任务的成本。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

TL;DR: 提出了RoboGPT-R1，一个用于具身规划的两阶段微调框架，结合监督学习和强化学习来提升机器人在复杂环境中的长视野操作任务推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在规划任务中取得了一定成功，但在复杂真实世界环境中执行长视野操作任务时仍面临挑战，主要受限于常识和推理能力的不足。

Method: 采用两阶段微调框架：监督训练通过专家序列获取基础知识，随后使用强化学习解决模型在视觉空间理解和推理方面的不足。设计了基于规则的奖励函数，同时考虑长视野性能和动作约束。

Result: 在EmbodiedBench基准测试中，基于Qwen2.5-VL-3B训练得到的推理模型显著优于更大规模的GPT-4o-mini模型21.33%，并超过其他基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B的工作20.33%。

Conclusion: RoboGPT-R1框架通过结合监督学习和强化学习，有效提升了具身代理在复杂环境中的推理能力，特别是在长视野操作任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

*Ben Elder,Evelyn Duesterwald,Vinod Muthusamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting是一种后处理方法，通过提高LLM对提示指令的遵循率来增强其可靠性，在包含2-10条指令的情况下可将遵循率提升4-7个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发人员通常通过修改提示来影响LLM行为，但仅添加更多指令无法保证它们会被遵循，需要一种方法来提高指令遵循的可靠性。

Method: 提出Instruction Boosting作为后处理方法，并引入SCALEDIF基准测试集，该测试集每个数据样本最多包含10条指令。还开发了定量冲突评分工具来分析指令间的冲突。

Result: Instruction Boosting将指令遵循率提高了最多7个百分点（2条指令）和4个百分点（10条指令）。分析发现性能下降的重要原因是随着指令数量增加，指令间的紧张和冲突程度增加。

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting能有效提高LLM对提示指令的遵循可靠性，冲突评分工具可为开发人员提供关于额外提示指令对模型性能影响的反馈。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和科学发现中取得进展，但搜索效果取决于如何将领域先验编码为操作结构化的假设空间。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入输出的模糊关系算子，通过安全包络约束智能体；使用单延续参数加权所有可达路径，求和得到覆盖生成函数；提供可测试推断并通过多数投票实例验证。

Result: 该理论提供了可操作的语言和工具来衡量智能体及其搜索空间，为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供了系统的形式描述。

Conclusion: 提出的形式理论为LLM辅助的迭代搜索提供了工作语言和操作工具，能够系统地描述和测量基于领域先验的搜索过程。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

*Wen-Kwang Tsao,Yao-Ching Yu,Chien-Ming Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需标注数据或模型权重更新的强化学习代理，通过识别模糊字段映射、生成针对性网络搜索查询和应用置信度奖励来迭代改进企业智能平台中的第三方日志模式映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业智能平台需要集成来自众多第三方供应商的日志，但供应商文档在测试时往往不可用、不匹配、格式差或不完整，导致模式映射困难。

Method: 使用强化学习代理：1)识别模糊字段映射尝试；2)生成针对性网络搜索查询收集外部证据；3)应用基于置信度的奖励迭代优化映射。

Result: 在将Microsoft Defender for Endpoint日志转换为通用模式的任务中，该方法将映射准确率从56.4%(仅LLM)提升到72.73%(RAG)再到93.94%(100次迭代)，同时将需要专家审查的低置信度映射减少了85%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种证据驱动、透明的解决方案，为更鲁棒、可问责、可扩展、高效、灵活、适应性强和协作的解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Conclusion: 预算感知的判别式验证不仅是对自一致性的免费升级，而且是比昂贵生成式技术更有效和高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Conclusion: 本研究为多模态抑郁症检测的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将康德的纯粹理性批判重新解释为反馈稳定性理论，提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk来诊断推理系统的过度自信问题，并在线性高斯模拟和LLMs中验证了该指标的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将康德的理性自我限制理论与反馈控制理论联系起来，为诊断和减少推理系统的过度自信提供理论框架。

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk（结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大），在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行验证。

Result: 在线性高斯模拟中，更高的H-Risk预测了过度自信错误；在LLMs中，脆弱的内部动态与校准错误和幻觉相关，批判式提示对校准和幻觉的影响不一。

Conclusion: 为康德式自我限制和反馈控制之间建立了结构性桥梁，为诊断和选择性减少推理系统中的过度自信提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GroundedPRM是一个基于树搜索和外部工具验证的自动过程监督框架，通过MCTS构建结构化推理路径，使用外部工具验证中间步骤，结合步骤级验证和全局评估，在少量数据上实现高质量的过程奖励建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型(PRMs)面临三大挑战：噪声奖励、低事实保真度以及与步骤级推理目标不对齐。这些问题源于依赖昂贵的人工标注、易产生幻觉的LLM自评估，以及仅从最终结果推断步骤质量的蒙特卡洛估计方法。

Method: 1) 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)构建结构化推理路径以减少奖励噪声；2) 通过外部工具验证每个中间步骤，提供基于执行的正确性信号；3) 设计混合奖励聚合机制，融合工具验证和MCTS反馈；4) 将奖励信号格式化为增强推理的生成结构。

Result: 仅使用4万个自动标注样本(最佳PRM的10%数据量)，在ProcessBench上实现了高达26%的相对性能提升。在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中，甚至超越了基于人工标注监督训练的PRMs。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM为高质量过程级推理提供了一个可扩展且可验证的路径，通过结合树搜索指导和保真度感知的自动过程监督，有效解决了现有PRMs的核心局限性。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

Result: 当前开源模型在空间推理、策略组装和指令遵循等关键能力上表现不足，但强化学习微调显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: 机器设计任务揭示了LLMs在语言、机器设计和物理推理交叉领域面临的挑战，强化学习是提升这些能力的可行路径。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Method: 基于鞅表示理论，设计神经网络架构DeepMartingale，通过深度学习近似最优停止问题的对偶上界。

Result: 证明了DeepMartingale的上界收敛性，并建立了表达能力理论：网络规模与维度无关，可任意精度逼近真实值函数。数值实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepMartingale为高维最优停止问题提供了高效的计算框架，突破了维度诅咒的限制，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Using a martingale representation, we introduce a novel deep-learning
approach, which we call DeepMartingale, to study the duality of
discrete-monitoring optimal stopping problems in continuous time. This approach
provides a tight upper bound for the primal value function, even in
high-dimensional settings. We prove that the upper bound derived from
DeepMartingale converges under very mild assumptions. Even more importantly, we
establish the expressivity of DeepMartingale: it approximates the true value
function within any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$ under our architectural
design of neural networks whose size is bounded by
$\tilde{c}\,D^{\tilde{q}}\varepsilon^{-\tilde{r}}$, where the constants
$\tilde{c}, \tilde{q}, \tilde{r}$ are independent of the dimension $D$ and the
accuracy $\varepsilon$. This guarantees that DeepMartingale does not suffer
from the curse of dimensionality. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
practical effectiveness of DeepMartingale, confirming its convergence,
expressivity, and stability.

Motivation: 研究肾脏交换项目中HLA相容性不同范式对移植效果和种族公平性的影响，旨在解决从抗原向等位基因和表位范式转变过程中可能加剧的种族不平等问题。

Method: 使用三种HLA相容性范式（抗原、等位基因、表位）分析肾脏交换项目的效果和公平性，并开发基于公平性加权的优化模型来缓解种族不平等。

Result: 研究发现从抗原向等位基因和表位范式的转变可能扩大种族不平等，但提出的公平性加权优化模型能够在所有三种范式中缓解种族不平等，同时不牺牲移植机会。

Conclusion: 通过公平性加权的优化方法可以有效解决肾脏交换项目中HLA相容性范式转变带来的种族不平等问题，在维持移植机会的同时促进公平性。

Abstract: Kidney Exchange Programs (KEPs) promote access to living donor trans-
plantation for patients suffering from end stage renal disease. The HLA
compatibility between transplant recipients and donors plays an important role
when solving the matching problems occuring in KEPs. Compatibility defines the
feasible solution space and often occurs in a weighted form in the objective
function. Recently, the paradigms used to express HLA com- patibility have
advanced substantially from antigens to alleles and eplets. We show how KEP
effectiveness and equity vary with these three paradigms. The equity analysis
focuses on ethnic inequities and the result confirm that moving from antigen to
allele and eplet paradigms may enlarge inequities. We present new optimization
models based on equity weighting that rem- edy ethnic inequities for all three
paradigms without sacrificing access to transplant.

Conclusion: MiSSOC是通过代理建模解决复杂MINLP问题的有效方法，特别是与SC-MINLP算法结合使用时效果显著。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making processes rely on solving mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. However, finding high-quality solutions
to MINLPs is often computationally demanding. This has motivated the
development of specialized algorithms that take advantage of the structure of
some MINLPs to improve their tractability. In this work, we propose the
Mixed-integer Smoothing Surrogate Optimization with Constraints (MiSSOC)
approach, a novel optimization algorithm that builds and solves surrogate
problems for complex MINLPs which are more tractable in practice. MiSSOC
integrates statistical modeling into mathematical optimization by approximating
complex functions in an MINLP using smooth additive regression models with
$B-$splines. Expert knowledge can be incorporated into the building phase of
the approximating functions through shape constraints related to sign (or
bounds), monotonicity and convexity over the observed domain. Thus, MiSSOC
fills a gap in the literature by building surrogates that are both data-driven
and knowledge-driven. The surrogate problem is formulated by replacing the
original complex functions with their approximations. The proposed MiSSOC
algorithm is evaluated through a set of experiments, including benchmark
instances and a real-world case study. MiSSOC is tested with different
state-of-the-art solvers and with the tailored Sequential Convex MINLP
(SC-MINLP) algorithm. The latter exploits the separable structure of the
surrogate functions, which results from the approximating functions being sums
of piecewise univariate polynomials. MiSSOC is benchmarked against solving the
original MINLPs directly. The results show that MiSSOC is an effective approach
for addressing complex MINLPs through surrogate modeling, particularly when
used in combination with the SC-MINLP algorithm.

Abstract: Natural disasters threaten the resilience of power systems, causing
widespread power outages that disrupt critical loads (e.g., hospitals) and
endanger public safety. Compared to the conventional restoration methods that
often have long response times, leveraging government-controlled electric
school buses (ESBs) with large battery capacity and deployment readiness offers
a promising solution for faster power restoration to critical loads during
disasters while traditional maintenance is underway. Therefore, we study the
problem of routing and scheduling a heterogeneous fleet of ESBs to satisfy the
energy demand of critical isolated loads around disasters addressing the
following practical aspects: combined transportation and energy scheduling of
ESBs, multiple back-and-forth trips of ESBs between isolated loads and charging
stations, and spatial-wise coupling among multiple ESB routes. We propose an
efficient mixed-integer programming model for routing and scheduling ESBs,
accounting for the practical aspects, to minimize the total restoration cost
over a planning horizon. We develop an efficient exact branch-and-price (B&P)
algorithm and a customized heuristic B&P algorithm integrating dynamic
programming and labeling algorithms. Numerical results based on a real case
study of San Antonio disaster shelters and critical facilities demonstrate that
our proposed exact B&P and heuristic B&P algorithms are computationally 121 and
335 times faster, respectively, than Gurobi. Using network sparsity to
incorporate the limitation in shelter-ESB type compatibility in the model
demonstrates that the total restoration cost increases, on average, by 207% as
the network becomes fully sparse compared to fully connected. The capacity
utilization metric reflects that the proposed practical ESB routing and
scheduling enables an ESB to meet the energy demand 4.5 times its effective
usable capacity.

Abstract: Simulation-based optimization of complex systems over discrete decision
spaces is a challenging computational problem. Specifically, discrete decision
spaces lead to a combinatorial explosion of possible alternatives, making it
computationally prohibitive to perform simulations for all possible
combinations. In this work, we present a new approach to handle these issues by
transforming/projecting the discrete decision space into a continuous latent
space using a probabilistic model know as Variational AutoEncoders. The
transformation of the decision space facilitates the implementation of Bayesian
optimization (BO), which is an efficient approach that strategically navigates
the space to reduce the number of expensive simulations. Here, the key
observation is that points in the latent space correspond to decisions in the
original mixed-discrete space, but the latent space is much easier to navigate
using BO. We illustrate the benefits of our approach through a couple of case
studies that aim to design complex distillation systems: the recovery of
caprylic acid from water by liquid-liquid extraction and the separation of an
azeotropic mixture using a thermally couple column know as extractive dividing
wall column.

Abstract: Column generation and branch-and-price are leading methods for large-scale
exact optimization. Column generation iterates between solving a master problem
and a pricing problem. The master problem is a linear program, which can be
solved using a generic solver. The pricing problem is highly dependent on the
application but is usually discrete. Due to the difficulty of discrete
optimization, high-performance column generation often relies on a custom
pricing algorithm built specifically to exploit the problem's structure. This
bespoke nature of the pricing solver prevents the reuse of components for other
applications. We show that domain-independent dynamic programming, a software
package for modeling and solving arbitrary dynamic programs, can be used as a
generic pricing solver. We develop basic implementations of branch-and-price
with pricing by domain-independent dynamic programming and show that they
outperform a world-leading solver on static mixed integer programming
formulations for seven problem classes.

Abstract: Renewable generators must commit to day-ahead market bids despite uncertainty
in both production and real-time prices. While forecasts provide valuable
guidance, rare and unpredictable extreme events (so-called black swans) can
cause substantial financial losses. This paper models the nomination problem as
an instance of optimal transport-based distributionally robust optimization
(OT-DRO), a principled framework that balances risk and performance by
accounting not only for the severity of deviations but also for their
likelihood. The resulting formulation yields a tractable, data-driven strategy
that remains competitive under normal conditions while providing effective
protection against extreme price spikes. Using four years of Finnish wind farm
and market data, we demonstrate that OT-DRO consistently outperforms
forecast-based nominations and significantly mitigates losses during black swan
events.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种归一化随机梯度上升方法用于张量PCA问题，在无需全局初始化的情况下，仅需Ω(d^⌈k/2⌉)样本即可恢复信号，打破了之前认为需要Ω(d^{k-1})样本的猜想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决张量主成分分析问题，特别是打破之前关于随机梯度方法需要大量样本的猜想，证明过参数化可以改善统计性能。

Method: 提出归一化随机梯度上升方法，采用过参数化策略，无需全局初始化步骤。

Result: 算法在Nλ² ≥ Ω(d^⌈k/2⌉)条件下成功恢复信号v*，对于偶数k，该阈值与计算约束下的最优阈值一致。

Conclusion: 过参数化的随机梯度方法在早期学习阶段建立优化优势，并实现强泛化保证，首次证明过参数化相对于精确参数化能改善统计性能。

Abstract: We study the Order-$k$ ($k \geq 4$) spiked tensor model for the tensor
principal component analysis (PCA) problem: given $N$ i.i.d. observations of a
$k$-th order tensor generated from the model $\mathbf{T} = \lambda \cdot
v_*^{\otimes k} + \mathbf{E}$, where $\lambda > 0$ is the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), $v_*$ is a unit vector, and $\mathbf{E}$ is a random noise tensor, the
goal is to recover the planted vector $v_*$.
  We propose a normalized stochastic gradient ascent (NSGA) method with
overparameterization for solving the tensor PCA problem. Without any global (or
spectral) initialization step, the proposed algorithm successfully recovers the
signal $v_*$ when $N\lambda^2 \geq \widetilde{\Omega}(d^{\lceil k/2 \rceil})$,
thereby breaking the previous conjecture that (stochastic) gradient methods
require at least $\Omega(d^{k-1})$ samples for recovery. For even $k$, the
$\widetilde{\Omega}(d^{k/2})$ threshold coincides with the optimal threshold
under computational constraints, attained by sum-of-squares relaxations and
related algorithms. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the
overparameterized stochastic gradient method not only establishes a significant
initial optimization advantage during the early learning phase but also
achieves strong generalization guarantees. This work provides the first
evidence that overparameterization improves statistical performance relative to
exact parameterization that is solved via standard continuous optimization.

### [313] [Recursive Target Body Approach for Low-Thrust Multiple Gravity-Assist Sequence Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14402)
*Sean Cowan,Ron Noomen*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 开发了一种名为递归目标体方法(RTBA)的新型优化方法，用于自动化设计多重力辅助(MGA)低推力行星转移轨道，结合树搜索方法和并行化技术，显著提高了优化效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在空间任务初步设计阶段，MGA序列的组合复杂性非常高，现有优化方法需要丰富经验且耗时数天，因此需要自动化且高效的优化方法。

Method: 采用递归目标体方法(RTBA)，结合Hodographic-shaping低推力轨迹表示和树搜索方法，通过递归评估后续重力辅助目标的最优性逐步构建最优MGA序列，并使用广义岛模型(GIM)进行并行化。

Result: 在地球-木星转移任务中，RTBA在21.5小时内找到了最优的EMJ转移轨道，ΔV为15.4 km/s，通过调优显著提高了MGA轨迹质量，发现了一组高适应度的MGA序列。

Conclusion: RTBA可以自动可靠地用于低推力MGA轨迹的初步优化，为后续高精度方法提供可靠输入。

Abstract: This work aims to automate the design of Multiple Gravity-Assist (MGA)
transfers between planets using low-thrust propulsion. In particular, during
the preliminary design phase of space missions, the combinatorial complexity of
MGA sequencing is very large, and current optimization approaches require
extensive experience and can take many days to simulate. Therefore, a novel
optimization approach is developed here -- called the Recursive Target Body
Approach (RTBA) -- that uses the hodographic-shaping low-thrust trajectory
representation together with a unique combination of tree-search methods to
automate the optimization of MGA sequences. The approach gradually constructs
the optimal MGA sequence by recursively evaluating the optimality of subsequent
gravity-assist targets. Another significant contribution to the novelty of this
work is the use of parallelization in an original way involving the Generalized
Island Model (GIM) that enables the use of new figures of merit to further
increase the robustness and accelerate the convergence. An Earth-Jupiter
transfer with a maximum of three gravity assists is considered as a reference
problem. The RTBA takes 21.5 hours to find an EMJ transfer with 15.4 km/s
$\Delta V$ to be the optimum. Extensive tuning improved the quality of the MGA
trajectories substantially, and as a result a robust low-thrust trajectory
optimization could be ensured. A distinct group of highly fit MGA sequences is
consistently found that can be passed on to a higher-fidelity method. In
conclusion, the RTBA can automatically and reliably be used for the preliminary
optimization of low-thrust MGA trajectories.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出首个能够对含储能约束的电力系统模型进行精确时间序列聚合的方法，利用有效约束集和对偶信息，相比现有方法能保证解精度且无需迭代确定代表性时段数量。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列聚合方法通常无法保证解精度，或需要迭代过程来确定代表性时段数量，这限制了其在含储能约束的电力系统优化中的应用。

Conclusion: 该方法在电力系统优化中实现了精确的时间序列聚合，为含储能约束的可再生能源调度提供了高效的计算框架。

Abstract: Time series aggregation (TSA) methods aim to construct temporally aggregated
optimization models that accurately represent the output space of their
full-scale counterparts while using a significantly reduced dimensionality in
the input space. This paper presents the first approach that achieves an exact
TSA of a full-scale power system model -- even in the presence of energy
storage time-coupling constraints -- by leveraging active constraint sets and
dual information. This advances the state of the art beyond existing TSA
approaches, which typically cannot guarantee solution accuracy or rely on
iterative procedures to determine the required number of representative
periods. To bridge the gap between our theoretical analysis and their practical
application, we employ machine learning approaches, i.e., classification and
clustering, to inform TSA in models that co-schedule variable renewable energy
sources and energy storage. Numerical results demonstrate substantially
improved computational performance relative to the full-scale model, while
maintaining high solution accuracy.

Motivation: 传统方法通常只对状态变量进行降维，但最优控制问题中控制变量同样重要。论文旨在开发同时降低控制和状态变量维度的更有效方法，以提高计算效率。

Method: 通过一阶最优性条件推导出控制-状态联合降维结构，提出自适应算法并证明其收敛性。利用后验误差界来指导降维过程。

Result: 证明了控制-状态联合降维问题与原状态降维问题具有相同的最小化解，提供了最优控制的后验误差上下界和最优函数值误差表示。

Conclusion: 数值实验表明控制-状态联合降维方法优于单纯的状态降维方法，自适应算法能有效求解控制问题并保证收敛。

Abstract: We consider linear model reduction in both the control and state variables
for unconstrained linear-quadratic optimal control problems subject to
time-varying parabolic PDEs. The first-order optimality condition for a
state-space reduced model naturally leads to a reduced structure of the optimal
control. Thus, we consider a control- and state-reduced problem that admits the
same minimizer as the solely state-reduced problem. Lower and upper \emph{a
posteriori} error bounds for the optimal control and a representation for the
error in the optimal function value are provided. These bounds are used in an
adaptive algorithm to solve the control problem. We prove its convergence and
numerically demonstrate the advantage of combined control and state space
reduction.

Motivation: 扩展流匹配方法到系统集成场景，解决参数不确定性导致的非马尔可夫插值问题，实现分布可控性。

Method: 通过系统参数平均引入记忆效应，推导Volterra型控制的条件期望作为控制律，针对随机情况使用循环网络，确定性情况使用前馈网络，并建立确定性样本配对。

Result: 得到了随机情况下历史依赖性的重要性，以及确定性情况下通过时间变化增益实现集成传输，需要先建立确定性样本配对才能实现完整目标分布。

Conclusion: 成功将流匹配扩展到系统集成，区分了随机和确定性情况的不同实现策略，随机情况需要记忆处理，确定性情况可通过低维回归学习时间变化增益。

Abstract: We extend flow matching to ensembles of linear systems in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. Averaging over system parameters induces memory
leading to a non-Markovian interpolation problem for the stochastic case. In
this setting, a control law that achieves the distributional controllability is
characterized as the conditional expectation of a Volterra-type control. This
conditional expectation in the stochastic settings motivates an open-loop
characterization in the noiseless-deterministic setting. Explicit forms of the
conditional expectations are derived for special cases of the given
distributions and a practical numerical procedure is presented to approximate
the control inputs. A by-product of our analysis is a numerical split between
the two regimes. For the stochastic case, history dependence is essential and
we implement the conditional expectation with a recurrent network trained using
independent sampling. For the deterministic case, the flow is memoryless and a
feedforward network learns a time-varying gain that transports the ensemble. We
show that to realize the full target distribution in this deterministic
setting, one must first establish a deterministic sample pairing (e.g.,
optimal-transport or Schrodinger-bridge coupling), after which learning reduces
to a low-dimensional regression in time.

Result: 数值测试表明该框架在噪声脑部分割中效果显著，在定性和定量评估上都优于类似方法

Conclusion: 所提出的三步框架能有效处理MRI图像中的噪声和偏置问题，提高分割准确性

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is essential for noninvasive generation of
high-quality images of human tissues. Accurate segmentation of MRI data is
critical for medical applications like brain anatomy analysis and disease
detection. However, challenges such as intensity inhomogeneity, noise, and
artifacts complicate this process. To address these issues, we propose a
three-step framework exploiting the idea of Cartoon-Texture evolution to
produce a denoised and debiased MR image. The first step involves identifying
statistical information about the nature of the noise using a suitable image
decomposition. In the second step, a multiplicative intrinsic component model
is applied to a smother version of the image, simultaneously reconstructing the
bias and removing noise using noise information from the previous step. At the
final step, standard clustering techniques are used to create an accurate
segmentation. Additionally, we present a convergence analysis of the ADMM
scheme for solving the nonlinear optimization problem with multiaffine
constraints resulting from the second step. Numerical tests demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework, especially in noisy brain segmentation, both
from a qualitative and a quantitative viewpoint, compared to similar methods.

Abstract: Modeling heterogeneous and multi-lane traffic flow is essential for
understanding and controlling complex transportation systems. In this work, we
consider three vehicle populations: two classes of human-driven vehicles (cars
and trucks) and autonomous vehicles, the latter characterized by controlled
acceleration. Compared to single-population models, multi-population modeling
poses greater challenges, primarily due to the increased number of parameters
required to describe lane-changing behavior and the added complexity in passing
to the mean-field limit. We model multi-lane traffic as a hybrid dynamical
system, combining continuous dynamics within each lane and discrete events
corresponding to lane-changing maneuvers. We then formulate and analyze the
optimal control problem associated with such hybrid systems from both
microscopic and mesoscopic perspectives. Using techniques from
$\Gamma$-convergence, we prove the existence of solutions to the optimal
control problem in the mean-field limit of a finite-dimensional hybrid system.
Finally, we present numerical simulations illustrating the impact of trucks on
overall traffic efficiency.

Result: 在温和假设下，算法被证明能全局收敛到帕累托临界点，实验结果显示与其他确定性和进化方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 广义约化雅可比方法成功处理了非线性约束多目标优化问题，避免了标量化，实现了全局收敛，为多目标优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In a recent work, we presented the reduced Jacobian method (RJM) as an
extension of Wolfe's reduced gradient method to multicriteria (multiobjective)
optimization problems dealing with linear constraints. This approach reveals
that using a reduction technique of the Jacobian matrix of the objective avoids
scalarization. In the present work, we intend to generalize RJM to handle
nonlinear constraints too. In fact, we propose a generalized reduced Jacobian
(GRJ) method that extends Abadie-Carpentier's approach for single-objective
programs. To this end, we adopt a global reduction strategy based on the
fundamental theorem of implicit functions. In this perspective, only a reduced
descent direction common to all the criteria is computed by solving a simple
convex program. After establishing an Armijo-type line search condition that
ensures feasibility, the resulting algorithm is shown to be globally
convergent, under mild assumptions, to a Pareto critical (KKT-stationary)
point. Finally, experimental results are presented, including comparisons with
other deterministic and evolutionary approaches.

Conclusion: 阐明了时间尺度分离和熵正则化在稳定性和收敛性中的相互作用及其影响。

Abstract: We prove the stability and global convergence of a coupled actor-critic
gradient flow for infinite-horizon and entropy-regularised Markov decision
processes (MDPs) in continuous state and action space with linear function
approximation under Q-function realisability. We consider a version of the
actor critic gradient flow where the critic is updated using temporal
difference (TD) learning while the policy is updated using a policy mirror
descent method on a separate timescale. We demonstrate stability and
exponential convergence of the actor critic flow to the optimal policy.
Finally, we address the interplay of the timescale separation and entropy
regularisation and its effect on stability and convergence.

Abstract: In many applications of mathematical optimization, one may wish to optimize
an objective function without access to its derivatives. These situations call
for derivative-free optimization (DFO) methods. Among the most successful
approaches in practice are model-based trust-region methods, such as those
pioneered by M.J.D Powell. While relatively complex to implement, these methods
are now available in standard scientific computing platforms, including MATLAB
and SciPy. However, theoretical analysis of their computational complexity lags
behind practice. In particular, it is important to bound the number of function
evaluations required to achieve a desired level of accuracy. In this paper we
systematically derive complexity bounds for classical model-based trust-region
methods and their modern variations. We establish, for the first time, that
these methods can have the same worst case complexity than any other known DFO
method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合帮助框架，将AI生成的提示与教师升级机制相结合，以在编程课程中提供可扩展的高质量反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程课程中及时高质量的反馈对有效学习至关重要，但大规模提供这种支持仍具挑战性。AI系统可扩展但可能不准确，教师有专业知识但时间有限。

Method: 开发混合帮助框架，集成AI生成的提示和升级机制，当AI支持不足时学生可请求教师反馈。在82名学生的数据科学编程课程中部署该工具。

Result: 在673个AI生成的提示中，22%被学生评为无帮助，其中只有11%升级到教师。教师反馈中约一半存在错误或不足。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一种实用的方法来扩展高质量支持，并为未来有效整合AI和人类在教育中的努力提供了参考。

Abstract: Timely and high-quality feedback is essential for effective learning in
programming courses; yet, providing such support at scale remains a challenge.
While AI-based systems offer scalable and immediate help, their responses can
occasionally be inaccurate or insufficient. Human instructors, in contrast, may
bring more valuable expertise but are limited in time and availability. To
address these limitations, we present a hybrid help framework that integrates
AI-generated hints with an escalation mechanism, allowing students to request
feedback from instructors when AI support falls short. This design leverages
the strengths of AI for scale and responsiveness while reserving instructor
effort for moments of greatest need. We deployed this tool in a data science
programming course with 82 students. We observe that out of the total 673
AI-generated hints, students rated 146 (22%) as unhelpful. Among those, only 16
(11%) of the cases were escalated to the instructors. A qualitative
investigation of instructor responses showed that those feedback instances were
incorrect or insufficient roughly half of the time. This finding suggests that
when AI support fails, even instructors with expertise may need to pay greater
attention to avoid making mistakes. We will publicly release the tool for
broader adoption and enable further studies in other classrooms. Our work
contributes a practical approach to scaling high-quality support and informs
future efforts to effectively integrate AI and humans in education.

Method: 使用Facebook公共页面和群组的帖子数据，分析粉红粘液网站的分享趋势及其母公司广告购买模式。

Abstract: Pink slime journalism is a practice where news outlets publish low-quality or
inflammatory partisan articles, claiming to be local news networks. This paper
examines the spread of pink slime sites on Facebook using public posts from
Pages and Groups. We evaluate the trends of sharing pink slime sites on
Facebook and patterns regarding the advertisements purchased by the parent
organizations of the pink slime news networks. Our analysis discovers that
while the number of pink slime posts on Facebook pages have decreased over the
years, advertising dollars have increased. The increase in advertising dollars
influences an increase in Facebook group posts. Further, the advertising
expenditure increases during election years, but contentious topics are still
discussed during non-election years. By illustrating the patterns and themes
from US election years of 2020, 2022, and 2024, this research offers insights
into potentially dangerous journalism tactics, and provides predictions for
future US Presidential Elections.

Abstract: The Indian judicial system faces a critical challenge with approximately 52
million pending cases, causing significant delays that impact socio-economic
stability. This study proposes a cloud-based software framework to classify and
prioritize court cases using algorithmic methods based on parameters such as
severity of crime committed, responsibility of parties involved, case filing
dates, previous hearing's data, priority level (e.g., Urgent, Medium, Ordinary)
provided as input, and relevant Indian Penal Code (IPC), Code of Criminal
Procedure (CrPC), and other legal sections (e.g., Hindu Marriage Act, Indian
Contract Act). Cases are initially entered by advocates on record or court
registrars, followed by automated hearing date allocation that balances fresh
and old cases while accounting for court holidays and leaves. The system
streamlines appellate processes by fetching data from historical case
databases. Our methodology integrates algorithmic prioritization, a robust
notification system, and judicial interaction, with features that allow judges
to view daily case counts and their details. Simulations demonstrate that the
system can process cases efficiently, with reliable notification delivery and
positive user satisfaction among judges and registrars. Future iterations will
incorporate advanced machine learning for dynamic prioritization, addressing
critical gaps in existing court case management systems to enhance efficiency
and reduce backlogs.
