Increasingly applied in last-mile delivery, this synchronization helps reduce completion time and operational costs. To improve its efficiency, various coordination modes between trucks and drones have been proposed. Each mode accommodates diverse operational constraints tailored to particular delivery requirements. In existing work, a slight change in the structural framework or operational characteristics could generate a totally different problem variant, which often requires the design of specialized algorithms. Consequently, under the requirement of maintaining structural validation and adapting to multiple operational features, this paper presents a unified three-phase solution framework based on the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun algorithm to solve a wide family of truck-and-drone routing problems. To validate its flexibility and effectiveness, we carry out numerical experiments on three problem variants: the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem (FSTSP), the Traveling Salesman Problem with Multiple Drones (TSP-mD), and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (VRP-D), benchmarking each against an effective algorithm. Computational results show that the framework can closely match optimal solutions on small-size instances and even improve the best-known solutions for several medium-size instances. Moreover, additional extensions are discussed to further highlight its versatility."}

Prior approaches for nonconvex minimax optimization often require (strong) concavity on the maximization part, or certain restrictive geometric assumptions on the joint objective to have guaranteed convergence. In contrast, our method only assumes weak convexity in the primal variable and the extended Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property, with exponent $θ\\in [0,1]$, in the dual variable, significantly broadening the class of tractable problems. To this end, we propose a variance reduced algorithm that provably handles this general setting and achieves an $\\varepsilon$-stationary solution with state-of-the-art sample complexity: in the smooth finite-sum setting, the sample complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{N}\\,\\varepsilon^{-\\max\\{4θ,2\\}}\\right)$, where $N$ is the number of total samples, and in the online smooth setting, it is $\\mathcal{O}\\Big(\\varepsilon^{-\\max\\{6θ,3\\}}\\Big)$.

The approach is illustrated via propensity score designs in stratified randomized experiments. Our theoretical results show that the empirical Bayes design achieves oracle-optimal performance as the number of prior studies grows, and characterize the rate at which regret vanishes. To illustrate the approach, we present two empirical applications--oncology drug trials and the Tennessee Project STAR experiment. Our framework connects the Bayesian meta-analysis literature to experimental design and provides practical guidance for researchers seeking to design more efficient experiments."}

Existing learning tools, such as simulators and visualisers, support understanding by exposing machine states. However, they often limit students to passive observation and provide few opportunities for meaningful interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce Playsemble, a gamified learning system that transforms assembly instructions into interactive, game-like tasks in which students control Pac-Man to collect items, avoid ghosts, and reach targets. Playsemble integrates a code editor, a CPU emulator, and visual debugging tools within a browser-based environment, allowing students to work offline without installation or configuration. It also provides immediate formative feedback enhanced by large language models. We deployed Playsemble in an undergraduate computer architecture course with 107 students. The course featured a sequence of assignments of increasing complexity, covering core concepts such as register and memory manipulation, control structures including loops and conditionals, and arithmetic operations. Our findings suggest that Playsemble promotes active experimentation, sustained engagement, and deeper conceptual understanding through meaningful game-based learning experiences."}

We develop Bayesian Parametric Portfolio Policies (BPPP), which place a prior on policy coefficients thereby correcting the decision rule. We derive a general result showing that the utility gap between PPP and BPPP is strictly positive and proportional to posterior parameter uncertainty and signal magnitude. Under a mean--variance approximation, this correction appears as an additional estimation-risk term in portfolio variance, implying that PPP overexposes when signals are strongest and when risk aversion is high. Empirically, in a high-dimensional setting with 242 signals and six factors over 1973--2023, BPPP delivers higher Sharpe ratios, substantially lower turnover, larger investor welfare, and lower tail risk, with advantages that increase monotonically in risk aversion and are strongest during crisis episodes."}

Across 50 evaluation scenarios, it maintains performance comparable to the original model and achieves the best results in 40 cases, outperforming common baselines such as layer freezing and external data mixing. Guided by these empirical findings, we further present a theoretical analysis suggesting that forgetting can partly stem from style-induced parameter drift, and that self-alignment through self-generated data provides an effective means to counteract this effect. Overall, our results indicate that self-augmentation offers a simple and effective mechanism for robust LLM adaptation without incurring catastrophic forgetting."}

Unlike approaches based on binary encoding, which require $N^2$ variables and penalty terms to enforce valid tour constraints, we adopt a permutation-based formulation with integer variables and use autoregressive sampling with masking to guarantee that every generated sample is a valid tour by construction. We also introduce a $k$-site MPS variant that learns distributions over $k$-grams (consecutive city subsequences) using a sliding window approach, enabling parameter-efficient modeling for larger instances. Experimental validation on TSPLIB benchmark instances with up to 52 cities demonstrates that TN-GEO can outperform classical heuristics including swap and 2-opt hill-climbing.

Their joint predictive structure at the population level remains incompletely characterized. Objectives: The study aims to identify multilevel predictors of overweight and obesity among U.S. adolescents and compare the predictive performance, calibration, and subgroup equity of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Data and Methods: We analyze 18,792 children aged 10-17 years from the 2021 National Survey of Children's Health. Overweight/obesity is defined using BMI categories. Predictors included diet, physical activity, sleep, parental stress, socioeconomic conditions, adverse experiences, and neighborhood characteristics. Models include logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, multilayer perceptron, and TabNet. Performance is evaluated using AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Brier score. Results: Discrimination range from 0.66 to 0.79. Logistic regression, gradient boosting, and MLP showed the most stable balance of discrimination and calibration. Boosting and deep learning modestly improve recall and F1 score. No model was uniformly superior. Performance disparities across race and poverty groups persist across algorithms. Conclusion: Increased model complexity yields limited gains over logistic regression. Predictors consistently span behavioral, household, and neighborhood domains. Persistent subgroup disparities indicate the need for improved data quality and equity-focused surveillance rather than greater algorithmic complexity."}

As a byproduct, our analysis furnishes a theoretical explanation for the gradient spiking phenomenon widely observed in deep learning, precisely characterizing the conditions under which training recovers from spikes or diverges.

In this work, we attribute the source of varying calibration parameters to the varying token-level sensitivity caused by a precision-dependent outlier migration phenomenon.Motivated by this observation, we propose \\texttt{MoBiQuant}, a novel Mixture-of-Bits quantization framework that adjusts weight precision for elastic LLM inference based on token sensitivity. Specifically, we propose the many-in-one recursive residual quantization that can iteratively reconstruct higher-precision weights and the token-aware router to dynamically select the number of residual bit slices.

Experimental results demonstrate that MoBiQuant exhibits strong elasticity, enabling it to match the performance of bit-specific calibrated PTQ on LLaMA3-8B without repeated calibration."}

Existing artificial intelligence approaches typically optimize individual components of phenotyping but do not operationalize the full clinical workflow of extracting features from clinical text, standardizing them to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, and prioritizing diagnostically informative HPO terms. We developed RARE-PHENIX, an end-to-end AI framework for rare disease phenotyping that integrates large language model-based phenotype extraction, ontology-grounded standardization to HPO terms, and supervised ranking of diagnostically informative phenotypes. We trained RARE-PHENIX using data from 2,671 patients across 11 Undiagnosed Diseases Network clinical sites, and externally validated it on 16,357 real-world clinical notes from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Using clinician-curated HPO terms as the gold standard, RARE-PHENIX consistently outperformed a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline (PhenoBERT) across ontology-based similarity and precision-recall-F1 metrics in end-to-end evaluation (i.e., ontology-based similarity of 0.70 vs. 0.58). Ablation analyses demonstrated performance improvements with the addition of each module in RARE-PHENIX (extraction, standardization, and prioritization), supporting the value of modeling the full clinical phenotyping workflow. By modeling phenotyping as a clinically aligned workflow rather than a single extraction task, RARE-PHENIX provides structured, ranked phenotypes that are more concordant with clinician curation and has the potential to support human-in-the-loop rare disease diagnosis in real-world settings."}

A central foundational contribution is the development of a new lifted positivity certificate: we demonstrate that piecewise polynomials positive over Archimedean basic semi-algebraic sets admit a structured system of sum-of-squares (SOS) representations. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed hierarchy achieves finite convergence under suitable conditions when the defining polynomials are convex. The practical utility and versatility of this approach are demonstrated via numerical experiments in revenue estimation and portfolio optimization."}

A common strategy is to train a reflection model as a filter to intercept false alerts with labelled data collected from user verification feedback. However, a key challenge is the noisy nature of such data as it is often collected in production environments. As cleaning noise via manual annotation incurs high costs, this paper proposes a novel method ConceptRM for constructing a high-quality corpus to train a reflection model capable of effectively intercepting false alerts. With only a small amount of expert annotations as anchors, ConceptRM creates perturbed datasets with varying noise ratios and utilizes co-teaching to train multiple distinct models for collaborative learning. By analyzing the consensus decisions of these models, it effectively identifies reliable negative samples from a noisy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptRM significantly enhances the interception of false alerts with minimal annotation cost, outperforming several state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 53.31% on in-domain datasets and 41.67% on out-of-domain datasets."}

We propose a federated framework for estimating a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) hazard model of bridge deterioration, enabling municipalities to collaboratively train a shared benchmark model without transferring raw inspection records. Each User holds local inspection data and trains a log-linear hazard model over three deterioration-direction transitions -- Good$\\to$Minor, Good$\\to$Severe, and Minor$\\to$Severe -- with covariates for bridge age, coastline distance, and deck area. Local optimization is performed via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent on the CTMC log-likelihood, and only a 12-dimensional pseudo-gradient vector is uploaded to a central server per communication round. The server aggregates User updates using sample-weighted Federated Averaging (FedAvg) with momentum and gradient clipping. All experiments in this paper are conducted on fully synthetic data generated from a known ground-truth parameter set with region-specific heterogeneity, enabling controlled evaluation of federated convergence behaviour. Simulation results across heterogeneous Users show consistent convergence of the average negative log-likelihood, with the aggregated gradient norm decreasing as User scale increases. Furthermore, the federated update mechanism provides a natural participation incentive: Users who register their local inspection datasets on a shared technical-standard platform receive in return the periodically updated global benchmark parameters -- information that cannot be obtained from local data alone -- thereby enabling evidence-based life-cycle planning without surrendering data sovereignty."}

DDs are directed acyclic layered graphs; restricted DDs are a generalized greedy heuristic for finding feasible solutions, and relaxed DDs compute combinatorial relaxed bounds. There is substantial theory that leverages DD-based bounding, yet the complexity of constructing the DDs themselves has received little attention. Standard restricted DD construction requires $O(w \\log(w))$ per layer; standard relaxed DD construction requires $O(w^2)$, where $w$ is the width of the DD. Increasing $w$ improves bound quality at the cost of more time and memory.\n  We introduce implicit Decision Diagrams, storing arcs implicitly rather than explicitly, and reducing per-layer complexity to $O(w)$ for restricted and relaxed DDs. We prove this is optimal: any framework treating state-update and merge operations as black boxes cannot do better.\n  Optimal complexity shifts the challenge from algorithmic overhead to low-level engineering. We show how implicit DDs can drive a MIP solver, and release ImplicitDDs.jl, an open-source Julia solver exploiting the implementation refinements our theory enables.

Several celebrated results in statistical learning theory, such as the VC theorem and Littlestone's characterization of online learnability, establish conditions on the hypothesis class that allow for learning under independent data and adversarial data, respectively. Building upon recent work bridging these extremes, we study sequential decision making under distributional adversaries that can adaptively choose data-generating distributions from a fixed family $U$ and ask when such problems are learnable with sample complexity that behaves like the favorable independent case. We provide a near complete characterization of families $U$ that admit learnability in terms of a notion known as generalized smoothness i.e. a distribution family admits VC-dimension-dependent regret bounds for every finite-VC hypothesis class if and only if it is generalized smooth. Further, we give universal algorithms that achieve low regret under any generalized smooth adversary without explicit knowledge of $U$. Finally, when $U$ is known, we provide refined bounds in terms of a combinatorial parameter, the fragmentation number, that captures how many disjoint regions can carry nontrivial mass under $U$. These results provide a nearly complete understanding of learnability under distributional adversaries. In addition, building upon the surprising connection between online learning and differential privacy, we show that the generalized smoothness also characterizes private learnability under distributional constraints."}

We extract over 671,000 question-answer pairs from 23,000 verified interview transcripts across 1,000 public personalities, each with an average of 11.5 hours of interview content.

However, during RL training, the enormous state space of MLLM and sparse rewards often leads to entropy collapse, policy degradation, or over-exploitation of suboptimal behaviors. This necessitates an exploration strategy that maintains productive stochasticity while avoiding the drawbacks of uncontrolled random sampling, yielding inefficient exploration. In this paper, we propose CalibRL, a hybrid-policy RLVR framework that supports controllable exploration with expert guidance, enabled by two key mechanisms. First, a distribution-aware advantage weighting scales updates by group rareness to calibrate the distribution, therefore preserving exploration. Meanwhile, the asymmetric activation function (LeakyReLU) leverages the expert knowledge as a calibration baseline to moderate overconfident updates while preserving their corrective direction. CalibRL increases policy entropy in a guided manner and clarifies the target distribution by estimating the on-policy distribution through online sampling. Updates are driven by these informative behaviors, avoiding convergence to erroneous patterns. Importantly, these designs help alleviate the distributional mismatch between the model's policy and expert trajectories, thereby achieving a more stable balance between exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks, including both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrate consistent improvements, validating the effectiveness of our controllable hybrid-policy RLVR training.

In the classical Hadamard manifold framework, a subgradient provides a global lower model of a convex function expressed through the inverse exponential map. However, this model may fail to exhibit a useful convexity or concavity structure. By contrast, our characterization yields a concave bounding function by exploiting key properties of Busemann functions. We use this concavity to design and analyze difference-of-convex (DC) optimization methods on Hadamard manifolds.

More than a rhetorical question, this inquiry invites closer attention to the social and political arrangements that robot labor entails. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork across two smart-city districts in Seoul, we examine how delivery robot labor is collectively sustained. While robotic actions are often framed as autonomous and efficient, we show that each successful delivery is in fact a distributed sociotechnical achievement--reliant on human labor, regulatory coordination, and social accommodations. We argue that delivery robots do not replace labor but reconfigure it--rendering some forms more visible (robotic performance) while obscuring others (human and institutional support). Unlike industrial robots, delivery robots operate in shared public space, engage everyday passersby, and are embedded in policy and progress narratives. In these spaces, we identify \"robot privilege\"--humans routinely yielding to robots--and distinct perceptions between casual observers (\"cute\") and everyday coexisters (\"admirable\").

We build our analysis around actigraph data from the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches in Los Angeles (PASTA-LA) study conducted by the Fielding School of Public Health in the University of California, Los Angeles. Apart from achieving probabilistic imputation of actigraph time sheets, we are also able to statistically learn about the time-varying impact of explanatory variables on the magnitude of acceleration (MAG) for a cohort of subjects."}

Measuring the Impact of Human-Confusing Linguistic Features on LLM Performance", "comment": "EACL 2026 Findings", "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) hallucinations are usually treated as defects of the model or its decoding strategy. Drawing on classical linguistics, we argue that a query's form can also shape a listener's (and model's) response. We operationalize this insight by constructing a 22-dimension query feature vector covering clause complexity, lexical rarity, and anaphora, negation, answerability, and intention grounding, all known to affect human comprehension. Using 369,837 real-world queries, we ask: Are there certain types of queries that make hallucination more likely? A large-scale analysis reveals a consistent \"risk landscape\": certain features such as deep clause nesting and underspecification align with higher hallucination propensity. In contrast, clear intention grounding and answerability align with lower hallucination rates. Others, including domain specificity, show mixed, dataset- and model-dependent effects. Thus, these findings establish an empirically observable query-feature representation correlated with hallucination risk, paving the way for guided query rewriting and future intervention studies."}

Although widely studied in binary classification, these issues remain underexplored in multi-class settings, where complex inter-class relationships make minority-majority structures unclear and traditional clustering fails to capture distribution shape. Approaches that rely only on geometric distances risk removing informative samples and generating low-quality synthetic data, while binarization approaches treat imbalance locally and ignore global inter-class dependencies. At the algorithmic level, ensembles struggle to integrate weak classifiers, leading to limited robustness. This paper proposes IMOVNO+ (IMbalance-OVerlap-NOise+ Algorithm-Level Optimization), a two-level framework designed to jointly enhance data quality and algorithmic robustness for binary and multi-class tasks. At the data level, first, conditional probability is used to quantify the informativeness of each sample. Second, the dataset is partitioned into core, overlapping, and noisy regions. Third, an overlapping-cleaning algorithm is introduced that combines Z-score metrics with a big-jump gap distance. Fourth, a smart oversampling algorithm based on multi-regularization controls synthetic sample proximity, preventing new overlaps. At the algorithmic level, a meta-heuristic prunes ensemble classifiers to reduce weak-learner influence. IMOVNO+ was evaluated on 35 datasets (13 multi-class, 22 binary). Results show consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods, approaching 100% in several cases. For multi-class data, IMOVNO+ achieves gains of 37-57% in G-mean, 25-44% in F1-score, 25-39% in precision, and 26-43% in recall. In binary tasks, it attains near-perfect performance with improvements of 14-39%. The framework handles data scarcity and imbalance from collection and privacy limits."}

We present Implicit Intelligence, an evaluation framework testing whether AI agents can move beyond prompt-following to become genuine goal-fulfillers, paired with Agent-as-a-World (AaW), a harness where interactive worlds are defined in human-readable YAML files and simulated by language models. Our scenarios feature apparent simplicity in user requests, hidden complexity in correct solutions, and discoverability of constraints through environmental exploration. Evaluating 16 frontier and open-weight models across 205 scenarios, we find that even the best-performing model achieves only 48.3% scenario pass rate, revealing substantial room for improvement in bridging the gap between literal instruction-following and human-like contextual reasoning."}

To address this challenge, this study develops a domain-specific large language model (LLM) that provides optimal retrofit recommendations using homeowner-accessible descriptions of basic dwelling characteristics. The model is fine-tuned on physics-based energy simulations and techno-economic calculations derived from 536,416 U.S. residential building prototypes across nine major retrofit categories. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the LLM maps dwelling characteristics to optimal retrofit selections and associated performance outcomes. Evaluation against physics-grounded baselines shows that the model identifies the optimal retrofit for CO2 reduction within its top three recommendations in 98.9% of cases and the shortest discounted payback period in 93.3% of cases. Fine-tuning yields an order-of-magnitude reduction in CO2 prediction error and multi-fold reductions for energy use and retrofit cost. The model maintains performance under incomplete input conditions, supporting informed residential decarbonization decisions."}

To address these issues, we propose a Kolomogorov-Arnold network (KAN) in conjunction with a Koopman-based detection algorithm that leverages the unique advantages of both methods.

This online learning approach overcomes the challenges of model changes, while the integrated structure reduces the dependence on large datasets.

We propose DANCE, a doubly locally adaptive nearest-neighbor based conformal algorithm combining two novel nonconformity scores directly using the data's embedded representation.

The dearth of studies focusing on hallucinations in closed-source models is especially concerning, as they constitute the vast majority of models in institutional deployments. We introduce QueryBandits, a model-agnostic contextual bandit framework that adaptively learns online to select the optimal query-rewrite strategy by leveraging an empirically validated and calibrated reward function. Across 16 QA scenarios, our top QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a No-Rewrite baseline and outperforms zero-shot static policies (e.g., Paraphrase or Expand) by 42.6% and 60.3%, respectively. Moreover, all contextual bandits outperform vanilla bandits across all datasets, with higher feature variance coinciding with greater variance in arm selection. This substantiates our finding that there is no single rewrite policy optimal for all queries. We also discover that certain static policies incur higher cumulative regret than No-Rewrite, indicating that an inflexible query-rewriting policy can worsen hallucinations. Thus, learning an online policy over semantic features with QueryBandits can shift model behavior purely through forward-pass mechanisms, enabling its use with closed-source models and bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation."}

This process typically involves two stages: identifying the layer to edit and performing the parameter update. Intuitively, different queries may localize knowledge at different depths of the model, resulting in different sample-wise editing performance for a fixed editing layer. In this work, we hypothesize the existence of fixed golden layers that can achieve near-optimal editing performance similar to sample-wise optimal layers. To validate this hypothesis, we provide empirical evidence by comparing golden layers against ground-truth sample-wise optimal layers. Furthermore, we show that golden layers can be reliably identified using a proxy dataset and generalize effectively to unseen test set queries across datasets. Finally, we propose a novel method, namely Layer Gradient Analysis (LGA) that estimates golden layers efficiently via gradient-attribution, avoiding extensive trial-and-error across multiple editing runs. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our LGA approach across different LLM types and various knowledge editing methods."}

While prior work has focused heavily on agent fine-tuning, tool interfaces-including natural language descriptions and parameter schemas-remain largely human-oriented and often become a bottleneck, especially when agents must select from large candidate tool sets. Existing approaches to improving tool interfaces rely on execution traces, which are frequently unavailable in cold-start or privacy-constrained settings, and typically optimize each tool independently, limiting scalability and generalization to unseen tools. We propose Trace-Free+, a curriculum learning framework that progressively transfers supervision from trace-rich settings to trace-free deployment, encouraging the model to abstract reusable interface-usage patterns and tool usage outcomes. To support this approach, we construct a large-scale dataset of high-quality tool interfaces using a structured workflow over a diverse collection of tools. Experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench show consistent gains on unseen tools, strong cross-domain generalization, and robustness as the number of candidate tools scales to over 100, demonstrating that tool interface optimization is a practical and deployable complement to agent fine-tuning."}

We focus on the bounded label noise setting to determine whether the fast $1/ε$ rates achievable in single-task learning extend to this regime with minimal dependence on $k$. Surprisingly, we show that this is not the case. We demonstrate that learning across $k$ distributions inherently incurs slow rates scaling with $k/ε^2$, even under constant noise levels, unless each distribution is learned separately. A key technical contribution is a structured hypothesis-testing framework that captures the statistical cost of certifying near-optimality under bounded noise-a cost we show is unavoidable in the multi-distribution setting.\n  Finally, we prove that when competing with the stronger benchmark of each distribution's optimal Bayes error, the sample complexity incurs a \\textit{multiplicative} penalty in $k$.

We begin by performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on feature shifts induced by parameter updates. The resulting principal directions span an essential subspace that dominantly influences feature representations. Each task's parameter update matrix is projected onto its respective essential subspace for low-rank decomposition before merging. This methodology mitigates inter-task interference while preserving core task-specific functionality.

Second, at the collective level, LLMs aggregate knowledge into a unified distribution rather than exhibiting the knowledge partitioning inherent to human populations, where each person occupies a distinct region of the knowledge space. Through four studies, we demonstrate that targeted prompting interventions can address each mechanism independently: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting reduces fixation by encouraging structured reasoning (only in LLMs, not humans), while ordinary personas (versus \"creative entrepreneurs\" such as Steve Jobs) improve knowledge partitioning by serving as diverse sampling cues, anchoring generation in distinct regions of the semantic space. Combining both approaches produces the highest idea diversity, outperforming humans. These findings offer a theoretically grounded framework for understanding LLM idea diversity and practical strategies for human-AI collaborations that leverage AI's efficiency without compromising the diversity essential to a healthy innovation ecosystem."}

The original algorithm uses linear combinations of variables in a tree structure where depth is constrained to be less than the number of classes -- a limitation that proves too rigid for complex classification problems. Our extensions improve performance in multi-class settings with unequal variance-covariance structures and nonlinear class separations by allowing more splits and more flexible class groupings in the projection pursuit computation. Proposing algorithmic improvements is straightforward; demonstrating their actual utility is not. We therefore develop two visual diagnostic approaches to verify that the enhancements perform as intended. Using high-dimensional visualization techniques, we examine model fits on benchmark datasets to assess whether the algorithm behaves as theorized. An interactive web application enables users to explore the behavior of both the original and enhanced classifiers under controlled scenarios. The enhancements are implemented in the R package PPtreeExt."}

Business Simulation Games (BSG) are widely used to foster experiential learning in complex managerial and organisational contexts by exposing students to decision-making under uncertainty. In parallel, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into higher education to support learning activities. However, despite growing interest of AI in education, its specific role in BSG and its implications for knowledge creation processes remain under-theorised. Intervention. This paper reports on the integration of generative AI tools into a BSG designed for engineering students. AI was embedded as a support mechanism during the simulation to assist students in analysing events, reformulating information, and generating decision-relevant insights, while instructors retained responsibility for supervision, debriefing, and complex issues. Methods. Adopting a qualitative experience-report approach, the study draws on the SECI model (Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination, Internalisation) as an analytical framework to examine how students and instructors interacted with AI during the simulation and how different forms of knowledge were mobilised and developed. Results. The findings indicate that AI primarily supports the Combination phase of the SECI model by facilitating the rapid synthesis, reformulation, and contextualisation of explicit knowledge. In contrast, the processes of Socialisation, Externalisation, and Internalisation remained largely dependent on peer interaction, individual reflection, and instructor guidance. Discussion. The results suggest a functional boundary in human-AI collaboration within simulation-based learning. AI acts as a cognitive enhancer that improves responsiveness and access to explicit knowledge, but it does not replace the pedagogical role of instructors in supporting the development of tacit knowledge, competencies, and phronesis. Conclusion. Integrating AI into BSG can enhance learning efficiency and engagement, but effective experiential learning continues to rely on active human supervision. Future research should investigate instructional designs that better support tacit knowledge acquisition in AI-assisted simulations."}

We decompose MI into a per-class vector $C_k(x)=σ_k^{2}/(2μ_k)$, with $μ_k{=}\\mathbb{E}[p_k]$ and $σ_k^2{=}\\mathrm{Var}[p_k]$ across posterior samples. The decomposition follows from a second-order Taylor expansion of the entropy; the $1/μ_k$ weighting corrects boundary suppression and makes $C_k$ comparable across rare and common classes. By construction $\\sum_k C_k \\approx \\mathrm{MI}$, and a companion skewness diagnostic flags inputs where the approximation degrades. After characterising the axiomatic properties of $C_k$, we validate it on three tasks: (i) selective prediction for diabetic retinopathy, where critical-class $C_k$ reduces selective risk by 34.7\\% over MI and 56.2\\% over variance baselines; (ii) out-of-distribution detection on clinical and image benchmarks, where $\\sum_k C_k$ achieves the highest AUROC and the per-class view exposes asymmetric shifts invisible to MI; and (iii) a controlled label-noise study in which $\\sum_k C_k$ shows less sensitivity to injected aleatoric noise than MI under end-to-end Bayesian training, while both metrics degrade under transfer learning. Across all tasks, the quality of the posterior approximation shapes uncertainty at least as strongly as the choice of metric, suggesting that how uncertainty is propagated through the network matters as much as how it is measured."}

By decoupling Attention and MLP layers and modeling their hardware-specific latencies as functions of context length, KnapSpec adaptively identifies optimal draft configurations on the fly via a parallel dynamic programming algorithm.

We also introduce a $k$-site MPS variant that learns distributions over $k$-grams (consecutive city subsequences) using a sliding window approach, enabling parameter-efficient modeling for larger instances. Experimental validation on TSPLIB benchmark instances with up to 52 cities demonstrates that TN-GEO can outperform classical heuristics including swap and 2-opt hill-climbing.

Yet, their utility for estimating downstream performance remains unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate the relationship between model performance and the unembedding matrix geometry, particularly its effective rank. Our experiments, involving a suite of 108 OLMo-style language models trained under controlled variation, reveal several key findings. While the best-performing models often exhibit a high effective rank, this trend is not universal across tasks and training setups. Contrary to prior work, we find that low effective rank does not cause late-stage performance degradation in small models, but instead co-occurs with it; we find adversarial cases where low-rank models do not exhibit saturation. Moreover, we show that effective rank is strongly influenced by pre-training hyperparameters, such as batch size and weight decay, which in-turn affect the model's performance. Lastly, extending our analysis to other geometric metrics and final-layer representation, we find that these metrics are largely aligned, but none can reliably predict downstream performance. Overall, our findings suggest that the model's geometry, as captured by existing metrics, primarily reflects training choices rather than performance."}

However, it struggles to integrate heterogeneous modalities such as images and text, which are common in domains like healthcare and marketing, thereby limiting its applicability. To address this, we present the Multi-Modal Prior-data Fitted Network (MMPFN), which extends TabPFN to handle tabular and non-tabular modalities in a unified manner. MMPFN comprises per-modality encoders, modality projectors, and pre-trained foundation models. The modality projectors serve as the critical bridge, transforming non-tabular embeddings into tabular-compatible tokens for unified processing.

Extensive experiments on medical and general-purpose multimodal datasets demonstrate that MMPFN consistently outperforms competitive state-of-the-art methods and effectively exploits non-tabular modalities alongside tabular features.

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations. We open source our code and provide pre-trained MIMIC agents and qualitative demos at: https://mimic-research.github.io."}

Yet the increasing complexity of logistics networks, spanning multimodal transportation, cross-country routing, and pronounced regional variability, makes this prediction task inherently challenging. This paper introduces a multi-task deep learning model for delivery delay duration prediction in the presence of significant imbalanced data, where delayed shipments are rare but operationally consequential. The model embeds high-dimensional shipment features with dedicated embedding layers for tabular data, and then uses a classification-then-regression strategy to predict the delivery delay duration for on-time and delayed shipments. Unlike sequential pipelines, this approach enables end-to-end training, improves the detection of delayed cases, and supports probabilistic forecasting for uncertainty-aware decision making. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large-scale real-world dataset from an industrial partner, comprising more than 10 million historical shipment records across four major source locations with distinct regional characteristics. The proposed model is compared with traditional machine learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a mean absolute error of 0.67-0.91 days for delayed-shipment predictions, outperforming single-step tree-based regression baselines by 41-64% and two-step classify-then-regress tree-based models by 15-35%. These gains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in operational delivery delay forecasting under highly imbalanced and heterogeneous conditions."}

This work argues that \"forgetting\" in computational systems cannot be reduced to a single operation (e.g., record deletion) and should instead be treated as a sociotechnical practice with distinct mechanisms and consequences. We clarify a vocabulary that separates erasure (removing or disabling access to data artifacts), unlearning (interventions that bound or remove a data point influence on learned parameters and outputs), exclusion (upstream non-collection and omission), and forgetting as an umbrella term spanning agency, temporality, reversibility, and scale. Building on examples from machine unlearning, semantic dependencies in data management, participatory data modeling, and manipulation at scale, we show how forgetting can simultaneously protect rights and enable silencing. We propose reframing unlearning as a first-class capability in knowledge infrastructures, evaluated not only by compliance or utility retention, but by its governance properties: transparency, accountability, and epistemic justice."}

Each User holds local inspection data and trains a log-linear hazard model over three deterioration-direction transitions -- Good$\\to$Minor, Good$\\to$Severe, and Minor$\\to$Severe -- with covariates for bridge age, coastline distance, and deck area. Local optimization is performed via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent on the CTMC log-likelihood, and only a 12-dimensional pseudo-gradient vector is uploaded to a central server per communication round. The server aggregates User updates using sample-weighted Federated Averaging (FedAvg) with momentum and gradient clipping. All experiments in this paper are conducted on fully synthetic data generated from a known ground-truth parameter set with region-specific heterogeneity, enabling controlled evaluation of federated convergence behaviour. Simulation results across heterogeneous Users show consistent convergence of the average negative log-likelihood, with the aggregated gradient norm decreasing as User scale increases. Furthermore, the federated update mechanism provides a natural participation incentive: Users who register their local inspection datasets on a shared technical-standard platform receive in return the periodically updated global benchmark parameters -- information that cannot be obtained from local data alone -- thereby enabling evidence-based life-cycle planning without surrendering data sovereignty."}

Although a growing set of metrics capture many of these considerations, they are rarely organized in a way that supports consistent evaluation, leaving no unified taxonomy for assessing and comparing LLM utility across use cases. To address this gap, we introduce the Language Model Utility Taxonomy (LUX), a comprehensive framework that structures utility evaluation across four domains: performance, interaction, operations, and governance. Within each domain, LUX is organized hierarchically into thematically aligned dimensions and components, each grounded in metrics that enable quantitative comparison and alignment of model selection with intended use. In addition, an external dynamic web tool is provided to support exploration of the framework by connecting each component to a repository of relevant metrics (factors) for applied evaluation."}

Existing methods rely on rigid templates that simply concatenate fields, yielding suboptimal representations for recommendation. We propose a data-centric framework that learns verbalization for LLM-based recommendation. Using reinforcement learning, a verbalization agent transforms raw interaction histories into optimized textual contexts, with recommendation accuracy as the training signal. This agent learns to filter noise, incorporate relevant metadata, and reorganize information to improve downstream predictions. Experiments on a large-scale industrial streaming dataset show that learned verbalization delivers up to 93% relative improvement in discovery item recommendation accuracy over template-based baselines.

We introduce CausalReasoningBenchmark, a benchmark of 173 queries across 138 real-world datasets, curated from 85 peer-reviewed research papers and four widely-used causal-inference textbooks. For each query a system must produce (i) a structured identification specification that names the strategy, the treatment, outcome, and control variables, and all design-specific elements, and (ii) a point estimate with a standard error. By scoring these two components separately, our benchmark enables granular diagnosis: it distinguishes failures in causal reasoning from errors in numerical execution. Baseline results with a state-of-the-art LLM show that, while the model correctly identifies the high-level strategy in 84 % of cases, full identification-specification correctness drops to only 30 %, revealing that the bottleneck lies in the nuanced details of research design rather than in computation.

On a manually curated set of 483 instances of PI, we measure memorization: finding that 13.6% are parroted verbatim by the Pythia-6.9b model, i.e., when the model is prompted with the tokens that precede the PI in the original document, greedy decoding generates the entire PI span exactly. We expand this analysis to study models of varying sizes (160M-6.9B) and pretraining time steps (70k-143k iterations) in the Pythia model suite and find that both model size and amount of pretraining are positively correlated with memorization. Even the smallest model, Pythia-160m, parrots 2.7% of the instances exactly.

Yet the increasing complexity of logistics networks, spanning multimodal transportation, cross-country routing, and pronounced regional variability, makes this prediction task inherently challenging. This paper introduces a multi-task deep learning model for delivery delay duration prediction in the presence of significant imbalanced data, where delayed shipments are rare but operationally consequential. The model embeds high-dimensional shipment features with dedicated embedding layers for tabular data, and then uses a classification-then-regression strategy to predict the delivery delay duration for on-time and delayed shipments. Unlike sequential pipelines, this approach enables end-to-end training, improves the detection of delayed cases, and supports probabilistic forecasting for uncertainty-aware decision making. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large-scale real-world dataset from an industrial partner, comprising more than 10 million historical shipment records across four major source locations with distinct regional characteristics. The proposed model is compared with traditional machine learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a mean absolute error of 0.67-0.91 days for delayed-shipment predictions, outperforming single-step tree-based regression baselines by 41-64% and two-step classify-then-regress tree-based models by 15-35%. These gains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in operational delivery delay forecasting under highly imbalanced and heterogeneous conditions."}

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are breaking new ground in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation; however, we argue that inconspicuous distortions arising from complex multimodal interaction dynamics can lead to systematic bias. The purpose of this position paper is twofold: first, it is intended to acquaint AI researchers with phenomenological explainable approaches that rely on the physical entities that the machine experiences during training/inference, as opposed to the traditional cognitivist symbolic account or metaphysical approaches; second, it is to state that this phenomenological doctrine will be practically useful for tackling algorithmic fairness issues in MLLMs. We develop a surrogate physics-based model that describes transformer dynamics (i.e., semantic network structure and self-/cross-attention) to analyze the dynamics of cross-modal bias in MLLM, which are not fully captured by conventional embedding- or representation-level analyses. We support this position through multi-input diagnostic experiments: 1) perturbation-based analyses of emotion classification using Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemma 3n, and 2) dynamical analysis of Lorenz chaotic time-series prediction through the physical surrogate.

We reconcile these views with the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: the representational space contains directions ranging from broadly domain-general to narrowly domain-specific. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate probe generalization across five truth types (definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical), sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying, and existing honesty benchmarks. Linear probes generalize well across most domains but fail on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. Yet training on all domains jointly recovers strong performance, confirming that domain-general directions exist despite poor pairwise transfer. The geometry of probe directions explains these patterns: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probes near-perfectly predicts cross-domain generalization (R^2=0.98). Concept-erasure methods further isolate truth directions that are (1) domain-general, (2) domain-specific, or (3) shared only across particular domain subsets. Causal interventions reveal that domain-specific directions steer more effectively than domain-general ones. Finally, post-training reshapes truth geometry, pushing sycophantic lying further from other truth types, suggesting a representational basis for chat models' sycophantic tendencies. Together, our results support the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: truth directions of varying generality coexist in representational space, with post-training reshaping their geometry.

In this paper, we develop upon existing methods for rigorously demonstrating safety based on pre-deployment testing. We relax assumptions that previous AI control research made about the collusion strategies a misaligned AI might use to subvert untrusted monitoring. We develop a taxonomy covering passive self-recognition, causal collusion (hiding pre-shared signals), acausal collusion (hiding signals via Schelling points), and combined strategies. We create a safety case sketch to clearly present our argument, explicitly state our assumptions, and highlight unsolved challenges.

Applying it to 28,606 books in PG19 (pre-1920 English literature), I compute paragraph-level novelty curves using 768-dimensional SBERT embeddings, then reduce each to a 16-segment Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA). Ward-linkage clustering on PAA vectors reveals eight canonical narrative shape archetypes, from Steep Descent (rapid convergence) to Steep Ascent (escalating unpredictability). Volume--variance of the novelty trajectory--is the strongest length-independent predictor of readership (partial rho = 0.32), followed by speed (rho = 0.19) and Terminal/Initial ratio (rho = 0.19). Circuitousness shows strong raw correlation (rho = 0.41) but is 93 percent correlated with length; after control, partial rho drops to 0.11--demonstrating that naive correlations in corpus studies can be dominated by length confounds. Genre strongly constrains narrative shape (chi squared = 2121.6, p < 10 to the power negative 242), with fiction maintaining plateau profiles while nonfiction front-loads information. Historical analysis shows books became progressively more predictable between 1840 and 1910 (T/I ratio trend r = negative 0.74, p = 0.037). SAX analysis reveals 85 percent signature uniqueness, suggesting each book traces a nearly unique path through semantic space. These findings demonstrate that information-density dynamics, distinct from sentiment or topic, constitute a fundamental dimension of narrative structure with measurable consequences for reader engagement.

Building on this insight, we propose CAMEL, a confidence-gated reflection framework that performs a lightweight single-token preference decision first and selectively invokes reflection only for low-confidence instances.

Surrogate models can accelerate simulations, but generalization across diverse anatomies is challenging, particularly in data-scarce settings. We propose a two-step framework that decouples geometric representation from learning the physics response, to enable shape-informed surrogate modeling under data-scarce conditions. First, a shape model learns a compact latent representation of left ventricular geometries. The learned latent space effectively encodes anatomies and enables synthetic geometries generation for data augmentation. Second, a neural field-based surrogate model, conditioned on this geometric encoding, is trained to predict ventricular displacement under external loading. The proposed architecture performs positional encoding by using universal ventricular coordinates, which improves generalization across diverse anatomies. Geometric variability is encoded using two alternative strategies, which are systematically compared: a PCA-based approach suitable for working with point cloud representations of geometries, and a DeepSDF-based implicit neural representation learned directly from point clouds. Overall, our results, obtained on idealized and patient-specific datasets, show that the proposed approaches allow for accurate predictions and generalization to unseen geometries, and robustness to noisy or sparsely sampled inputs."}

Most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. Semantic reasoning alone is not the primary bottleneck in long-horizon manipulation. Instead, VLAs lack persistent, action-conditioned state representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control. This paper introduces RB-VLA, a belief-centric architecture trained with self-supervised world-model objectives that maintains a compact latent state encoding task-relevant history, dynamics, and object interactions. Queried once for high-level intent, the VLM provides task specification, while the belief tracks task progress and enables phase-aware, causally grounded control under partial observability without storing raw observations or scaling memory with time. The belief and intent jointly condition a diffusion policy for robust closed-loop execution. RB-VLA outperforms prior VLAs on long-horizon benchmarks, achieving 52.5% and 37.5% higher success on multi-stage pick-and-place and stacking tasks, respectively, compared to π0. It also reduces inference latency by up to 5x relative to baselines and eliminates memory growth across timesteps observed in existing VLAs. Ablations show that the belief module is the primary driver of performance, increasing success rates from 32.5% to 77.5%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of belief-based state representations for long-horizon VLA policies."}

To bridge these gaps, we propose a sparse Bayesian functional deep neural network (sBayFDNN). It learns adaptive functional embeddings through a deep Bayesian architecture to capture complex nonlinear relationships, while a structured prior enables interpretable, region-wise selection of influential domains with quantified uncertainty. Theoretically, we establish rigorous approximation error bounds, posterior consistency, and region selection consistency. These results provide the first theoretical guarantees for a Bayesian deep functional model, ensuring its reliability and statistical rigor. Empirically, comprehensive simulations and real-world studies confirm the effectiveness and superiority of sBayFDNN. Crucially, sBayFDNN excels in recognizing intricate dependencies for accurate predictions and more precisely identifies functionally meaningful regions, capabilities fundamentally beyond existing approaches."}

Its core innovation lies in extracting and reusing clustered parameter groups from the pretrained weight matrix. These groups are then used to form multiple low-rank components, all of which share only a single initialized trainable low-rank matrix. This approach cuts the number of trainable parameters while keeping the model's capacity intact. We evaluate ID-LoRA on five diverse benchmarks: Mathematical Reasoning, Code Generation, MMLU, CommonsenseQA, and Safety Alignment. ID-LoRA outperforms both full fine-tuning and existing PEFT baselines (e.g., LoRA, DoRA, HydraLoRA) while using up to 46% fewer trainable parameters than the standard LoRA.

To address these limitations, we present NativeEmbodied, a challenging benchmark for VLM-driven embodied agents that uses a unified, native low-level action space.

For more detailed analysis, we further decouple the skills required by complex tasks and construct four types of low-level tasks, each targeting a fundamental embodied skill. This joint evaluation across task and skill granularities enables fine-grained assessment of embodied agents. Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal clear deficiencies in several fundamental embodied skills, and further analysis shows that these bottlenecks significantly limit performance on high-level tasks.

QuantVLA incorporates three scale-calibrated components: (1) a selective quantization layout that integerizes all linear layers in both the language backbone and the DiT while keeping attention projections in floating point to preserve the original operator schedule; (2) attention temperature matching, a lightweight per-head scaling mechanism that stabilizes attention logits and is folded into the dequantization scales at inference; and (3) output head balancing, a per-layer residual interface calibration that mitigates post-projection energy drift. The framework requires no additional training, uses only a small unlabeled calibration buffer, and supports integer kernels for low-bit weights and activations while leaving the architecture unchanged. Across representative VLA models on LIBERO, QuantVLA exceeds the task success rates of full-precision baselines, achieves about 70% relative memory savings on the quantized components, and delivers a 1.22x speedup in end-to-end inference latency, providing a practical pathway toward scalable low-bit embodied intelligence under strict compute, memory, and power constraints."}

While recent work has shown that contrastive decoding can leverage a model's internal distributions to improve specific capabilities, its applicability remains limited to narrow behavioral scopes and scenarios. In this work, we introduce Polarity-Prompt Contrastive Decoding (PromptCD), a test-time behavior control method that generalizes contrastive decoding to broader enhancement settings. PromptCD constructs paired positive and negative guiding prompts for a target behavior and contrasts model responses-specifically token-level probability distributions in LLMs and visual attention patterns in VLMs-to reinforce desirable outcomes. This formulation extends contrastive decoding to a wide range of enhancement objectives and is applicable to both LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without additional training. For LLMs, experiments on the \"3H\" alignment objectives (helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements, indicating that post-trained models can achieve meaningful self-enhancement purely at test time. For VLMs, we further analyze contrastive effects on visual attention, showing that PromptCD significantly improves VQA performance by reinforcing behavior-consistent visual grounding. Collectively, these results highlight PromptCD as a simple, general, and cost-efficient strategy for reliable behavior control across modalities."}

We demonstrate that SOM-VQ produces more learnable token sequences in the evaluated domains while providing an explicit navigable geometry in code space. Critically, the topological organization enables intuitive human-in-the-loop control: users can steer generation by manipulating distances in token space, achieving semantic alignment without frame-level constraints.

Therefore, our proposed study incorporates comprehensive grammatical rules alongside semantic information to build a robust, lightweight classification model without resorting to full parameterised transformer models or heavy deep learning architectures. The novelty of our approach lies in its explicit encoding of sentence-level grammatical structure, including syntactic composition, phrase patterns, and complexity indicators, into a compact grammar vector, which is then fused with frozen contextual embeddings. These heterogeneous elements unified a single representation that captures both the structural and semantic characteristics of the text. Deep learning models such as Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), BiLSTMs, and transformer-based BERT and XLNET were used to train and evaluate the model, with the number of epochs varied. Based on experimental results, the unified feature representation model captures both the semantic and structural properties of text, outperforming baseline models by 2%-15%, enabling more effective learning across heterogeneous domains.

The framework produces a virtually infinite combination of data streams with controlled shift events and time-dependent data, making it a tool to evaluate methods under evolving data. CaDrift synthesizes various distributional and covariate shifts by drifting mapping functions of the SCM, which change underlying cause-and-effect relationships between features and the target. In addition, CaDrift models occasional perturbations by leveraging interventions in causal modeling. Experimental results show that, after distributional shift events, the accuracy of classifiers tends to drop, followed by a gradual retrieval, confirming the generator's effectiveness in simulating shifts.

This model completely separates between the predictive and algorithmic components, thus offering a single well-defined analysis framework that relies solely on the considered problem. Formulated through the lens of request-answer games, an OAG algorithm receives, with each incoming request, a piece of guidance which is taken from the problem's answer space; ideally, this guidance is the optimal answer for the current request, however with probability $β$, the guidance is adversarially corrupted. The goal is to develop OAG algorithms that admit good competitiveness when $β= 0$ (a.k.a. consistency) as well as when $β= 1$ (a.k.a. robustness); the appealing notion of smoothness, that in most prior work required a dedicated loss function, now arises naturally as $β$ shifts from $0$ to $1$.\n  We then describe a systematic method, called the drop or trust blindly (DTB) compiler, which transforms any online algorithm into a learning-augmented online algorithm in the OAG model. Given a prediction-oblivious online algorithm, its learning-augmented counterpart produced by applying the DTB compiler either follows the incoming guidance blindly or ignores it altogether and proceeds as the initial algorithm would have; the choice between these two alternatives is based on the outcome of a (biased) coin toss. As our main technical contribution, we prove (rigorously) that although remarkably simple, the class of algorithms produced via the DTB compiler includes algorithms with attractive consistency-robustness guarantees for three classic online problems: for caching and uniform metrical task systems our algorithms are optimal, whereas for bipartite matching (with adversarial arrival order), our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art."}

Specifically, we focus on the prototypical task of agnostically learning halfspaces under subgaussian distributions in the smoothed model. The best known upper bound for this problem relies on $L_1$-polynomial regression and has complexity $d^{\\tilde{O}(1/σ^2) \\log(1/ε)}$, where $σ$ is the smoothing parameter and $ε$ is the excess error. Our main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound providing formal evidence that this upper bound is close to best possible. In more detail, we show that (even for Gaussian marginals) any SQ algorithm for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces requires complexity $d^{Ω(1/σ^{2}+\\log(1/ε))}$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound on the complexity of this task and nearly matches the known upper bound. Roughly speaking, we show that applying $L_1$-polynomial regression to a smoothed version of the function is essentially best possible. Our techniques involve finding a moment-matching hard distribution by way of linear programming duality. This dual program corresponds exactly to finding a low-degree approximating polynomial to the smoothed version of the target function (which turns out to be the same condition required for the $L_1$-polynomial regression to work). Our explicit SQ lower bound then comes from proving lower bounds on this approximation degree for the class of halfspaces."}

We present SibylSense, an inference-time learning approach that adapts a frozen rubric generator through a tunable memory bank of validated rubric items. Memory is updated via verifier-based item rewards measured by reference-candidate answer discriminative gaps from a handful of examples. SibylSense alternates memory tuning with a rubric-adversarial policy update that produces rubric-satisfying candidate answers, shrinking discriminative gaps and driving the rubric generator to capture new quality dimensions.

Our analysis reveals that reasoning manifests as a transient geometric pulse, where concept manifolds are untangled into linearly separable subspaces immediately prior to computation and rapidly compressed thereafter. This behavior diverges from standard linear probe accuracy, which remains high long after computation, suggesting a fundamental distinction between information that is merely retrievable and information that is geometrically prepared for processing. We interpret this phenomenon as \\emph{Dynamic Manifold Management}, a mechanism where the model dynamically modulates representational capacity to optimize the bandwidth of the residual stream throughout the reasoning chain."}

Our key insight is that IPI attacks leave distinct over-focusing signatures in the latent space. We introduce a Latent Space Trace Prober to detect attacks based on high intensity scores. Subsequently, a Mitigating Rectifier performs surgical attention steering that selectively manipulate adversarial query key dependencies while amplifying task relevant elements to restore the LLM's functional trajectory. Extensive evaluations on multiple backbones show that ICON achieves a competitive 0.4% ASR, matching commercial grade detectors, while yielding a over 50% task utility gain.

In this work, we propose Graph Semantic Predictive Network (GraSPNet), a hierarchical self-supervised framework that explicitly models both atomic-level and fragment-level semantics.

But well-known problems with CoT faithfulness severely limit what insights can be gained from this practice. In this paper, we introduce a training method called Counterfactual Simulation Training (CST), which aims to improve CoT faithfulness by rewarding CoTs that enable a simulator to accurately predict a model's outputs over counterfactual inputs. We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST. These results suggest that CST can improve CoT faithfulness in general, with promising applications for CoT monitoring.

Traditional KL divergence tends to be dominated by the next tokens with the highest probabilities, i.e., the teacher's modes, thereby diminishing the influence of less probable yet potentially informative components of the output distribution. We propose a new tail-aware divergence that decouples the contribution of the teacher model's top-K predicted probabilities from that of lower-probability predictions, while maintaining the same computational profile as the KL Divergence. Our decoupled approach reduces the impact of the teacher modes and, consequently, increases the contribution of the tail of the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our modified distillation method yields competitive performance in both pre-training and supervised distillation of decoder models across various datasets. Furthermore, the distillation process is efficient and can be performed with a modest academic budget for large datasets, eliminating the need for industry-scale computing."}

The goal of this paper is to provide similar quantitative approximation results in the context of group equivariant learning, where the learned $α$-Hölder function is known to obey certain group symmetries. While there has been much interest in the literature in understanding the universal approximation properties of equivariant models, very few quantitative approximation results are known for equivariant models.\n  In this paper, we bridge this gap by deriving quantitative approximation rates for several prominent group-equivariant and invariant architectures. The architectures that we consider include: the permutation-invariant Deep Sets architecture; the permutation-equivariant Sumformer and Transformer architectures; joint invariance to permutations and rigid motions using invariant networks based on frame averaging; and general bi-Lipschitz invariant models. Overall, we show that equally-sized ReLU MLPs and equivariant architectures are equally expressive over equivariant functions.

At the fusion level, MAGNET employs structured experts with explicit modality roles -- dominant, balanced, and complementary -- enabling a more interpretable and adaptive combination of behavioral, visual, and textual cues. To further stabilize sparse routing and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a two-stage entropy-weighting mechanism that monitors routing entropy.

Causal knowledge about the data-generating process is required to identify and correct such misleading feature attributions. We propose cc-Shapley (causal context Shapley), an interventional modification of conventional observational Shapley values leveraging knowledge of the data's causal structure, thereby analyzing the relevance of a feature in the causal context of the remaining features.

Preference-based RL offers an appealing alternative by learning from human preferences over pairs of behavioural outcomes. More recently, RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can generate preference labels at scale, mitigating the reliance on human annotators. However, existing RLAIF work typically focuses only on single-objective tasks, leaving the open question of how RLAIF handles systems that involve multiple objectives. In such systems trade-offs among conflicting objectives are difficult to specify, and policies risk collapsing into optimizing for a dominant goal. In this paper, we explore the extension of the RLAIF paradigm to multi-objective self-adaptive systems. We show that multi-objective RLAIF can produce policies that yield balanced trade-offs reflecting different user priorities without laborious reward engineering. We argue that integrating RLAIF into multi-objective RL offers a scalable path toward user-aligned policy learning in domains with inherently conflicting objectives."}

BLMs are multiple-choice problems, structured at multiple levels: within each sentence, across the input sequence, within each candidate answer. Because of their rich structure, these curated, but naturalistic datasets are key to answer some core questions about current large language models abilities: do LLMs detect linguistic objects and their properties? Do they detect and use systematic patterns across sentences? Are they more prone to linguistic or reasoning errors, and how do these interact?\n  We show that BLMs, while challenging, can be solved at good levels of performance, in more than one language, with simple baseline models or, at better performance levels, with more tailored models. We show that their representations contain the grammatical objects and attributes relevant to solve a linguistic task. We also show that these solutions are reached by detecting systematic patterns across sentences.\n  The paper supports the point of view that curated, structured datasets support multi-faceted investigations of properties of language and large language models. Because they present a curated, articulated structure, because they comprise both learning contexts and expected answers, and because they are partly built by hand, BLMs fall in the category of datasets that can support explainability investigations, and be useful to ask why large language models behave the way they do."}

Although techniques from both paradigms have been shown to improve model accuracy on a wide variety of tasks, we argue that the datasets used for these evaluations could cause overoptimistic evaluation results. Unlike many real-world datasets, they often (1) have no features with more salience than truthfulness, (2) have balanced training sets, and (3) contain only data points to which the model can give a well-defined answer. We construct datasets that lack each of these properties to stress-test a range of standard unsupervised elicitation and easy-to-hard generalization techniques. We find that no technique reliably performs well on any of these challenges. We also study ensembling and combining easy-to-hard and unsupervised techniques, and find they only partially mitigate performance degradation due to these challenges. We believe that overcoming these challenges should be a priority for future work on unsupervised elicitation."}

However, most existing datasets primarily focus on linear reasoning, neglecting other parts such as proof by contradiction and proof by cases, which are crucial for investigating LLMs' reasoning abilities. To address this limitation, we first introduce a novel first-order logic (FOL) dataset named PC-FOL, annotated by professional mathematicians, focusing on case-based reasoning problems. All instances in this dataset are equipped with a manually written natural language proof, clearly distinguishing it from conventional linear reasoning datasets. Our experimental results over leading LLMs demonstrate a substantial performance gap between linear reasoning and case-based reasoning problems. To further investigate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis grounded in graphical model, which provides an explanation for the observed disparity between the two types of reasoning problems. We hope this work can reveal the core challenges in the field of automated natural language mathematical proof generation, paving the way for future research."}

In this paper, we address these challenges. First, we formulate the problem as an online saddle-point stochastic game between a decision maker and an adversary selecting worst-case distributions, and propose a general framework that converges to a robust Nash equilibrium coinciding with the solution of the corresponding offline Wasserstein DRO problem. Second, we address the main computational bottleneck, which is the repeated solution of worst-case expectation problems. For the important class of piecewise concave loss functions, we propose a tailored algorithm that exploits problem geometry to achieve substantial speedups over state-of-the-art solvers such as Gurobi.

We construct the Butterfly dataset to instantiate this framework in the environmental and ecological domain. It contains 1,094 queries that simulate ordinary solution-seeking activities whose responses may induce latent ecological impact.

Building on recent work on coverage-based exploration, we introduce a parameterized family of decomposable and concave objective functions $U_κ$ that explicitly incorporate both intrinsic estimation complexity and extrinsic visitation frequency. Moreover, the curvature $κ$ provides a unified treatment of various global objectives, such as the average-case and worst-case estimation error objectives. Using the closed-form characterization of the gradient of $U_κ$, we propose $κ$-Explorer, an active exploration algorithm that performs Frank-Wolfe-style optimization over state-action occupancy measures. The diminishing-returns structure of $U_κ$ naturally prioritizes underexplored and high-variance transitions, while preserving smoothness properties that enable efficient optimization. We establish tight regret guarantees for $κ$-Explorer and further introduce a fully online and computationally efficient surrogate algorithm for practical use.

This study proposes a hybrid approach that uses LLMs for aspect identification while employing classic machine-learning methods for sentiment classification at scale. Using ChatGPT to analyze sampled restaurant reviews, we identified key aspects of dining experiences and developed sentiment classifiers using human-labeled reviews, which we subsequently applied to 4.7 million reviews collected over 17 years from a major online platform. Regression analysis reveals that our machine-labeled aspects significantly explain variance in overall restaurant ratings across different aspects of dining experiences, cuisines, and geographical regions.

However, deploying large-scale GNN models locally is particularly challenging for users, as it requires significant computational resources and extensive property data. Consequently, Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has become increasingly popular, offering a convenient way to deploy and access various models, including GNNs. However, an emerging threat known as Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) presents significant risks, as adversaries can readily obtain surrogate GNN models exhibiting similar functionality. Specifically, attackers repeatedly query the target model using subgraph inputs to collect corresponding responses. These input-output pairs are subsequently utilized to train their own surrogate models at minimal cost. Many techniques have been proposed to defend against MEAs, but most are limited to specific output levels (e.g., embedding or label) and suffer from inherent technical drawbacks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ownership verification framework CITED which is a first-of-its-kind method to achieve ownership verification on both embedding and label levels.

Results demonstrate that the proposed domain-specific benchmark effectively and comprehensively assesses LLM capabilities, highlighting that general LLMs are still incompetent for domain-specific tasks. Meanwhile, with the proposed benchmark and datasets, Qwen-BIM is developed and achieves a 21.0% average increase in G-Eval score compared to the base LLM model. Notably, with only 14B parameters, performance of Qwen-BIM is comparable to that of general LLMs with 671B parameters for BIM-based design tasks.

Our scenarios place models under conflicting instructions, simulated tool access, and multi-turn escalation to reveal behavioural tendencies that single-turn evaluations miss. Evaluating 24 frontier models using LLM judges validated against human annotations, we find that even top-performing models exhibit gaps in specific categories, while the majority of models show consistent weaknesses across the board.

Building on this representation, we present ViLCaR, a diagnostic benchmark comprising tasks for Causal Attribution, Causal Inference, and Question Answering, along with graph-aligned evaluation metrics that assess relevance identification beyond final answer accuracy.

However, EHRs are often sparse and contain missing data due to various challenges and limitations in data collection and sharing between healthcare providers. Existing techniques for imputing missing values predominantly focus on known unknowns, such as missing or unavailable values of lab test results; most do not explicitly address situations where it is difficult to distinguish what is missing. For instance, a missing diagnosis code in an EHR could signify either that the patient has not been diagnosed with the condition or that a diagnosis was made, but not shared by a provider. Such situations fall into the paradigm of unknown unknowns. To address this challenge, we develop a general purpose algorithm for denoising data to recover unknown missing values in binary EHRs. We design a transformer-based denoising neural network where the output is thresholded adaptively to recover values in cases where we predict data are missing. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy in denoising medical codes within a real EHR dataset compared to existing imputation approaches and leads to increased performance on downstream tasks using the denoised data. In particular, when applying our method to a real world application, predicting hospital readmission from EHRs, our method achieves statistically significant improvement over all existing baselines."}

We consider the effect of prior exposure to visual images (i.e., visual context) on these judgments for humans and large language models (LLMs). Our results suggest that, in contrast to textual context, visual images appear to have little if any impact on human acceptability ratings. However, LLMs display the compression effect seen in previous work on human judgments in document contexts. Different sorts of LLMs are able to predict human acceptability judgments to a high degree of accuracy, but in general, their performance is slightly better when visual contexts are removed. Moreover, the distribution of LLM judgments varies among models, with Qwen resembling human patterns, and others diverging from them. LLM-generated predictions on sentence acceptability are highly correlated with their normalised log probabilities in general. However, the correlations decrease when visual contexts are present, suggesting that a higher gap exists between the internal representations of LLMs and their generated predictions in the presence of visual contexts. Our experimental work suggests interesting points of similarity and of difference between human and LLM processing of sentences in multimodal contexts."}

In this work, we attribute the source of varying calibration parameters to the varying token-level sensitivity caused by a precision-dependent outlier migration phenomenon.Motivated by this observation, we propose \\texttt{MoBiQuant}, a novel Mixture-of-Bits quantization framework that adjusts weight precision for elastic LLM inference based on token sensitivity. Specifically, we propose the many-in-one recursive residual quantization that can iteratively reconstruct higher-precision weights and the token-aware router to dynamically select the number of residual bit slices. MoBiQuant enables smooth precision switching while improving generalization for the distribution of token outliers. Experimental results demonstrate that MoBiQuant exhibits strong elasticity, enabling it to match the performance of bit-specific calibrated PTQ on LLaMA3-8B without repeated calibration."}

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues, it frequently overlooks structural interdependencies essential for multi-hop reasoning. Graph-based RAG approaches attempt to bridge this gap, yet they typically face trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency due to challenges such as costly graph traversals and semantic noise in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we propose HyperNode Expansion and Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization strategies for GraphRAG (HELP), a novel framework designed to balance accuracy with practical efficiency through two core strategies: 1) HyperNode Expansion, which iteratively chains knowledge triplets into coherent reasoning paths abstracted as HyperNodes to capture complex structural dependencies and ensure retrieval accuracy; and 2) Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization, which leverages precomputed graph-text correlations to map these paths directly to the corpus for superior efficiency. HELP avoids expensive random walks and semantic distortion, preserving knowledge integrity while drastically reducing retrieval latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HELP achieves competitive performance across multiple simple and multi-hop QA benchmarks and up to a 28.8$\\times$ speedup over leading Graph-based RAG baselines."}

Existing artificial intelligence approaches typically optimize individual components of phenotyping but do not operationalize the full clinical workflow of extracting features from clinical text, standardizing them to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, and prioritizing diagnostically informative HPO terms. We developed RARE-PHENIX, an end-to-end AI framework for rare disease phenotyping that integrates large language model-based phenotype extraction, ontology-grounded standardization to HPO terms, and supervised ranking of diagnostically informative phenotypes. We trained RARE-PHENIX using data from 2,671 patients across 11 Undiagnosed Diseases Network clinical sites, and externally validated it on 16,357 real-world clinical notes from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Using clinician-curated HPO terms as the gold standard, RARE-PHENIX consistently outperformed a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline (PhenoBERT) across ontology-based similarity and precision-recall-F1 metrics in end-to-end evaluation (i.e., ontology-based similarity of 0.70 vs. 0.58). Ablation analyses demonstrated performance improvements with the addition of each module in RARE-PHENIX (extraction, standardization, and prioritization), supporting the value of modeling the full clinical phenotyping workflow. By modeling phenotyping as a clinically aligned workflow rather than a single extraction task, RARE-PHENIX provides structured, ranked phenotypes that are more concordant with clinician curation and has the potential to support human-in-the-loop rare disease diagnosis in real-world settings."}

However, the learning process tends to be costly. To address this, we present a novel paradigm named Attention Neural Teaching (AtteNT) that reinterprets the learning process through a nonparametric teaching perspective. Specifically, the latter provides a theoretical framework for teaching mappings that are implicitly defined (i.e., nonparametric) via example selection. Such an implicit mapping is embodied through a dense set of sequence-property pairs, with the AtteNT teacher selecting a subset to accelerate convergence in attention learner training. By analytically investigating the role of attention on parameter-based gradient descent during training, and recasting the evolution of attention learners, shaped by parameter updates, through functional gradient descent in nonparametric teaching, we show for the first time that teaching attention learners is consistent with teaching importance-adaptive nonparametric learners. These new findings readily commit AtteNT to enhancing learning efficiency of attention learners. Specifically, we observe training time reductions of 13.01% for LLMs and 20.58% for ViTs, spanning both fine-tuning and training-from-scratch regimes. Crucially, these gains are achieved without compromising accuracy; in fact, performance is consistently preserved and often enhanced across a diverse set of downstream tasks."}

However, many real-world reasoning problems admit multiple valid derivations, requiring models to explore diverse logical paths rather than committing to one route. To address this limitation, we introduce LogicGraph, the first benchmark aimed to systematically evaluate multi-path logical reasoning, constructed via a neuro-symbolic framework that leverages backward logic generation and semantic instantiation. This pipeline yields solver-verified reasoning problems formalized by high-depth multi-path reasoning and inherent logical distractions, where each instance is associated with an exhaustive set of minimal proofs. We further propose a reference-free evaluation framework to rigorously assess model performance in both convergent and divergent regimes. Experiments on state-of-the-art language models reveal a common limitation: models tend to commit early to a single route and fail to explore alternatives, and the coverage gap grows substantially with reasoning depth. LogicGraph exposes this divergence gap and provides actionable insights to motivate future improvements. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/kkkkarry/LogicGraph."}

Based on this perspective, we propose a new likelihood learning formulation that aligns the long-short flow-map decomposition with density evolution under transport. We validate the framework through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on benchmark tests, and further provide a theoretical interpretation of the feature-space optimization while highlighting several open problems for future study."}

Pruning techniques affirmed themselves as valid tools to extract sparse representations of neural networks parameters, carefully balancing between compression and preservation of information. However, a fundamental assumption behind pruning is that expendable weights should have small impact on the error of the network, while highly important weights should tend to have a larger influence on the inference. We argue that this idea could be generalized; what if a weight is not simply removed but also compensated with a perturbation of the adjacent bias, which does not contribute to the network sparsity? Our work introduces a novel pruning method in which the importance measure of each weight is computed considering the output behavior after an optimal perturbation of its adjacent bias, efficiently computable by automatic differentiation. These perturbations can be then applied directly after the removal of each weight, independently of each other. After deriving analytical expressions for the aforementioned quantities, numerical experiments are conducted to benchmark this technique against some of the most popular pruning strategies, demonstrating an intrinsic efficiency of the proposed approach in very diverse machine learning scenarios. Finally, our findings are discussed and the theoretical implications of our results are presented."}

The framework mimics the emotional state of high curiosity and anticipation of reward in which broader brain regions are recruited to enhance cognitive performance. Exploiting scalable architectures where larger models extend smaller ones, our method enables shared weight updates and selective expansion of network capacity during noteworthy training steps. Empirical evaluation on the image classification task demonstrates that, not only does the alternating training scheme efficiently and effectively enhance the base model compared to a traditional scheme, in some cases, the motivational model also surpasses its standalone counterpart despite seeing less data per epoch. This opens the possibility of simultaneously training two models tailored to different deployment constraints with competitive or superior performance while keeping training cost lower than when training the larger model."}

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations. We open source our code and provide pre-trained MIMIC agents and qualitative demos at: https://mimic-research.github.io."}

However, the evolving inter-variable dependencies and inevitable noise render it challenging. Existing methods often use single-scale graphs or instance-level contrast. Moreover, learned dynamic graphs can overfit noise without a stable anchor, causing false alarms or misses. To address these challenges, we propose the CGSTA framework with two key innovations. First, Dynamic Layered Graph Construction (DLGC) forms local, regional, and global views of variable relations for each sliding window; rather than contrasting whole windows, Contrastive Discrimination across Scales (CDS) contrasts graph representations within each view and aligns the same window across views to make learning structure-aware. Second, Stability-Aware Alignment (SAA) maintains a per-scale stable reference learned from normal data and guides the current window's fast-changing graphs toward it to suppress noise. We fuse the multi-scale and temporal features and use a conditional density estimator to produce per-time-step anomaly scores. Across four benchmarks, CGSTA delivers optimal performance on PSM and WADI, and is comparable to the baseline methods on SWaT and SMAP."}

When encountering an unfamiliar KG, such users face a distinct orientation challenge: they do not know what questions are possible, how the knowledge is structured, or how to begin exploration. This paper identifies and theorises this phenomenon as the Initial Exploration Problem (IEP). Drawing on theories from information behaviour and human-computer interaction, including ASK, exploratory search, information foraging, and cognitive load theory, we develop a conceptual framing of the IEP characterised by three interdependent barriers: scope uncertainty, ontology opacity, and query incapacity. We argue that these barriers converge at the moment of first contact, distinguishing the IEP from related concepts that presuppose an existing starting point or information goal. Analysing KG exploration interfaces at the level of interaction primitives, we suggest that many systems rely on epistemic assumptions that do not hold at first contact. This reveals a structural gap in the design space: the absence of interaction primitives for scope revelation, mechanisms that communicate what a KG contains without requiring users to formulate queries or interpret ontological structures. In articulating the IEP, this paper provides a theoretical lens for evaluating KG interfaces and for designing entry-point scaffolding that supports initial exploration."}

Recent multimodal approaches that integrate ECGs with accompanying clinical reports show strong potential, but they still face two main concerns from a modality perspective: (1) intra-modality: existing models process ECGs in a lead-agnostic manner, overlooking spatial-temporal dependencies across leads, which restricts their effectiveness in modeling fine-grained diagnostic patterns; (2) inter-modality: existing methods directly align ECG signals with clinical reports, introducing modality-specific biases due to the free-text nature of the reports. In light of these two issues, we propose CG-DMER, a contrastive-generative framework for disentangled multimodal ECG representation learning, powered by two key designs: (1) Spatial-temporal masked modeling is designed to better capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and inter-lead spatial dependencies by applying masking across both spatial and temporal dimensions and reconstructing the missing information. (2) A representation disentanglement and alignment strategy is designed to mitigate unnecessary noise and modality-specific biases by introducing modality-specific and modality-shared encoders, ensuring a clearer separation between modality-invariant and modality-specific representations. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that CG-DMER achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks."}

But well-known problems with CoT faithfulness severely limit what insights can be gained from this practice. In this paper, we introduce a training method called Counterfactual Simulation Training (CST), which aims to improve CoT faithfulness by rewarding CoTs that enable a simulator to accurately predict a model's outputs over counterfactual inputs. We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST. These results suggest that CST can improve CoT faithfulness in general, with promising applications for CoT monitoring.

In contrast, Apprenticeship Learning (AL) uses a few expert demonstrations to infer the expert's underlying reward functions and derive decision-making policies that generalize and replicate optimal behavior. In this work, we leverage a generalized AL framework, THEMES, to induce effective pedagogical policies by capturing the complexities of the expert student learning process, where multiple reward functions may dynamically evolve over time. We evaluate the effectiveness of THEMES against six state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its superior performance and highlighting its potential as a powerful alternative for inducing effective pedagogical policies and show that it can achieve high performance, with an AUC of 0.899 and a Jaccard of 0.653, using only 18 trajectories of a previous semester to predict student pedagogical decisions in a later semester."}

We consider the effect of prior exposure to visual images (i.e., visual context) on these judgments for humans and large language models (LLMs). Our results suggest that, in contrast to textual context, visual images appear to have little if any impact on human acceptability ratings. However, LLMs display the compression effect seen in previous work on human judgments in document contexts. Different sorts of LLMs are able to predict human acceptability judgments to a high degree of accuracy, but in general, their performance is slightly better when visual contexts are removed. Moreover, the distribution of LLM judgments varies among models, with Qwen resembling human patterns, and others diverging from them. LLM-generated predictions on sentence acceptability are highly correlated with their normalised log probabilities in general. However, the correlations decrease when visual contexts are present, suggesting that a higher gap exists between the internal representations of LLMs and their generated predictions in the presence of visual contexts. Our experimental work suggests interesting points of similarity and of difference between human and LLM processing of sentences in multimodal contexts."}

Real-world human emotional experiences, by contrast, are often characterized by the simultaneous presence of multiple affective states, spurring recent interest in mixed emotion recognition as an emotion distribution learning problem. Current approaches, however, often neglect the valence consistency and structured correlations inherent among coexisting emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a Memory-guided Prototypical Co-occurrence Learning (MPCL) framework that explicitly models emotion co-occurrence patterns. Specifically, we first fuse multi-modal signals via a multi-scale associative memory mechanism. To capture cross-modal semantic relationships, we construct emotion-specific prototype memory banks, yielding rich physiological and behavioral representations, and employ prototype relation distillation to ensure cross-modal alignment in the latent prototype space. Furthermore, inspired by human cognitive memory systems, we introduce a memory retrieval strategy to extract semantic-level co-occurrence associations across emotion categories. Through this bottom-up hierarchical abstraction process, our model learns affectively informative representations for accurate emotion distribution prediction. Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that MPCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in mixed emotion recognition, both quantitatively and qualitatively."}

SELAUR integrates entropy-, least-confidence-, and margin-based metrics into a combined token-level uncertainty estimate, providing dense confidence-aligned supervision, and employs a failure-aware reward reshaping mechanism that injects these uncertainty signals into step- and trajectory-level rewards to improve exploration efficiency and learning stability.

In Bayesian inverse problems, this could be achieved by evaluating the model evidence $p(y \\mid M)$ under different models $M$ that specify the prior and then selecting the one with the highest value. Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art approach to solving inverse problems with a data-driven prior; however, directly computing the model evidence with respect to a diffusion prior is intractable. Furthermore, most existing model evidence estimators require either many pointwise evaluations of the unnormalized prior density or an accurate clean prior score. We propose \\method, an estimator of the model evidence of a diffusion prior by integrating over the time-marginals of posterior sampling methods. Our method leverages the large amount of intermediate samples naturally obtained during the reverse diffusion sampling process to obtain an accurate estimation of the model evidence using only a handful of posterior samples (e.g., 20). We also demonstrate how to implement our estimator in tandem with recent diffusion posterior sampling methods. Empirically, our estimator matches the model evidence when it can be computed analytically, and it is able to both select the correct diffusion model prior and diagnose prior misfit under different highly ill-conditioned, non-linear inverse problems, including a real-world black hole imaging problem."}

However, most methods search within a discrete equation space, where the structural modifications of equations rarely align with their numerical behavior, leaving fitting error feedback too noisy to guide exploration. To address this challenge, we propose GenSR, a generative latent space-based SR framework following the `map construction -> coarse localization -> fine search'' paradigm. Specifically, GenSR first pretrains a dual-branch Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to reparameterize symbolic equations into a generative latent space with symbolic continuity and local numerical smoothness. This space can be regarded as a well-structured `map'' of the equation space, providing directional signals for search. At inference, the CVAE coarsely localizes the input data to promising regions in the latent space. Then, a modified CMA-ES refines the candidate region, leveraging smooth latent gradients. From a Bayesian perspective, GenSR reframes the SR task as maximizing the conditional distribution $p(\\mathrm{Equ.} \\mid \\mathrm{Num.})$, with CVAE training achieving this objective through the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). This new perspective provides a theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of GenSR. Extensive experiments show that GenSR jointly optimizes predictive accuracy, expression simplicity, and computational efficiency, while remaining robust under noise."}

However, a key challenge is the noisy nature of such data as it is often collected in production environments. As cleaning noise via manual annotation incurs high costs, this paper proposes a novel method ConceptRM for constructing a high-quality corpus to train a reflection model capable of effectively intercepting false alerts. With only a small amount of expert annotations as anchors, ConceptRM creates perturbed datasets with varying noise ratios and utilizes co-teaching to train multiple distinct models for collaborative learning. By analyzing the consensus decisions of these models, it effectively identifies reliable negative samples from a noisy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptRM significantly enhances the interception of false alerts with minimal annotation cost, outperforming several state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 53.31% on in-domain datasets and 41.67% on out-of-domain datasets."}

While convergence properties of such methods are well understood, their finite-iteration stability and generalization behavior remain unclear due to structural bias induced by column-stochastic mixing and asymmetric error propagation. In this work, we develop a unified uniform-stability framework for the Stochastic Gradient Push (SGP) algorithm that captures the effect of directed topology. A key technical ingredient is an imbalance-aware consistency bound for Push-Sum, which controls consensus deviation through two quantities: the stationary distribution imbalance parameter $δ$ and the spectral gap $(1-λ)$ governing mixing speed. This decomposition enables us to disentangle statistical effects from topology-induced bias. We establish finite-iteration stability and optimization guarantees for both convex objectives and non-convex objectives satisfying the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition. For convex problems, SGP attains excess generalization error of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{mn}}+\\fracγ{δ(1-λ)}+γ\\right)$ under step-size schedules, and we characterize the corresponding optimal early stopping time that minimizes this bound. For PŁ objectives, we obtain convex-like optimization and generalization rates with dominant dependence proportional to $κ\\!\\left(1+\\frac{1}{δ(1-λ)}\\right)$, revealing a multiplicative coupling between problem conditioning and directed communication topology. Our analysis clarifies when Push-Sum correction is necessary compared with standard decentralized SGD and quantifies how imbalance and mixing jointly shape the best attainable learning performance."}

Across multiple modeling approaches, predictive performance declines only modestly when limited to vitals, indicating that early physiological measurements retain substantial clinical signal.

These graphs can subsequently be used to train geometric DL models like GNN. GNN learns the inherent structural relationships within a molecule rather than depending on fixed-size fingerprints. Although GNN are powerful aggregators, their efficacy on smaller datasets and inductive biases across different architectures is less studied. In our present study, we performed a systematic benchmarking of four different GNN architectures across a diverse domain of datasets (physical chemistry, biological, and analytical). Additionally, we have also implemented a hierarchical fusion (GNN+FP) framework for target prediction. We observed that the fusion framework consistently outperforms or matches the performance of standalone GNN (RMSE improvement > $7\\%$) and baseline models. Further, we investigated the representational similarity using centered kernel alignment (CKA) between GNN and fingerprint embeddings and found that they occupy highly independent latent spaces (CKA $\\le0.46$).

A Feature-Based Triggerless Backdoor Attack in Vertical Federated Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "As a distributed collaborative machine learning paradigm, vertical federated learning (VFL) allows multiple passive parties with distinct features and one active party with labels to collaboratively train a model. Although it is known for the privacy-preserving capabilities, VFL still faces significant privacy and security threats from backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks typically involve an attacker implanting a trigger into the model during the training phase and executing the attack by adding the trigger to the samples during the inference phase. However, in this paper, we find that triggers are not essential for backdoor attacks in VFL. In light of this, we disclose a new backdoor attack pathway in VFL by introducing a feature-based triggerless backdoor attack. This attack operates under a more stringent security assumption, where the attacker is honest-but-curious rather than malicious during the training phase. It comprises three modules: label inference for the targeted backdoor attack, poison generation with amplification and perturbation mechanisms, and backdoor execution to implement the attack. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our attack outperforms three baseline backdoor attacks by 2 to 50 times while minimally impacting the main task. Even in VFL scenarios with 32 passive parties and only one set of auxiliary data, our attack maintains high performance. Moreover, when confronted with distinct defense strategies, our attack remains largely unaffected and exhibits strong robustness. We hope that the disclosure of this triggerless backdoor attack pathway will encourage the community to revisit security threats in VFL scenarios and inspire researchers to develop more robust and practical defense strategies."}

In this work, we attribute the source of varying calibration parameters to the varying token-level sensitivity caused by a precision-dependent outlier migration phenomenon.Motivated by this observation, we propose \\texttt{MoBiQuant}, a novel Mixture-of-Bits quantization framework that adjusts weight precision for elastic LLM inference based on token sensitivity. Specifically, we propose the many-in-one recursive residual quantization that can iteratively reconstruct higher-precision weights and the token-aware router to dynamically select the number of residual bit slices. MoBiQuant enables smooth precision switching while improving generalization for the distribution of token outliers. Experimental results demonstrate that MoBiQuant exhibits strong elasticity, enabling it to match the performance of bit-specific calibrated PTQ on LLaMA3-8B without repeated calibration."}

To quantify this, we introduce QEDBench, the first large-scale dual-rubric alignment benchmark to systematically measure alignment with human experts on university-level math proofs by contrasting course-specific rubrics against expert common knowledge criteria. By deploying a dual-evaluation matrix (7 judges x 5 solvers) against 1,000+ hours of human evaluation, we reveal that certain frontier evaluators like Claude Opus 4.5, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen 2.5 Max, and Llama 4 Maverick exhibit significant positive bias (up to +0.18, +0.20, +0.30, +0.36 mean score inflation, respectively).

Specifically, their average human evaluation scores drop to 0.72 and 0.63 in Discrete Math, and to 0.74 and 0.50 in Graph Theory.

However, during RL training, the enormous state space of MLLM and sparse rewards often leads to entropy collapse, policy degradation, or over-exploitation of suboptimal behaviors. This necessitates an exploration strategy that maintains productive stochasticity while avoiding the drawbacks of uncontrolled random sampling, yielding inefficient exploration. In this paper, we propose CalibRL, a hybrid-policy RLVR framework that supports controllable exploration with expert guidance, enabled by two key mechanisms. First, a distribution-aware advantage weighting scales updates by group rareness to calibrate the distribution, therefore preserving exploration. Meanwhile, the asymmetric activation function (LeakyReLU) leverages the expert knowledge as a calibration baseline to moderate overconfident updates while preserving their corrective direction. CalibRL increases policy entropy in a guided manner and clarifies the target distribution by estimating the on-policy distribution through online sampling. Updates are driven by these informative behaviors, avoiding convergence to erroneous patterns. Importantly, these designs help alleviate the distributional mismatch between the model's policy and expert trajectories, thereby achieving a more stable balance between exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks, including both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrate consistent improvements, validating the effectiveness of our controllable hybrid-policy RLVR training.

Initially, trajectory generation is conceptualized as an offline reinforcement learning (RL) problem, with a significant reduction in vocabulary space achieved during tokenization. The integration of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) allows for the capture of trajectory-wise reward signals, leveraging historical data to infer individual mobility preferences. Subsequently, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned using the constructed reward model, effectively addressing the challenges inherent in traditional RL-based autoregressive methods, such as long-term credit assignment and handling of sparse reward environments. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets illustrate that our framework markedly surpasses existing models in terms of reliability and diversity.

Although widely studied in binary classification, these issues remain underexplored in multi-class settings, where complex inter-class relationships make minority-majority structures unclear and traditional clustering fails to capture distribution shape. Approaches that rely only on geometric distances risk removing informative samples and generating low-quality synthetic data, while binarization approaches treat imbalance locally and ignore global inter-class dependencies. At the algorithmic level, ensembles struggle to integrate weak classifiers, leading to limited robustness. This paper proposes IMOVNO+ (IMbalance-OVerlap-NOise+ Algorithm-Level Optimization), a two-level framework designed to jointly enhance data quality and algorithmic robustness for binary and multi-class tasks. At the data level, first, conditional probability is used to quantify the informativeness of each sample. Second, the dataset is partitioned into core, overlapping, and noisy regions. Third, an overlapping-cleaning algorithm is introduced that combines Z-score metrics with a big-jump gap distance. Fourth, a smart oversampling algorithm based on multi-regularization controls synthetic sample proximity, preventing new overlaps. At the algorithmic level, a meta-heuristic prunes ensemble classifiers to reduce weak-learner influence. IMOVNO+ was evaluated on 35 datasets (13 multi-class, 22 binary). Results show consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods, approaching 100% in several cases.

To bridge these gaps, we propose a sparse Bayesian functional deep neural network (sBayFDNN). It learns adaptive functional embeddings through a deep Bayesian architecture to capture complex nonlinear relationships, while a structured prior enables interpretable, region-wise selection of influential domains with quantified uncertainty. Theoretically, we establish rigorous approximation error bounds, posterior consistency, and region selection consistency. These results provide the first theoretical guarantees for a Bayesian deep functional model, ensuring its reliability and statistical rigor.

In this work, we hypothesize the existence of fixed golden layers that can achieve near-optimal editing performance similar to sample-wise optimal layers. To validate this hypothesis, we provide empirical evidence by comparing golden layers against ground-truth sample-wise optimal layers. Furthermore, we show that golden layers can be reliably identified using a proxy dataset and generalize effectively to unseen test set queries across datasets. Finally, we propose a novel method, namely Layer Gradient Analysis (LGA) that estimates golden layers efficiently via gradient-attribution, avoiding extensive trial-and-error across multiple editing runs.

While AI for Science has witnessed the transformative power of foundation models in disciplines like genomics and meteorology, urban computing remains fragmented due to \"scenario-specific\" models, which are overfitted to specific regions or tasks, hindering their generalizability. To bridge this gap and advance spatio-temporal foundation models for urban systems, we adopt scaling as the central perspective and systematically investigate two key questions: what to scale and how to scale. Grounded in first-principles analysis, we identify three critical dimensions: heterogeneity, correlation, and dynamics, aligning these principles with the fundamental scientific properties of urban spatio-temporal data. Specifically, to address heterogeneity through data scaling, we construct WorldST. This billion-scale corpus standardizes diverse physical signals, such as traffic flow and speed, from over 100 global cities into a unified data format. To enable computation scaling for modeling correlations, we introduce the MiniST unit, a novel split mechanism that discretizes continuous spatio-temporal fields into learnable computational units to unify representations of grid-based and sensor-based observations. Finally, addressing dynamics via architecture scaling, we propose UrbanFM, a minimalist self-attention architecture designed with limited inductive biases to autonomously learn dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies from massive data. Furthermore, we establish EvalST, the largest-scale urban spatio-temporal benchmark to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UrbanFM achieves remarkable zero-shot generalization across unseen cities and tasks, marking a pivotal first step toward large-scale urban spatio-temporal foundation models."}

We formalize this challenge through a double corruption landscape: an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of users are entirely adversarial, while the remaining ``good'' users provide data from distributions that are related to $P$, but deviate by a proximity parameter $α$.\n  Unlike existing work on the untrusted batch model, which typically measures this deviation via total variation distance in discrete settings, we address the continuous, high-dimensional regime under two natural variants for deviation: (1) good batches are drawn from distributions with a mean-shift of $\\sqrtα$, or (2) an $α$-fraction of samples within each good batch are adversarially corrupted. In particular, the second model presents significant new challenges: in high dimensions, unlike discrete settings, even a small fraction of sample-level corruption can shift empirical means and covariances arbitrarily.\n  We provide two Sum-of-Squares (SoS) based algorithms to navigate this tiered corruption.

Surrogate models can accelerate hydraulic-structure design, but progress is limited by scarce large, well-documented datasets that jointly capture geometric variation, operating conditions, and functional performance. This study presents WeirNet, a large 3D CFD benchmark dataset for geometric surrogate modeling of PKWs. WeirNet contains 3,794 parametric, feasibility-constrained rectangular and trapezoidal PKW geometries, each scheduled at 19 discharge conditions using a consistent free-surface OpenFOAM workflow, resulting in 71,387 completed simulations that form the benchmark and with complete discharge coefficient labels. The dataset is released as multiple modalities compact parametric descriptors, watertight surface meshes and high-resolution point clouds together with standardized tasks and in-distribution and out-of-distribution splits. Representative surrogate families are benchmarked for discharge coefficient prediction. Tree-based regressors on parametric descriptors achieve the best overall accuracy, while point- and mesh-based models remain competitive and offer parameterization-agnostic inference. All surrogates evaluate in milliseconds per sample, providing orders-of-magnitude speedups over CFD runtimes. Out-of-distribution results identify geometry shift as the dominant failure mode compared to unseen discharge values, and data-efficiency experiments show diminishing returns beyond roughly 60% of the training data.

To address this, we present the Multi-Modal Prior-data Fitted Network (MMPFN), which extends TabPFN to handle tabular and non-tabular modalities in a unified manner. MMPFN comprises per-modality encoders, modality projectors, and pre-trained foundation models. The modality projectors serve as the critical bridge, transforming non-tabular embeddings into tabular-compatible tokens for unified processing. To this end, we introduce a multi-head gated MLP and a cross-attention pooler that extract richer context from non-tabular inputs while mitigates attention imbalance issue in multimodal learning. Extensive experiments on medical and general-purpose multimodal datasets demonstrate that MMPFN consistently outperforms competitive state-of-the-art methods and effectively exploits non-tabular modalities alongside tabular features.

Yet the increasing complexity of logistics networks, spanning multimodal transportation, cross-country routing, and pronounced regional variability, makes this prediction task inherently challenging. This paper introduces a multi-task deep learning model for delivery delay duration prediction in the presence of significant imbalanced data, where delayed shipments are rare but operationally consequential. The model embeds high-dimensional shipment features with dedicated embedding layers for tabular data, and then uses a classification-then-regression strategy to predict the delivery delay duration for on-time and delayed shipments. Unlike sequential pipelines, this approach enables end-to-end training, improves the detection of delayed cases, and supports probabilistic forecasting for uncertainty-aware decision making. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large-scale real-world dataset from an industrial partner, comprising more than 10 million historical shipment records across four major source locations with distinct regional characteristics. The proposed model is compared with traditional machine learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a mean absolute error of 0.67-0.91 days for delayed-shipment predictions, outperforming single-step tree-based regression baselines by 41-64% and two-step classify-then-regress tree-based models by 15-35%. These gains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in operational delivery delay forecasting under highly imbalanced and heterogeneous conditions."}

However, push-forward models are opaque as they lack the modularity of Bayes Theorem, leading to poor generalisation with respect to changes in the likelihood function. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to GAN architecture design by applying deep unfolding to Langevin MCMC algorithms. This paradigm maps fixed-step iterative algorithms onto modular neural networks, yielding architectures that are both flexible and amenable to interpretation. Crucially, our design allows key model parameters to be specified at inference time, offering robustness to changes in the likelihood parameters. We train these unfolded samplers end-to-end using a supervised regularized Wasserstein GAN framework for posterior sampling. Through extensive Bayesian imaging experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves high sampling accuracy and excellent computational efficiency, while retaining the physics consistency, adaptability and interpretability of classical MCMC strategies."}

We extract over 671,000 question-answer pairs from 23,000 verified interview transcripts across 1,000 public personalities, each with an average of 11.5 hours of interview content.

Through systematic comparison, we demonstrate that methods grounded in real interview data substantially outperform those relying solely on biographical profiles or the model's parametric knowledge. We further reveal a trade-off in how interview data is best utilized: retrieval-augmented methods excel at capturing personality style and response quality, while chronological-based methods better preserve factual consistency and knowledge retention. Our evaluation framework enables principled method selection based on application requirements, and our empirical findings provide actionable insights for advancing personality simulation research."}

Energy Demand Forecasting (EDF) of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipments (EVSEs) is one of the most critical operations for ensuring efficient energy management and sustainability, since it enables utility providers to anticipate energy/power demand, optimize resource allocation, and implement proactive measures to improve grid reliability. However, accurate EDF is a challenging problem due to external factors, such as the varying user routines, weather conditions, driving behaviors, unknown state of charge, etc. Furthermore, as concerns and restrictions about privacy and sustainability have grown, training data has become increasingly fragmented, resulting in distributed datasets scattered across different data silos and/or edge devices, calling for federated learning solutions. In this paper, we investigate different well-established time series forecasting methodologies to address the EDF problem, from statistical methods (the ARIMA family) to traditional machine learning models (such as XGBoost) and deep neural networks (GRU and LSTM). We provide an overview of these methods through a performance comparison over four real-world EVSE datasets, evaluated under both centralized and federated learning paradigms, focusing on the trade-offs between forecasting fidelity, privacy preservation, and energy overheads. Our experimental results demonstrate, on the one hand, the superiority of gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) over statistical and NN-based models in both prediction accuracy and energy efficiency and, on the other hand, an insight that Federated Learning-enabled models balance these factors, offering a promising direction for decentralized energy demand forecasting."}

We operationalize this insight by constructing a 22-dimension query feature vector covering clause complexity, lexical rarity, and anaphora, negation, answerability, and intention grounding, all known to affect human comprehension. Using 369,837 real-world queries, we ask: Are there certain types of queries that make hallucination more likely? A large-scale analysis reveals a consistent \"risk landscape\": certain features such as deep clause nesting and underspecification align with higher hallucination propensity. In contrast, clear intention grounding and answerability align with lower hallucination rates. Others, including domain specificity, show mixed, dataset- and model-dependent effects. Thus, these findings establish an empirically observable query-feature representation correlated with hallucination risk, paving the way for guided query rewriting and future intervention studies."}

Within this framework, we derive a closed-form analysis of adaptability, memorability, and generalization from the perspective of rehearsal scale. Our results uncover several intriguing and counterintuitive findings. First, rehearsal can impair model's adaptability, in sharp contrast to its traditionally recognized benefits. Second, increasing the rehearsal scale does not necessarily improve memory retention. When tasks are similar and noise levels are low, the memory error exhibits a diminishing lower bound. Finally, we validate these insights through numerical simulations and extended analyses on deep neural networks across multiple real-world datasets, revealing statistical patterns of rehearsal mechanisms in continual learning."}

Surrogate models can accelerate simulations, but generalization across diverse anatomies is challenging, particularly in data-scarce settings.

First, a shape model learns a compact latent representation of left ventricular geometries. The learned latent space effectively encodes anatomies and enables synthetic geometries generation for data augmentation. Second, a neural field-based surrogate model, conditioned on this geometric encoding, is trained to predict ventricular displacement under external loading. The proposed architecture performs positional encoding by using universal ventricular coordinates, which improves generalization across diverse anatomies. Geometric variability is encoded using two alternative strategies, which are systematically compared: a PCA-based approach suitable for working with point cloud representations of geometries, and a DeepSDF-based implicit neural representation learned directly from point clouds. Overall, our results, obtained on idealized and patient-specific datasets, show that the proposed approaches allow for accurate predictions and generalization to unseen geometries, and robustness to noisy or sparsely sampled inputs."}

By deriving the optimal parameter update magnitude that minimizes forgetting, we unify two representative update paradigms, frozen training and initialized training, within an optimization framework for constrained parameter updates. Our theoretical results further reveals that sequence tasks with small parameter distances exhibit better generalization and less forgetting under frozen training rather than initialized training.

The dearth of studies focusing on hallucinations in closed-source models is especially concerning, as they constitute the vast majority of models in institutional deployments. We introduce QueryBandits, a model-agnostic contextual bandit framework that adaptively learns online to select the optimal query-rewrite strategy by leveraging an empirically validated and calibrated reward function. Across 16 QA scenarios, our top QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a No-Rewrite baseline and outperforms zero-shot static policies (e.g., Paraphrase or Expand) by 42.6% and 60.3%, respectively. Moreover, all contextual bandits outperform vanilla bandits across all datasets, with higher feature variance coinciding with greater variance in arm selection. This substantiates our finding that there is no single rewrite policy optimal for all queries. We also discover that certain static policies incur higher cumulative regret than No-Rewrite, indicating that an inflexible query-rewriting policy can worsen hallucinations. Thus, learning an online policy over semantic features with QueryBandits can shift model behavior purely through forward-pass mechanisms, enabling its use with closed-source models and bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation."}

Genuinely solving such tasks requires Dec-POMDP reasoning, where agents use history to infer hidden states and coordinate based on local information. Yet it remains unclear whether popular benchmarks actually demand this reasoning or permit success via simpler strategies. We introduce a diagnostic suite combining statistically grounded performance comparisons and information-theoretic probes to audit the behavioural complexity of baseline policies (IPPO and MAPPO) across 37 scenarios spanning MPE, SMAX, Overcooked, Hanabi, and MaBrax. Our diagnostics reveal that success on these benchmarks rarely requires genuine Dec-POMDP reasoning. Reactive policies match the performance of memory-based agents in over half the scenarios, and emergent coordination frequently relies on brittle, synchronous action coupling rather than robust temporal influence. These findings suggest that some widely used benchmarks may not adequately test core Dec-POMDP assumptions under current training paradigms, potentially leading to over-optimistic assessments of progress.

In this work, we propose Graph Semantic Predictive Network (GraSPNet), a hierarchical self-supervised framework that explicitly models both atomic-level and fragment-level semantics. GraSPNet decomposes molecular graphs into chemically meaningful fragments without predefined vocabularies and learns node- and fragment-level representations through multi-level message passing with masked semantic prediction at both levels. This hierarchical semantic supervision enables GraSPNet to learn multi-resolution structural information that is both expressive and transferable. Extensive experiments on multiple molecular property prediction benchmarks demonstrate that GraSPNet learns chemically meaningful representations and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GSSL methods in transfer learning settings."}

In AlphaZero, prior work Go-Exploit applies this idea by sampling past states from self-play or search trees, but it treats all states equally, regardless of their learning potential. We propose Regret-Guided Search Control (RGSC), which extends AlphaZero with a regret network that learns to identify high-regret states, where the agent's evaluation diverges most from the actual outcome.

Existing RAG evaluation frameworks are primarily designed for benchmark-style or single-turn settings and often fail to capture enterprise-specific failure modes such as case misidentification, workflow misalignment, and partial resolution across turns.\n  We present a case-aware LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework for enterprise multi-turn RAG systems. The framework evaluates each turn using eight operationally grounded metrics that separate retrieval quality, grounding fidelity, answer utility, precision integrity, and case/workflow alignment. A severity-aware scoring protocol reduces score inflation and improves diagnostic clarity across heterogeneous enterprise cases. The system uses deterministic prompting with strict JSON outputs, enabling scalable batch evaluation, regression testing, and production monitoring.\n  Through a comparative study of two instruction-tuned models across short and long workflows, we show that generic proxy metrics provide ambiguous signals, while the proposed framework exposes enterprise-critical tradeoffs that are actionable for system improvement."}

Code and visualizations at https://transcoder-adapters.github.io/", "summary": "While reasoning models are increasingly ubiquitous, the effects of reasoning training on a model's internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce transcoder adapters, a technique for learning an interpretable approximation of the difference in MLP computation before and after fine-tuning. We apply transcoder adapters to characterize the differences between Qwen2.5-Math-7B and its reasoning-distilled variant, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B. Learned adapters are faithful to the target model's internal computation and next-token predictions. When evaluated on reasoning benchmarks, adapters match the reasoning model's response lengths and typically recover 50-90% of the accuracy gains from reasoning fine-tuning. Adapter features are sparsely activating and interpretable. When examining adapter features, we find that only ~8% have activating examples directly related to reasoning behaviors. We deeply study one such behavior -- the production of hesitation tokens (e.g., \"wait\"). Using attribution graphs, we trace hesitation to only ~2.4% of adapter features (5.6k total) performing one of two functions. These features are necessary and sufficient for producing hesitation tokens; removing them reduces response length, often without affecting accuracy. Overall, our results provide insight into reasoning training and suggest transcoder adapters may be useful for studying fine-tuning more broadly."}

Although techniques from both paradigms have been shown to improve model accuracy on a wide variety of tasks, we argue that the datasets used for these evaluations could cause overoptimistic evaluation results. Unlike many real-world datasets, they often (1) have no features with more salience than truthfulness, (2) have balanced training sets, and (3) contain only data points to which the model can give a well-defined answer. We construct datasets that lack each of these properties to stress-test a range of standard unsupervised elicitation and easy-to-hard generalization techniques. We find that no technique reliably performs well on any of these challenges. We also study ensembling and combining easy-to-hard and unsupervised techniques, and find they only partially mitigate performance degradation due to these challenges. We believe that overcoming these challenges should be a priority for future work on unsupervised elicitation."}

A common method is to freeze a pre-trained model and train a new, lightweight adapter for each task. While this prevents forgetting, it treats the learned knowledge as a simple, unstructured collection and fails to use the relationships between tasks. To this end, we propose the Semantic-guided Adaptive Expert Forest (SAEF), a new method that organizes adapters into a structured hierarchy for better knowledge sharing. SAEF first groups tasks into conceptual clusters based on their semantic relationships. Then, within each cluster, it builds a balanced expert tree by creating new adapters from merging the adapters of similar tasks. At inference time, SAEF finds and activates a set of relevant experts from the forest for any given input. The final prediction is made by combining the outputs of these activated experts, weighted by how confident each expert is. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that SAEF achieves SOTA performance."}

Drawing on cognitive psychology, we identify (both theoretically and empirically) two mechanisms undermining LLM idea diversity. First, at the individual level, LLMs exhibit fixation just as humans do, where early outputs constrain subsequent ideation. Second, at the collective level, LLMs aggregate knowledge into a unified distribution rather than exhibiting the knowledge partitioning inherent to human populations, where each person occupies a distinct region of the knowledge space. Through four studies, we demonstrate that targeted prompting interventions can address each mechanism independently: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting reduces fixation by encouraging structured reasoning (only in LLMs, not humans), while ordinary personas (versus \"creative entrepreneurs\" such as Steve Jobs) improve knowledge partitioning by serving as diverse sampling cues, anchoring generation in distinct regions of the semantic space. Combining both approaches produces the highest idea diversity, outperforming humans. These findings offer a theoretically grounded framework for understanding LLM idea diversity and practical strategies for human-AI collaborations that leverage AI's efficiency without compromising the diversity essential to a healthy innovation ecosystem."}

However, EHRs are often sparse and contain missing data due to various challenges and limitations in data collection and sharing between healthcare providers. Existing techniques for imputing missing values predominantly focus on known unknowns, such as missing or unavailable values of lab test results; most do not explicitly address situations where it is difficult to distinguish what is missing. For instance, a missing diagnosis code in an EHR could signify either that the patient has not been diagnosed with the condition or that a diagnosis was made, but not shared by a provider. Such situations fall into the paradigm of unknown unknowns. To address this challenge, we develop a general purpose algorithm for denoising data to recover unknown missing values in binary EHRs. We design a transformer-based denoising neural network where the output is thresholded adaptively to recover values in cases where we predict data are missing. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy in denoising medical codes within a real EHR dataset compared to existing imputation approaches and leads to increased performance on downstream tasks using the denoised data. In particular, when applying our method to a real world application, predicting hospital readmission from EHRs, our method achieves statistically significant improvement over all existing baselines."}

Prior studies have explored EEG-based classification of objects or concepts, often for passive viewing of briefly presented image or video stimuli, with limited classes. Because EEG exhibits a low signal-to-noise ratio, recognizing fine-grained representations across a large number of classes remains challenging; however, abstract-level object representations may exist. In this work, we investigate whether EEG captures object representations across multiple hierarchical levels, and propose episodic analysis, in which a Machine Learning (ML) model is evaluated across various, yet related, classification tasks (episodes). Unlike prior episodic EEG studies that rely on fixed or randomly sampled classes of equal cardinality, we adopt hierarchy-aware episode sampling using WordNet to generate episodes with variable classes of diverse hierarchy. We also present the largest episodic framework in the EEG domain for detecting observed text from EEG signals in the PEERS dataset, comprising $931538$ EEG samples under $1610$ object labels, acquired from $264$ human participants (subjects) performing controlled cognitive tasks, enabling the study of neural dynamics underlying perception, decision-making, and performance monitoring.\n  We examine how the semantic abstraction level affects classification performance across multiple learning techniques and architectures, providing a comprehensive analysis. The models tend to improve performance when the classification categories are drawn from higher levels of the hierarchy, suggesting sensitivity to abstraction. Our work highlights abstraction depth as an underexplored dimension of EEG decoding and motivates future research in this direction."}

However, protein language has key differences from natural language, such as a rich functional space despite a vocabulary of only 20 amino acids. These differences motivate research into how transformer-based architectures operate differently in the protein domain and how we can better leverage PLMs to solve protein-related tasks. In this work, we begin by directly comparing how the distribution of information stored across layers of attention heads differs between the protein and natural language domain. Furthermore, we adapt a simple early-exit technique-originally used in the natural language domain to improve efficiency at the cost of performance-to achieve both increased accuracy and substantial efficiency gains in protein non-structural property prediction by allowing the model to automatically select protein representations from the intermediate layers of the PLMs for the specific task and protein at hand. We achieve performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 7.01 percentage points while simultaneously improving efficiency by over 10 percent across models and non-structural prediction tasks.

The performance of these optimization routines is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters (HPs), which are computationally expensive to tune for large-scale models. Maximal update parameterization $(μ$P$)$ is a set of scaling rules which aims to make the optimal HPs independent of the model size, thereby allowing the HPs tuned on a smaller (computationally cheaper) model to be transferred to train a larger, target model. Despite promising results for SGD and Adam, deriving $μ$P for other optimizers is challenging because the underlying tensor programming approach is difficult to grasp. Building on recent work that introduced spectral conditions as an alternative to tensor programs, we propose a novel framework to derive $μ$P for a broader class of optimizers, including AdamW, ADOPT, LAMB, Sophia, Shampoo and Muon. We implement our $μ$P derivations on multiple benchmark models and demonstrate zero-shot learning rate transfer across increasing model width for the above optimizers.

Pruning techniques affirmed themselves as valid tools to extract sparse representations of neural networks parameters, carefully balancing between compression and preservation of information. However, a fundamental assumption behind pruning is that expendable weights should have small impact on the error of the network, while highly important weights should tend to have a larger influence on the inference. We argue that this idea could be generalized; what if a weight is not simply removed but also compensated with a perturbation of the adjacent bias, which does not contribute to the network sparsity? Our work introduces a novel pruning method in which the importance measure of each weight is computed considering the output behavior after an optimal perturbation of its adjacent bias, efficiently computable by automatic differentiation. These perturbations can be then applied directly after the removal of each weight, independently of each other. After deriving analytical expressions for the aforementioned quantities, numerical experiments are conducted to benchmark this technique against some of the most popular pruning strategies, demonstrating an intrinsic efficiency of the proposed approach in very diverse machine learning scenarios. Finally, our findings are discussed and the theoretical implications of our results are presented."}

We present Wilson Score Kernel Density Classification, which is a novel kernel-based method for estimating confidence bounds in binary classification. The core of our method is the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator, which is a function estimator for estimating confidence bounds in Binomial experiments with conditionally varying success probabilities. Our method is evaluated in the context of selective classification on four different datasets, illustrating its use as a classification head of any feature extractor, including vision foundation models.

The law of robustness states that overparameterization is necessary for models to interpolate robustly; in particular, robust interpolation requires the learned function to be Lipschitz. Robust generalization asks whether small robust training loss implies small robust test loss. We resolve this problem by explicitly connecting the two for arbitrary data distributions. Specifically, we introduce a nontrivial notion of robust generalization error and convert it into a lower bound on the expected Rademacher complexity of the induced robust loss class. Our bounds recover the $Ω(n^{1/d})$ regime of Wu et al.\\ (2023) and show that, up to constants, robust generalization does not change the order of the Lipschitz constant required for smooth interpolation. We conduct experiments to probe the predicted scaling with dataset size and model capacity, testing whether empirical behavior aligns more closely with the predictions of Bubeck and Sellke (2021) or Wu et al.\\ (2023). For MNIST, we find that the lower-bound Lipschitz constant scales on the order predicted by Wu et al.\\ (2023). Informally, to obtain low robust generalization error, the Lipschitz constant must lie in a range that we bound, and the allowable perturbation radius is linked to the Lipschitz scale."}

However, existing methods suffer from expensive training cost or rely on global correlation assumptions that often fail in practice to capture how fidelity relationships vary across the input space, leading to poor performance particularly under tight budget constraints. We introduce MAST, a method that blends corrected low-fidelity observations with high-fidelity predictions, trusting high-fidelity near observed samples and relying on corrected low-fidelity elsewhere. MAST achieves this through explicit discrepancy modelling and distance-based weighting with closed-form variance propagation, producing a single heteroscedastic Gaussian process. Across multi-fidelity synthetic benchmarks, MAST shows a marked improvement over the current state-of-the-art techniques.

Existing methods suffer from suboptimal performance as corrupted temporal features hinder effective cross-variable information transfer, amplifying reconstruction errors. Robust imputation requires both extracting temporal patterns from sparse observations within each variable and selectively transferring information across variables--yet current approaches excel at one while compromising the other. We introduce T1 (Time series imputation with 1-to-1 channel-head binding), a CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture that achieves robust imputation through Channel-Head Binding--a mechanism creating one-to-one correspondence between CNN channels and attention heads. This design enables selective information transfer: when missingness corrupts certain temporal patterns, their corresponding attention pathways adaptively down-weight based on remaining observable patterns while preserving reliable cross-variable connections through unaffected channels. Experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that T1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE by 46% on average compared to the second-best baseline, with particularly strong gains under extreme sparsity (70% missing ratio).

In this work, we develop the regexes and rules (R&R) detector suite to detect email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses, which outperforms the best regex-based PI detectors. On a manually curated set of 483 instances of PI, we measure memorization: finding that 13.6% are parroted verbatim by the Pythia-6.9b model, i.e., when the model is prompted with the tokens that precede the PI in the original document, greedy decoding generates the entire PI span exactly. We expand this analysis to study models of varying sizes (160M-6.9B) and pretraining time steps (70k-143k iterations) in the Pythia model suite and find that both model size and amount of pretraining are positively correlated with memorization. Even the smallest model, Pythia-160m, parrots 2.7% of the instances exactly. Consequently, we strongly recommend that pretraining datasets be aggressively filtered and anonymized to minimize PI parroting."}

This research introduces a transformative framework for generating large-scale urban mobility trajectories, employing a novel application of a transformer-based model pre-trained and fine-tuned through a two-phase process. Initially, trajectory generation is conceptualized as an offline reinforcement learning (RL) problem, with a significant reduction in vocabulary space achieved during tokenization. The integration of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) allows for the capture of trajectory-wise reward signals, leveraging historical data to infer individual mobility preferences. Subsequently, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned using the constructed reward model, effectively addressing the challenges inherent in traditional RL-based autoregressive methods, such as long-term credit assignment and handling of sparse reward environments. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets illustrate that our framework markedly surpasses existing models in terms of reliability and diversity.

In FSSL, data heterogeneity is a challenging issue, which exists both across clients and within clients. External heterogeneity refers to the data distribution discrepancy across different clients, while internal heterogeneity represents the mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data within clients. Most FSSL methods typically design fixed or dynamic parameter aggregation strategies to collect client knowledge on the server (external) and / or filter out low-confidence unlabeled samples to reduce mistakes in local client (internal). But, the former is hard to precisely fit the ideal global distribution via direct weights, and the latter results in fewer data participation into FL training. To this end, we propose a proxy-guided framework called ProxyFL that focuses on simultaneously mitigating external and internal heterogeneity via a unified proxy. I.e., we consider the learnable weights of classifier as proxy to simulate the category distribution both locally and globally. For external, we explicitly optimize global proxy against outliers instead of direct weights; for internal, we re-include the discarded samples into training by a positive-negative proxy pool to mitigate the impact of potentially-incorrect pseudo-labels.

Building on this insight, we propose CAMEL, a confidence-gated reflection framework that performs a lightweight single-token preference decision first and selectively invokes reflection only for low-confidence instances.

While AI for Science has witnessed the transformative power of foundation models in disciplines like genomics and meteorology, urban computing remains fragmented due to \"scenario-specific\" models, which are overfitted to specific regions or tasks, hindering their generalizability. To bridge this gap and advance spatio-temporal foundation models for urban systems, we adopt scaling as the central perspective and systematically investigate two key questions: what to scale and how to scale. Grounded in first-principles analysis, we identify three critical dimensions: heterogeneity, correlation, and dynamics, aligning these principles with the fundamental scientific properties of urban spatio-temporal data. Specifically, to address heterogeneity through data scaling, we construct WorldST. This billion-scale corpus standardizes diverse physical signals, such as traffic flow and speed, from over 100 global cities into a unified data format. To enable computation scaling for modeling correlations, we introduce the MiniST unit, a novel split mechanism that discretizes continuous spatio-temporal fields into learnable computational units to unify representations of grid-based and sensor-based observations. Finally, addressing dynamics via architecture scaling, we propose UrbanFM, a minimalist self-attention architecture designed with limited inductive biases to autonomously learn dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies from massive data. Furthermore, we establish EvalST, the largest-scale urban spatio-temporal benchmark to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UrbanFM achieves remarkable zero-shot generalization across unseen cities and tasks, marking a pivotal first step toward large-scale urban spatio-temporal foundation models."}

We present SibylSense, an inference-time learning approach that adapts a frozen rubric generator through a tunable memory bank of validated rubric items. Memory is updated via verifier-based item rewards measured by reference-candidate answer discriminative gaps from a handful of examples. SibylSense alternates memory tuning with a rubric-adversarial policy update that produces rubric-satisfying candidate answers, shrinking discriminative gaps and driving the rubric generator to capture new quality dimensions.

Ski rental was one of the first problems to be studied with predictions, where a natural prediction is simply the number of ski days. But it is both more natural and potentially more powerful to think of a prediction as a distribution p-hat over the ski days. If the true number of ski days is drawn from some true (but unknown) distribution p, then we show as our main result that there is an algorithm with expected cost at most OPT + O(min(max({eta}, 1) * sqrt(b), b log b)), where OPT is the expected cost of the optimal policy for the true distribution p, b is the cost of buying, and {eta} is the Earth Mover's (Wasserstein-1) distance between p and p-hat. Note that when {eta} < o(sqrt(b)) this gives additive loss less than b (the trivial bound), and when {eta} is arbitrarily large (corresponding to an extremely inaccurate prediction) we still do not pay more than O(b log b) additive loss. An implication of these bounds is that our algorithm has consistency O(sqrt(b)) (additive loss when the prediction error is 0) and robustness O(b log b) (additive loss when the prediction error is arbitrarily large). Moreover, we do not need to assume that we know (or have any bound on) the prediction error {eta}, in contrast with previous work in robust optimization which assumes that we know this error.\n  We complement this upper bound with a variety of lower bounds showing that it is essentially tight: not only can the consistency/robustness tradeoff not be improved, but our particular loss function cannot be meaningfully improved."}

While RL agents require extensive self-play games to extract useful signals, humans often need only a few games, improving rapidly by repeatedly revisiting states where mistakes occurred. This idea, known as search control, aims to restart from valuable states rather than always from the initial state. In AlphaZero, prior work Go-Exploit applies this idea by sampling past states from self-play or search trees, but it treats all states equally, regardless of their learning potential. We propose Regret-Guided Search Control (RGSC), which extends AlphaZero with a regret network that learns to identify high-regret states, where the agent's evaluation diverges most from the actual outcome. These states are collected from both self-play trajectories and MCTS nodes, stored in a prioritized regret buffer, and reused as new starting positions. Across 9x9 Go, 10x10 Othello, and 11x11 Hex, RGSC outperforms AlphaZero and Go-Exploit by an average of 77 and 89 Elo, respectively. When training on a well-trained 9x9 Go model, RGSC further improves the win rate against KataGo from 69.3% to 78.2%, while both baselines show no improvement.

We demonstrate that SOM-VQ produces more learnable token sequences in the evaluated domains while providing an explicit navigable geometry in code space. Critically, the topological organization enables intuitive human-in-the-loop control: users can steer generation by manipulating distances in token space, achieving semantic alignment without frame-level constraints.

First, we reveal that the training process follows a two-stage paradigm: length adaptation and reasoning refinement. After that, we conduct extensive experiments (about 0.2 million GPU hours) in a unified protocol, deconstructing training prompts and rollouts, reward shaping, and optimization strategies. In particular, a key finding is to train on relatively easier prompts, ensuring the density of positive reward signals and thus avoiding the length collapse.

Specifically, we introduce a nontrivial notion of robust generalization error and convert it into a lower bound on the expected Rademacher complexity of the induced robust loss class. Our bounds recover the $Ω(n^{1/d})$ regime of Wu et al.\\ (2023) and show that, up to constants, robust generalization does not change the order of the Lipschitz constant required for smooth interpolation. We conduct experiments to probe the predicted scaling with dataset size and model capacity, testing whether empirical behavior aligns more closely with the predictions of Bubeck and Sellke (2021) or Wu et al.\\ (2023). For MNIST, we find that the lower-bound Lipschitz constant scales on the order predicted by Wu et al.\\ (2023).

Our work reframes curvature as a diagnostic probe for understanding when and why graph learning fails."}

Specifically, we focus on the prototypical task of agnostically learning halfspaces under subgaussian distributions in the smoothed model. The best known upper bound for this problem relies on $L_1$-polynomial regression and has complexity $d^{\\tilde{O}(1/σ^2) \\log(1/ε)}$, where $σ$ is the smoothing parameter and $ε$ is the excess error. Our main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound providing formal evidence that this upper bound is close to best possible. In more detail, we show that (even for Gaussian marginals) any SQ algorithm for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces requires complexity $d^{Ω(1/σ^{2}+\\log(1/ε))}$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound on the complexity of this task and nearly matches the known upper bound. Roughly speaking, we show that applying $L_1$-polynomial regression to a smoothed version of the function is essentially best possible. Our techniques involve finding a moment-matching hard distribution by way of linear programming duality. This dual program corresponds exactly to finding a low-degree approximating polynomial to the smoothed version of the target function (which turns out to be the same condition required for the $L_1$-polynomial regression to work). Our explicit SQ lower bound then comes from proving lower bounds on this approximation degree for the class of halfspaces."}

The dominant approaches in this family of methods, such as Ring Attention or DeepSpeed Ulysses, enable scaling over the context dimension but do not focus on memory efficiency, which limits the sequence lengths they can support. More advanced techniques, such as Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer or activation offloading, can further extend the possible context length at the cost of training throughput. In this paper, we present UPipe, a simple yet effective context parallelism technique that performs fine-grained chunking at the attention head level. This technique significantly reduces the activation memory usage of self-attention, breaking the activation memory barrier and unlocking much longer context lengths. Our approach reduces intermediate tensor memory usage in the attention layer by as much as 87.5$\\%$ for 32B Transformers, while matching previous context parallelism techniques in terms of training speed.

Across multiple modeling approaches, predictive performance declines only modestly when limited to vitals, indicating that early physiological measurements retain substantial clinical signal. Structured ablation and interpretability analyses identify respiratory and oxygenation measures as the most influential contributors to early risk stratification, with models exhibiting stable, graceful degradation as sensing is reduced.

Their joint predictive structure at the population level remains incompletely characterized. Objectives: The study aims to identify multilevel predictors of overweight and obesity among U.S. adolescents and compare the predictive performance, calibration, and subgroup equity of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Data and Methods: We analyze 18,792 children aged 10-17 years from the 2021 National Survey of Children's Health. Overweight/obesity is defined using BMI categories. Predictors included diet, physical activity, sleep, parental stress, socioeconomic conditions, adverse experiences, and neighborhood characteristics. Models include logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, multilayer perceptron, and TabNet. Performance is evaluated using AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Brier score. Results: Discrimination range from 0.66 to 0.79. Logistic regression, gradient boosting, and MLP showed the most stable balance of discrimination and calibration. Boosting and deep learning modestly improve recall and F1 score. No model was uniformly superior. Performance disparities across race and poverty groups persist across algorithms. Conclusion: Increased model complexity yields limited gains over logistic regression. Predictors consistently span behavioral, household, and neighborhood domains. Persistent subgroup disparities indicate the need for improved data quality and equity-focused surveillance rather than greater algorithmic complexity."}

Existing artificial intelligence approaches typically optimize individual components of phenotyping but do not operationalize the full clinical workflow of extracting features from clinical text, standardizing them to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, and prioritizing diagnostically informative HPO terms. We developed RARE-PHENIX, an end-to-end AI framework for rare disease phenotyping that integrates large language model-based phenotype extraction, ontology-grounded standardization to HPO terms, and supervised ranking of diagnostically informative phenotypes. We trained RARE-PHENIX using data from 2,671 patients across 11 Undiagnosed Diseases Network clinical sites, and externally validated it on 16,357 real-world clinical notes from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Using clinician-curated HPO terms as the gold standard, RARE-PHENIX consistently outperformed a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline (PhenoBERT) across ontology-based similarity and precision-recall-F1 metrics in end-to-end evaluation (i.e., ontology-based similarity of 0.70 vs. 0.58). Ablation analyses demonstrated performance improvements with the addition of each module in RARE-PHENIX (extraction, standardization, and prioritization), supporting the value of modeling the full clinical phenotyping workflow. By modeling phenotyping as a clinically aligned workflow rather than a single extraction task, RARE-PHENIX provides structured, ranked phenotypes that are more concordant with clinician curation and has the potential to support human-in-the-loop rare disease diagnosis in real-world settings."}

The dearth of studies focusing on hallucinations in closed-source models is especially concerning, as they constitute the vast majority of models in institutional deployments. We introduce QueryBandits, a model-agnostic contextual bandit framework that adaptively learns online to select the optimal query-rewrite strategy by leveraging an empirically validated and calibrated reward function. Across 16 QA scenarios, our top QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a No-Rewrite baseline and outperforms zero-shot static policies (e.g., Paraphrase or Expand) by 42.6% and 60.3%, respectively. Moreover, all contextual bandits outperform vanilla bandits across all datasets, with higher feature variance coinciding with greater variance in arm selection. This substantiates our finding that there is no single rewrite policy optimal for all queries. We also discover that certain static policies incur higher cumulative regret than No-Rewrite, indicating that an inflexible query-rewriting policy can worsen hallucinations. Thus, learning an online policy over semantic features with QueryBandits can shift model behavior purely through forward-pass mechanisms, enabling its use with closed-source models and bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation."}

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations. We open source our code and provide pre-trained MIMIC agents and qualitative demos at: https://mimic-research.github.io."}

In this work, we develop the regexes and rules (R&R) detector suite to detect email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses, which outperforms the best regex-based PI detectors. On a manually curated set of 483 instances of PI, we measure memorization: finding that 13.6% are parroted verbatim by the Pythia-6.9b model, i.e., when the model is prompted with the tokens that precede the PI in the original document, greedy decoding generates the entire PI span exactly. We expand this analysis to study models of varying sizes (160M-6.9B) and pretraining time steps (70k-143k iterations) in the Pythia model suite and find that both model size and amount of pretraining are positively correlated with memorization. Even the smallest model, Pythia-160m, parrots 2.7% of the instances exactly. Consequently, we strongly recommend that pretraining datasets be aggressively filtered and anonymized to minimize PI parroting."}

Several celebrated results in statistical learning theory, such as the VC theorem and Littlestone's characterization of online learnability, establish conditions on the hypothesis class that allow for learning under independent data and adversarial data, respectively. Building upon recent work bridging these extremes, we study sequential decision making under distributional adversaries that can adaptively choose data-generating distributions from a fixed family $U$ and ask when such problems are learnable with sample complexity that behaves like the favorable independent case. We provide a near complete characterization of families $U$ that admit learnability in terms of a notion known as generalized smoothness i.e. a distribution family admits VC-dimension-dependent regret bounds for every finite-VC hypothesis class if and only if it is generalized smooth. Further, we give universal algorithms that achieve low regret under any generalized smooth adversary without explicit knowledge of $U$. Finally, when $U$ is known, we provide refined bounds in terms of a combinatorial parameter, the fragmentation number, that captures how many disjoint regions can carry nontrivial mass under $U$. These results provide a nearly complete understanding of learnability under distributional adversaries. In addition, building upon the surprising connection between online learning and differential privacy, we show that the generalized smoothness also characterizes private learnability under distributional constraints."}

The advent of wearable devices and related technologies has propelled the creation of health databases consisting of human movement data to conduct research on mobility patterns and health outcomes. Statistical methods for analyzing high-resolution actigraph data depend on the specific inferential context, but the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) frameworks require that the methods be congruent to transfer learning and amortization. This article devises amortized Bayesian inference for actigraph time sheets. We pursue a Bayesian approach to ensure full propagation of uncertainty and its quantification using a hierarchical dynamic linear model. We build our analysis around actigraph data from the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches in Los Angeles (PASTA-LA) study conducted by the Fielding School of Public Health in the University of California, Los Angeles. Apart from achieving probabilistic imputation of actigraph time sheets, we are also able to statistically learn about the time-varying impact of explanatory variables on the magnitude of acceleration (MAG) for a cohort of subjects."}

Unlike classical analyses that treat gradient noise as additive and localized, perturbations to intermediate outputs and gradients cascade through the computational graph, compounding geometrically with the number of operators. We present the first comprehensive theoretical analysis of this setting. Specifically, we characterize how forward and backward perturbations propagate and amplify within a single gradient step, derive convergence guarantees for both general non-convex objectives and functions satisfying the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition, and identify conditions under which perturbations do not deteriorate the asymptotic convergence order. As a byproduct, our analysis furnishes a theoretical explanation for the gradient spiking phenomenon widely observed in deep learning, precisely characterizing the conditions under which training recovers from spikes or diverges. Experiments on logistic regression with convex and non-convex regularization validate our theories, illustrating the predicted spike behavior and the asymmetric sensitivity to forward versus backward perturbations."}

Conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification of these models has risen in popularity, providing adaptive, statistically-valid prediction sets. For classification tasks, conformal methods have typically focused on utilizing logit scores. For pre-trained models, however, this can result in inefficient, overly conservative set sizes when not calibrated towards the target task. We propose DANCE, a doubly locally adaptive nearest-neighbor based conformal algorithm combining two novel nonconformity scores directly using the data's embedded representation. DANCE first fits a task-adaptive kernel regression model from the embedding layer before using the learned kernel space to produce the final prediction sets for uncertainty quantification. We test against state-of-the-art local, task-adapted and zero-shot conformal baselines, demonstrating DANCE's superior blend of set size efficiency and robustness across various datasets."}

Rubrics provide structured, interpretable supervision, but scaling rubric construction is difficult: expert rubrics are costly, prompted rubrics are often superficial or inconsistent, and fixed-pool discriminative rubrics can saturate and drift, enabling reward hacking. We present SibylSense, an inference-time learning approach that adapts a frozen rubric generator through a tunable memory bank of validated rubric items. Memory is updated via verifier-based item rewards measured by reference-candidate answer discriminative gaps from a handful of examples. SibylSense alternates memory tuning with a rubric-adversarial policy update that produces rubric-satisfying candidate answers, shrinking discriminative gaps and driving the rubric generator to capture new quality dimensions. Experiments on two open-ended tasks show that SibylSense yields more discriminative rubrics and improves downstream RL performance over static and non-adaptive baselines."}

Traditional KL divergence tends to be dominated by the next tokens with the highest probabilities, i.e., the teacher's modes, thereby diminishing the influence of less probable yet potentially informative components of the output distribution. We propose a new tail-aware divergence that decouples the contribution of the teacher model's top-K predicted probabilities from that of lower-probability predictions, while maintaining the same computational profile as the KL Divergence. Our decoupled approach reduces the impact of the teacher modes and, consequently, increases the contribution of the tail of the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our modified distillation method yields competitive performance in both pre-training and supervised distillation of decoder models across various datasets. Furthermore, the distillation process is efficient and can be performed with a modest academic budget for large datasets, eliminating the need for industry-scale computing."}

Given $k$ data sources, the goal is to output a classifier for each source by exploiting shared structure to reduce sample complexity. We focus on the bounded label noise setting to determine whether the fast $1/ε$ rates achievable in single-task learning extend to this regime with minimal dependence on $k$. Surprisingly, we show that this is not the case. We demonstrate that learning across $k$ distributions inherently incurs slow rates scaling with $k/ε^2$, even under constant noise levels, unless each distribution is learned separately. A key technical contribution is a structured hypothesis-testing framework that captures the statistical cost of certifying near-optimality under bounded noise-a cost we show is unavoidable in the multi-distribution setting.\n  Finally, we prove that when competing with the stronger benchmark of each distribution's optimal Bayes error, the sample complexity incurs a \\textit{multiplicative} penalty in $k$. This establishes a \\textit{statistical} separation between random classification noise and Massart noise, highlighting a fundamental barrier unique to learning from multiple sources."}

Inspired by the interplay of emotions and cognition in the human brain and more specifically the SEEKING motivational state, we design a dual-model framework where a smaller base model is trained continuously, while a larger motivated model is activated intermittently during predefined \"motivation conditions\". The framework mimics the emotional state of high curiosity and anticipation of reward in which broader brain regions are recruited to enhance cognitive performance. Exploiting scalable architectures where larger models extend smaller ones, our method enables shared weight updates and selective expansion of network capacity during noteworthy training steps. Empirical evaluation on the image classification task demonstrates that, not only does the alternating training scheme efficiently and effectively enhance the base model compared to a traditional scheme, in some cases, the motivational model also surpasses its standalone counterpart despite seeing less data per epoch. This opens the possibility of simultaneously training two models tailored to different deployment constraints with competitive or superior performance while keeping training cost lower than when training the larger model."}

The original algorithm uses linear combinations of variables in a tree structure where depth is constrained to be less than the number of classes -- a limitation that proves too rigid for complex classification problems. Our extensions improve performance in multi-class settings with unequal variance-covariance structures and nonlinear class separations by allowing more splits and more flexible class groupings in the projection pursuit computation. Proposing algorithmic improvements is straightforward; demonstrating their actual utility is not. We therefore develop two visual diagnostic approaches to verify that the enhancements perform as intended. Using high-dimensional visualization techniques, we examine model fits on benchmark datasets to assess whether the algorithm behaves as theorized. An interactive web application enables users to explore the behavior of both the original and enhanced classifiers under controlled scenarios.

For non-accelerated local methods, the best known worst-case work scales as $\\widetilde{O} ((αρ)^{-1})$, where $α$ is the teleportation parameter and $ρ$ is the $\\ell_1$-regularization parameter. A natural question is whether FISTA can improve the dependence on $α$ from $1/α$ to $1/\\sqrtα$ while preserving the $1/ρ$ locality scaling. The challenge is that acceleration can break locality by transiently activating nodes that are zero at optimality, thereby increasing the cost of gradient evaluations. We analyze FISTA on a slightly over-regularized objective and show that, under a checkable confinement condition, all spurious activations remain inside a boundary set $\\mathcal{B}$.

To address this, we introduce DEEPSYNTH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agents on realistic, time-consuming problems that combine information gathering, synthesis, and structured reasoning to produce insights. DEEPSYNTH contains 120 tasks collected across 7 domains and data sources covering 67 countries. DEEPSYNTH is constructed using a multi-stage data collection pipeline that requires annotators to collect official data sources, create hypotheses, perform manual analysis, and design tasks with verifiable answers.

Stephens"], "title": "Not Just How Much, But Where: Decomposing Epistemic Uncertainty into Per-Class Contributions", "comment": "8 pages, 17 figures", "summary": "In safety-critical classification, the cost of failure is often asymmetric, yet Bayesian deep learning summarises epistemic uncertainty with a single scalar, mutual information (MI), that cannot distinguish whether a model's ignorance involves a benign or safety-critical class. We decompose MI into a per-class vector $C_k(x)=σ_k^{2}/(2μ_k)$, with $μ_k{=}\\mathbb{E}[p_k]$ and $σ_k^2{=}\\mathrm{Var}[p_k]$ across posterior samples. The decomposition follows from a second-order Taylor expansion of the entropy; the $1/μ_k$ weighting corrects boundary suppression and makes $C_k$ comparable across rare and common classes. By construction $\\sum_k C_k \\approx \\mathrm{MI}$, and a companion skewness diagnostic flags inputs where the approximation degrades. After characterising the axiomatic properties of $C_k$, we validate it on three tasks: (i) selective prediction for diabetic retinopathy, where critical-class $C_k$ reduces selective risk by 34.7\\% over MI and 56.2\\% over variance baselines; (ii) out-of-distribution detection on clinical and image benchmarks, where $\\sum_k C_k$ achieves the highest AUROC and the per-class view exposes asymmetric shifts invisible to MI; and (iii) a controlled label-noise study in which $\\sum_k C_k$ shows less sensitivity to injected aleatoric noise than MI under end-to-end Bayesian training, while both metrics degrade under transfer learning. Across all tasks, the quality of the posterior approximation shapes uncertainty at least as strongly as the choice of metric, suggesting that how uncertainty is propagated through the network matters as much as how it is measured."}
