Correspondence:\n  yw676@duke.edu", "summary": "We present a novel enhanced cyclic coordinate descent (ECCD) framework for\nsolving generalized linear models with elastic net constraints that reduces\ntraining time in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods. We redesign\nthe CD method by performing a Taylor expansion around the current iterate to\navoid nonlinear operations arising in the gradient computation. By introducing\nthis approximation, we are able to unroll the vector recurrences occurring in\nthe CD method and reformulate the resulting computations into more efficient\nbatched computations. We show empirically that the recurrence can be unrolled\nby a tunable integer parameter, $s$, such that $s > 1$ yields performance\nimprovements without affecting convergence, whereas $s = 1$ yields the original\nCD method. A key advantage of ECCD is that it avoids the convergence delay and\nnumerical instability exhibited by block coordinate descent. Finally, we\nimplement our proposed method in C++ using Eigen to accelerate linear algebra\ncomputations. Comparison of our method against existing state-of-the-art\nsolvers shows consistent performance improvements of $3\\times$ in average for\nregularization path variant on diverse benchmark datasets.

Our analysis\nreveals substantial domain dependent variation in self-reflection\neffectiveness, with performance gains up to 220\\% in mathematical reasoning. We\nfurther investigate how reflection round depth and feedback mechanism quality\ninfluence performance across model families. To validate our findings in a\nreal-world setting, we deploy a self-reflection enhanced marketing content\nlocalisation system at Lounge by Zalando, where it shows market-dependent\neffectiveness, reinforcing the importance of domain specific evaluation when\ndeploying these techniques. Our results provide actionable guidance for\nselecting optimal inference strategies given specific domains and resource\nconstraints. We open source our self-reflection implementation for\nreproducibility at\nhttps://github.com/aws-samples/sample-genai-reflection-for-bedrock."}

Incorporating these\ndecisions into optimal power flow (OPF) results in mixed-integer non-linear\nprogramming problems (MINLPs), which can't presently be solved at scale in the\nrequired time. Various linearizations of the OPF exist, most famously the\nDC-OPF, which can be leveraged to find integer decisions. However, these\nlinearizations can yield very poor integer solutions in some edge cases, making\nthem challenging to incorporate into control rooms. This paper introduces the\nuse of modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) to find alternative solutions to\nthe linearized problems, reducing the chance of finding no AC feasible\nsolutions. We test this approach using 13 networks where the DC linearization\nresults in infeasible integer decisions, and MGA finds a solution in all cases.\nThe MGA search criteria selected drastically affects the number and quality of\nsolutions found, so network specific search functions may be necessary."}

To overcome these\nissues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM\ncapabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are\ninherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes\nevaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the\naforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through\nDixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that\ntrick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our\nquantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are\nperfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between\nhuman and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent\nstrategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning."}

The rise of\ngenerative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced\nnew methods for committing fraud at scale.

However, without proper traffic handling strategy, it is still\ndifficult to effectively meet the low-latency requirements. In this paper, we\nconsider a cooperative satellite-aerial-MIoT network (CSAMN) for maritime edge\ncomputing and maritime data storage to prioritize delay-sensitive (DS) tasks by\nemploying mobile edge computing, while handling delay-tolerant (DT) tasks via\nthe store-carry-forward method. Considering the delay constraints of DS tasks,\nwe formulate a constrained joint optimization problem of maximizing\nsatellite-collected data volume while minimizing system energy consumption by\ncontrolling four interdependent variables, including the transmit power of UAVs\nfor DS tasks, the start time of DT tasks, computing resource allocation, and\noffloading ratio. To solve this non-convex and non-linear problem, we propose a\njoint computation offloading and resource management (JCORM) algorithm using\nthe Dinkelbach method and linear programming. Our results show that the volume\nof data collected by the proposed JCORM algorithm can be increased by up to\n41.5% compared to baselines.

Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve\nvalue-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:\nconcise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate\nthis behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on\nend-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to\nvalue alignment.

In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that\nthe forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the\nforecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods\ntypically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply\na reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values\nare coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal\nreconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,\nhowever, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from\nfinite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance\nmatrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a\nrobust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for\nuncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix.

Extensive experiments on\nfour benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the\neffectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can\nachieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,\nwith negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies\nfurther reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training\nrather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in\nlatent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious\nrisks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need\nfor robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models."}

We evaluate two control\nstrategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic\nagent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action\nmasking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to\nlearn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When\naction masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the\nperformance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role\nof action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization\ndiminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides\na valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions\nin industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on\ncentralization versus specialization."}

Our analysis shows\nthat Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong\nrule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by\nconsistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the\ntraining data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.\nIn a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including\nChess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions\nof pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy\nadaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit\nsearch, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the\ntraining dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own\npieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game."}

While these methods improve output quality, they create\ncomplex trade-offs among accuracy, cost, and latency that remain poorly\nunderstood across different domains. This paper systematically compares\nself-reflection and budget tuning across mathematical reasoning and translation\ntasks. We evaluate prominent LLMs, including Anthropic Claude, Amazon Nova, and\nMistral families, along with other models under varying reflection depths and\ncompute budgets to derive Pareto optimal performance frontiers. Our analysis\nreveals substantial domain dependent variation in self-reflection\neffectiveness, with performance gains up to 220\\% in mathematical reasoning. We\nfurther investigate how reflection round depth and feedback mechanism quality\ninfluence performance across model families. To validate our findings in a\nreal-world setting, we deploy a self-reflection enhanced marketing content\nlocalisation system at Lounge by Zalando, where it shows market-dependent\neffectiveness, reinforcing the importance of domain specific evaluation when\ndeploying these techniques. Our results provide actionable guidance for\nselecting optimal inference strategies given specific domains and resource\nconstraints.

We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel\nrepresentations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates\nat fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where\nuncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination\nprobability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \\leq\nf(\\sigma^2((1-\\rho(P))/P + \\rho(P)), \\mu^2)$, which predicts that language\nmodels need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce\nND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA\nadapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces\nhallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general\naccuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,\ncausal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and\ncorrelational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is\nassociated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent\noptimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal\nneurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third\naxis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the\nreliability of language models at fixed budgets."}

While elegant, this definition assumes\n\\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset\nfailure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect\n\\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential\ndomains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of\ngeneralized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This\nformulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the\nresulting \\textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under\nvarying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards\nspecialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain\ndependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,\nthe coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general\ncompetence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\\%). Integrating\nthe generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter\nfoundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI."}

Particularly,\nwe propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with\nsliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates\ninformation from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a\nlimited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's\nconstant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse\nattention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive\nbenchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches."}
