TL;DR: 本文研究自动归因方法，将摘要中的每个句子链接到源文本的特定部分，探索使用混合摘要（自动改写抽取式摘要）来简化归因过程，并使用自定义拓扑识别不同类别归因相关错误的比例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析师需要归因，因为不知道信息来源就无法进行报道。自动归因方法对于将摘要句子链接到源文本至关重要。

Method: 使用混合摘要方法（自动改写抽取式摘要），并采用自定义拓扑来识别归因相关错误的类别和比例。

Result: 通过混合摘要方法简化了归因过程，自定义拓扑能够有效识别不同类别的归因相关错误。

Conclusion: 混合摘要方法有助于自动归因，自定义拓扑为归因错误的分类和分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Analysts require attribution, as nothing can be reported without knowing the source of the information. In this paper, we will focus on automatic methods for attribution, linking each sentence in the summary to a portion of the source text, which may be in one or more documents. We explore using a hybrid summarization, i.e., an automatic paraphrase of an extractive summary, to ease attribution. We also use a custom topology to identify the proportion of different categories of attribution-related errors.

### [2] [GMTRouter: Personalized LLM Router over Multi-turn User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08590)
*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter是一个基于异构图学习的个性化LLM路由框架，能够从少量数据中学习用户偏好，在多个数据集上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法缺乏完全个性化，无法捕捉用户与LLM之间的复杂交互关系，且用户偏好数据通常稀缺、噪声大、格式不一致。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互建模为包含用户、LLM、查询和响应四种节点的异构图，通过定制化的消息传递机制在轻量级归纳图学习框架中学习用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集上，GMTRouter比基线方法准确率提高0.9-21.6%，AUC提高0.006-0.309，且仅需少量数据即可适应新用户和演化偏好。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过图神经网络有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化挑战，能够在数据稀缺情况下实现高效个性化路由。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs能生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话，39%的情况下被误认为是人类创作，其中Llama 3生成的对话仅有56%被正确识别为AI生成，接近随机概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs模拟社交媒体群组对话的有效性，验证其能否真实模拟人类对话，为社交模拟应用提供基础。

Method: 收集Reddit真实人类对话，使用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o生成相同主题的人工对话，通过参与者侧向比较识别真伪。

Result: LLM生成的对话有39%被误认为是人类创作，Llama 3生成的对话仅有56%被正确识别为AI生成，接近50%的随机概率。

Conclusion: LLMs能生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话欺骗人类读者，既展示了社交模拟的潜力，也警示了生成虚假社交媒体内容的潜在风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

### [4] [Knowledge Graph Analysis of Legal Understanding and Violations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08593)
*Abha Jha,Abel Salinas,Fred Morstatter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在法律分析中的双重性：既能解读复杂的法律框架（如美国法典第18篇第175条关于生物武器的规定），又存在生成不安全内容的漏洞。作者提出结合知识图谱和检索增强生成的方法来评估LLM的法律理解能力、意图判断和安全隐患。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在法律领域具有变革潜力，但存在矛盾：它们能分析法律，却也可能生成危险的生物武器制造指导。需要系统评估LLM在敏感法律领域的理解能力和安全风险。

Method: 采用知识图谱构建与检索增强生成(RAG)相结合的方法，通过结构化实验评估LLM识别法律违规、生成禁止性指令和检测非法意图的能力。

Result: 研究发现LLM在法律推理和安全机制方面存在显著局限性，但通过增强安全协议和更强大的法律推理框架可以改善。

Conclusion: 通过结合改进的安全协议和更强大的法律推理框架，本研究为开发能够在敏感法律领域提供伦理和安全协助的LLM奠定了基础，确保它们成为法律的保护者而非无意中的违反者。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

### [5] [Diverse Preference Learning for Capabilities and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08594)
*Stewart Slocum,Asher Parker-Sartori,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM对齐算法（如RLHF和DPO）显著降低输出多样性，作者提出Soft Preference Learning方法，通过解耦KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，精细控制生成多样性，在能力和对齐方面均有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐算法过度减少模型输出的多样性，导致文本结构重复、解决问题方式单一、社会视角狭窄，这主要源于KL散度正则化使模型过度重视多数意见。

Method: 提出Soft Preference Learning方法，解构KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，实现对LLM生成多样性的精细控制。

Result: 从能力角度看，该方法在困难重复采样任务上获得更高准确率，输出具有更大语义和词汇多样性；从对齐角度看，能代表更广泛社会观点，并改善logit校准。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning是标准温度缩放的帕累托改进，能有效平衡LLM的对齐质量和输出多样性。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

### [6] [Chopping Trees: Semantic Similarity Based Dynamic Pruning for Tree-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08595)
*Joongho Kim,Xirui Huang,Zarreen Reza,Gabriel Grand,Kevin Zhu,Ryan Lagasse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSDP是一种轻量级方法，通过在线语义合并和动态剪枝，显著减少Tree-of-Thought推理中的语义冗余，实现2.3倍加速和85-90%节点减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-of-Thought推理虽然提升了LLM的问题解决能力，但由于语义冗余导致计算成本高昂，需要更高效的推理方法。

Method: 引入语义相似性动态剪枝(SSDP)，将在线语义合并集成到并行树搜索中，实时聚类和剪枝冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500等基准测试中，SSDP比最先进的树搜索基线快2.3倍，减少85-90%探索节点，准确率保持在最强基线的5%以内。

Conclusion: SSDP为高效、可扩展的LLM推理提供了一种实用方法，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.

### [7] [What About the Scene with the Hitler Reference? HAUNT: A Framework to Probe LLMs' Self-consistency Via Adversarial Nudge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08596)
*Arka Dutta,Sujan Dutta,Rijul Magu,Soumyajit Datta,Munmun De Choudhury,Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个框架来测试LLMs在对抗性提示下的真实性保真度，发现不同模型对自我生成的谎言具有不同程度的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题是LLMs在实际部署中的关键挑战，特别是在高风险领域需要测试模型对对抗性提示的鲁棒性。

Method: 框架包含三个步骤：1) 让LLM生成特定领域内的真实和虚假陈述；2) 让LLM验证这些陈述的真伪；3) 测试LLM对自身生成谎言的抵抗力。

Result: 在电影和小说两个封闭领域的测试显示：Claude表现出强韧性，GPT和Grok中等韧性，而Gemini和DeepSeek韧性较弱。

Conclusion: 随着越来越多人使用LLMs进行信息检索，这些发现敲响了警钟，表明需要提高模型对对抗性提示的抵抗力。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

### [8] [Self-HarmLLM: Can Large Language Model Harm Itself?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08597)
*Heehwan Kim,Sungjune Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-HarmLLM攻击场景，使用模型自身生成的模糊有害查询作为新输入来绕过防护机制，在多种模型和条件下实现了显著的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御假设攻击来自外部，但未充分探索模型自身输出成为攻击向量的可能性。

Method: 使用模型生成的模糊有害查询重新输入到同一模型的另一会话中，在Base、Zero-shot和Few-shot条件下进行实验。

Result: Zero-shot条件下最高52%转换成功率和33%越狱成功率；Few-shot条件下最高65%转换成功率和41%越狱成功率。自动评估高估了52%的越狱成功率。

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑防护机制设计并建立更稳健的评估方法，自动评估单独使用不准确。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

### [9] [OKBench: Democratizing LLM Evaluation with Fully Automated, On-Demand, Open Knowledge Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08598)
*Yanhong Li,Tianyang Xu,Kenan Tang,Karen Livescu,David McAllester,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OKBench是一个自动化框架，用于生成动态知识基准测试，特别关注新闻领域，以解决传统静态基准无法捕捉知识演变的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于维基百科和教科书的静态基准无法反映动态世界中的知识演变，且集中式管理难以跟上LLM的快速发展。

Method: OKBench是一个代理框架，自动化完成基准测试的获取、创建、验证和分发过程，重点关注新闻领域，减少与预训练数据的重叠。

Result: 评估了各种开源和专有LLM，结果显示模型在面对新信息时表现出不同行为，检索缩小了大小模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 在演化知识基准上评估LLM非常重要，OKBench框架使基准创建民主化，并促进检索增强方法的全面评估。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了Mina，一个面向孟加拉国背景的多语言法律助手，在孟加拉律师资格考试中表现优异，达到75-80%的分数，匹配或超越人类平均水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决孟加拉国低收入人群因复杂法律语言、程序不透明和高成本而难以获得负担得起的法律咨询的问题。现有AI法律助手缺乏孟加拉语支持和特定司法管辖区适应。

Method: 采用多语言嵌入和基于RAG的工具链框架，实现检索、推理、翻译和文档生成，通过交互式聊天界面提供情境感知的法律草案、引用和平实语言解释。

Result: 在2022和2023年孟加拉律师资格考试的所有阶段评估中，Mina在初步多选题、笔试和模拟口试中获得75-80%的分数，匹配或超越人类平均表现。

Conclusion: Mina展示了作为低成本、多语言AI助手的潜力，能够自动化关键法律任务并扩大司法可及性，为构建领域特定、低资源系统提供了现实案例研究。

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

### [11] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Pediatric Speech-Language Pathology vignettes: A Proof-of-Concept Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08600)
*Yilan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的系统，用于自动生成儿科言语语言病理学临床案例，结合领域知识库减少幻觉，支持商业和开源LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床案例是言语语言病理学教育的重要工具，但手动创建耗时费力。通用大语言模型缺乏领域专业知识，容易产生幻觉且需要大量专家修订。

Method: 构建多模型RAG系统，整合精选领域知识与工程化提示模板，支持5个商业和开源LLM，设计7个测试场景涵盖不同障碍类型和年级水平。

Result: 概念验证显示RAG增强生成儿科SLP案例的技术可行性，商业模型质量略有优势，但开源模型表现可接受，适合隐私保护部署。

Conclusion: 整合精选知识库能够生成符合专业指南的内容，未来可扩展到临床决策支持、自动IEP目标生成和临床反思训练等应用。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

### [12] [Evaluating DisCoCirc in Translation Tasks & its Limitations: A Comparative Study Between Bengali & English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08601)
*Nazmoon Falgunee Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了DisCoCirc形式化方法到孟加拉语，并应用于英-孟翻译任务，发现该框架在语言结构差异下存在局限性，与之前声称的减少语言官僚主义效果不符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将DisCoCirc形式化框架从英语扩展到孟加拉语，评估其在跨语言翻译中的有效性，特别是检验其减少语言官僚主义的能力。

Method: 基于DisCoCirc语法框架，开发孟加拉语版本，应用于英-孟翻译任务，分析框架在处理语言结构差异时的表现。

Result: DisCoCirc框架虽然对大部分语言有效，但在处理英语和孟加拉语结构差异时面临限制，即使相对简单的句子也存在困难。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc在跨语言翻译中存在局限性，与先前声称的减少语言官僚主义效果不符，需要进一步改进以处理语言结构差异问题。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

TL;DR: 研究了5个主要LLM在急诊医学诊断中的表现，构建了MEDAS超级学习器，通过元学习整合多个LLM，将诊断准确率从单个模型的58-65%提升到70%，其中单个模型最高可达85%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急诊医学需要快速准确的诊断支持系统，AI和LLM在医疗决策支持中具有重要应用价值，但单个LLM的诊断能力有限。

Method: 构建MEDAS超级学习器，集成Gemini、Llama、Grok、GPT和Claude五个主要LLM，使用元学习器学习每个LLM的不同能力，利用集体能力提升诊断准确率。

Result: 单个LLM诊断准确率在58%-65%之间，超过人类医生报告准确率；超级学习器准确率达到70%；集成模型中至少一个LLM达到85%正确诊断。

Conclusion: 通过元学习方法整合多个LLM的超级学习器能够利用集体知识，显著提升急诊医学诊断准确率，超过任何单个LLM的表现。

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在领域专业化监督微调中的资源密集问题和灾难性遗忘现象

Method: 基于梯度幅度和统计分布的自适应数据选择方法，从初步训练阶段分析梯度来识别有效训练子集

Result: 在医疗、法律、金融等多个领域实验中，仅用5%GrADS数据即可超越全数据集性能，使用50%数据时性能显著提升，同时大幅缓解灾难性遗忘

Conclusion: GrADS方法在领域专业化微调中具有显著效率和成本效益，能够有效提升模型性能并缓解灾难性遗忘

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是青少年第二大死因，过去自杀企图是未来自杀的重要预测因素。许多有自杀想法的人会在社交媒体上发出信号，需要有效的方法来识别这些模式。

Method: 采用CNN架构和双向GRU技术的混合深度学习方案，结合CNN的局部特征提取、BiGRU的双向序列建模、注意力机制和SHAP可解释性方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法达到了93.97%的准确率，优于其他最先进的机器学习和深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 提出的混合深度学习框架在自杀检测方面表现出优越性能，结合了高准确性和模型可解释性，为自杀预防提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SAGE-Agent，通过结构化不确定性建模工具调用参数，使用POMDP和EVPI目标进行最优问题选择，在模糊任务中提高覆盖率7-39%，同时减少澄清问题1.5-2.7倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在工具调用时，模糊的用户指令经常导致错误调用和任务失败，需要更有效的方法来处理不确定性

Method: 引入工具调用参数的结构化不确定性建模，将联合工具参数澄清建模为POMDP，使用EVPI目标进行最优问题选择，采用基于方面的成本建模防止冗余

Result: 在ClarifyBench基准测试中，SAGE-Agent在模糊任务中提高覆盖率7-39%，减少澄清问题1.5-2.7倍；通过不确定性加权GRPO训练，将When2Call准确率从36.5%提升到65.2%（3B模型）

Conclusion: 结构化不确定性为工具增强代理提供了原则性、高效的方法，在现实场景中同时提高了任务成功率和交互效率

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了三种NLP模型，用于从帕金森病患者的第一人称叙述中自动识别认知过程类别。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型表现最佳，在提取七个认知类别方面取得了最高F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解帕金森病患者日常生活中的认知体验描述可以提供关于疾病相关认知和情绪变化的宝贵见解，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取此类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 比较了三种模型家族：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型，以及在零样本和少样本设置下评估的GPT-4o mini模型，用于提取七个认知类别。

Result: 模型性能在不同类别和模型家族间差异显著。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct获得了最高的总体F1分数（微平均0.74，宏平均0.59），在上下文依赖类别如思维和社交互动方面表现尤为出色。Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低。

Conclusion: 尽管由于复杂认知过程叙述的抽象和重叠性质，这项任务比传统信息提取更具挑战性，但经过持续改进，这些NLP系统有望实现低负担的纵向认知功能监测，并作为帕金森病正式神经心理学评估的有价值补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了TACT数据集，用于统一任务导向对话和闲聊，支持模式切换，并通过DPO优化提升了对话质量和过渡控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话系统要么专注于任务导向对话，要么专注于闲聊，缺乏两者之间的自然过渡，而现实对话需要在这两种模式间流畅切换。

Method: 构建TACT数据集，支持用户和代理驱动的模式切换，提出Switch和Recovery评估指标，并应用Direct Preference Optimization(DPO)进行模型优化。

Result: 在TACT上训练的模型在意图检测和模式切换处理上优于基线，DPO优化后达到75.74%的联合模式-意图准确率和70.1%的人类评估胜率。

Conclusion: 结构多样化的数据与DPO结合能够提升响应质量和过渡控制，为更主动和过渡感知的对话代理铺平道路。

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

Conclusion: BioVerge为生物医学假设生成提供了标准化环境，展示了LLM代理在发现科学前沿知识方面的潜力，特别是通过多源信息整合和自评估机制能够产生更优质的假设。

Abstract: Hypothesis generation in biomedical research has traditionally centered on uncovering hidden relationships within vast scientific literature, often using methods like Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.

*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM生成文献引用的准确性与其在预训练语料中的出现频率（以引用次数为代理）密切相关，超过约1000次引用的文献几乎被逐字记忆，而引用次数少的文献更容易产生幻觉引用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在文献引用推荐中产生不存在论文的幻觉问题，探索LLM生成准确参考文献的能力与预训练数据冗余度之间的关系。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的文献引用，通过人工验证和计算生成引用与真实元数据的余弦相似度来测量事实一致性。

Result: 引用次数与事实准确性强相关；超过约1000次引用的文献信息几乎被逐字记忆；当多个高引用论文内容相似时会出现记忆干扰。

Conclusion: LLM存在从泛化到记忆的阈值，高引用论文几乎被逐字保留在模型中，这解释了引用幻觉现象与训练数据频率的关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Method: 采用推理增强范式，将过程分解为规划、执行和修订三个阶段，使用最小化任务路由提示实现零样本泛化，不依赖外部知识源或监督检测器。

Result: 在五个代表性任务上的实验表明，HalluClean显著提高了事实一致性，优于竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: HalluClean框架能够有效增强LLM输出的可信度，在现实应用中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散语言模型并行生成与自回归模型质量优势之间的矛盾，寻求在保持高质量的同时实现高吞吐量和高GPU利用率。

Method: 设计结构化注意力掩码，在单个前向传播中同时进行扩散草稿生成（Thinking）和自回归最终采样（Talking）。

Result: 在1.5B和8B规模上，TiDAR在吞吐量上超过推测解码，在效率和质量上超过Dream和Llada等扩散模型，首次在保持AR级别质量的同时实现4.71-5.91倍的每秒token生成量。

Conclusion: TiDAR成功实现了扩散模型并行生成优势与自回归模型质量优势的协同，是首个在保持AR级别质量的同时显著提升吞吐量的架构。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

Motivation: 在自然语言推理等任务中，人类标注变异使得难以区分标注错误与合理变异，传统两轮人工标注方法成本高且覆盖有限。

Method: 提出EVADE框架，使用大语言模型生成和验证解释来检测错误，并与人工标注进行对比分析。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展错误检测规模，在减少人工努力的同时提高标签变异下的数据集质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法缺乏确保潜在表示稳定演变的机制，也没有系统方法来交织隐式和显式推理。

Method: 引入SpiralThinker框架，对潜在表示进行迭代更新，实现扩展隐式推理；使用渐进对齐目标和结构化标注来维持潜在与文本推理之间的一致性。

Result: 在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中，SpiralThinker在所有基准测试中始终超越先前方法，达到潜在推理方法中的最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: SpiralThinker桥接了迭代计算和潜在推理，证明对齐的迭代更新可以在潜在空间中可靠地引导推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型情感支持评估主要依赖短对话和静态评估，无法捕捉情感支持的动态性和长期性特征。

Method: 构建大规模基准测试，采用用户中心视角，将用户情感轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，使用因果调整的情感估计方法，并引入三种轨迹级评估指标。

Result: 对不同LLMs的广泛评估揭示了情感支持能力的显著差异，为模型开发提供了可操作的见解。

Conclusion: 该框架能够更全面地评估LLMs的长期情感支持性能，有助于推动情感支持AI的发展。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Motivation: 解决LLM在金融、医疗等受监管行业中应用的限制，这些行业需要严格遵守政策但LLM具有固有的随机性。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用LLM和可选人工指导将自然语言政策形式化；2) 推理时自动形式化验证自然语言陈述的逻辑正确性，通过多重冗余形式化步骤交叉检查语义等价性。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Result: 广泛的实验验证了MM-CRITIC的有效性，并对领先LMMs的批判能力进行了全面评估。分析揭示了响应质量与批判能力之间的相关性，以及不同评估维度下批判难度的变化。

Conclusion: MM-CRITIC为评估多模态模型的批判能力提供了可靠的基准，揭示了当前模型在这一重要能力上的表现和局限性。

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: 提出的动态分块框架有效解决了流式识别中的上下文截断问题，在安多藏语识别中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在复杂多步推理场景中效果有限，大多数方法依赖结果监督，缺乏对中间步骤的明确指导，导致奖励攻击和响应质量下降。

Method: 提出Bi-RAR框架，基于Kolmogorov复杂度引入双向信息距离来评估每个中间步骤的信息完整性，采用多目标强化学习框架和级联奖励结构来优化推理过程。

Conclusion: Bi-RAR通过双向评估中间步骤和级联奖励结构，显著提升了检索增强生成在多步推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

*Ritsu Sakabe,Hwichan Kim,Tosho Hirasawa,Mamoru Komachi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过日本即兴喜剧游戏Oogiri系统评估大语言模型的幽默能力，发现LLMs在幽默生成方面达到中低水平人类表现，但在共情能力上明显不足，且与人类在幽默评估标准上存在根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常使用单一维度评估大语言模型的幽默能力，本文认为需要多维度理解幽默，因此通过Oogiri这种日本即兴喜剧游戏来系统评估LLMs的幽默能力。

Method: 扩展现有Oogiri数据集，使用LLMs生成Oogiri响应，然后人工标注六个维度的5分绝对评分：新颖性、清晰度、相关性、智能性、共情性和整体趣味性，评估LLMs在生成和评估两个核心任务上的表现。

Result: LLMs能够生成达到中低水平人类表现的响应，但共情能力明显不足；相关性分析显示LLMs优先考虑新颖性，而人类优先考虑共情性，这解释了LLMs无法复制人类幽默评估的原因。

Conclusion: LLMs在幽默生成方面有一定能力，但在共情方面存在显著缺陷，与人类幽默评估标准存在根本差异，释放标注语料库以促进开发更情感智能的对话系统。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

TL;DR: DoPE是一种无需训练的位置编码去噪方法，通过截断矩阵熵检测特征图中的异常频率带，并使用参数自由的高斯分布重新参数化，显著改善了Transformer模型在长上下文（达64K tokens）中的长度外推能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE位置编码在Transformer模型中存在固有局限，削弱了长度外推能力。研究发现注意力图中存在噪声特征，导致注意力下沉现象。

Method: 将带位置编码的注意力图重新解释为噪声特征图，提出基于截断矩阵熵的DoPE方法检测异常频率带，并利用特征图的噪声特性进行高斯分布重新参数化。

Result: 在needle-in-a-haystack和many-shot in-context learning任务中，DoPE显著提高了检索准确性和推理稳定性，在长达64K tokens的上下文中表现优异。

Conclusion: 位置编码的去噪策略有效缓解了注意力下沉现象，恢复了平衡的注意力模式，为改进长度泛化提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工具学习中的静态数据管道将数据生成和模型训练作为两个分离的非交互过程，无法自适应关注模型的具体弱点，且允许噪声标签持续存在，降低了训练效率。

Method: LoopTool通过三个模块实现闭环数据进化：贪婪能力探测诊断模型掌握和失败的能力；判断引导标签验证使用开源判断模型查找并纠正标注错误；错误驱动数据扩展基于识别出的失败生成新的挑战性样本。

Result: 使用LoopTool训练的8B模型显著超越了其32B数据生成器，在BFCL-v3和ACEBench基准测试中达到了其规模的最新最先进结果。

Conclusion: 闭环自精炼数据管道可以显著增强LLMs的工具使用能力，且能在成本效益高的开源生态系统中运行，消除了对昂贵闭源API的依赖。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在表格问答中直接输入整个表格作为长文本往往导致错误答案，因为大多数LLM无法固有地捕捉复杂的表格结构。

Method: 使用语言模型和TF-IDF的混合检索机制计算问题与单元格的相似度来估计表头，通过对比学习在小数据集上训练语言模型，在最相关行列的交集处选择答案单元格。

Result: 在NTCIR-18 U4共享任务的TQA数据集上评估，准确率达到74.6%，优于GPT-4o mini等现有LLM（63.9%）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了表格结构理解问题，未来计划集成更高效的文本搜索模型来进一步提高性能并缩小与人工评估结果的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

Conclusion: 支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为经过验证、可解释且具有补充价值的特征，用于自动作文评分及相关NLP任务

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

Motivation: 传统子词分割通常在预处理阶段固定，但本文探索在训练过程中动态学习子词分割的可能性，研究其学习动态如何影响语言模型的性能。

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型(SSLM)框架，支持预训练和微调，在三种类型学不同的语言(isi-Xhosa、Setswana、英语)上训练模型，从语言学角度分析子词动态变化。

Result: 识别出子词学习的四个阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性；微调过程中子词边界变得更细粒度；可学习子词能提升低资源复杂形态语言的文本生成和跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 可学习的子词分割为低资源、形态复杂语言提供了有前景的改进方法，子词边界在训练过程中会动态调整以适应具体任务需求。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要优化最终任务结果，但在诚实对齐任务中，模型不仅需要解决可回答的查询，还要识别无法从前提得出结论的情况。当早期训练中负奖励占主导时，模型容易崩溃。

Method: 从图结构中构建了两个多步演绎推理数据集（线性代数和逻辑推理），通过随机扰动边创建不可回答案例。提出了Anchor方法，在rollout中注入真实轨迹以防止早期训练崩溃。

Result: 实验表明GRPO方法（无论是否使用监督微调初始化）在这些任务上表现不佳。Anchor方法显著稳定了学习过程，并大幅提升了整体推理性能。

Conclusion: 训练动态对于实现对齐语言模型中可靠的演绎推理至关重要，Anchor方法通过注入真实轨迹有效解决了早期训练崩溃问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

Motivation: 现有语音大语言模型在多语言语音到文本翻译中忽视了源语言间的语义共性，导致翻译性能存在偏差，特别是在高低资源语言之间。

Method: 1) 偏置补偿模块粗对齐跨语言语音表示；2) 在Q-Former上施加token级最优传输约束建立细粒度表示一致性；3) 层调度策略将OT约束聚焦于最具语义价值的层。

Conclusion: POTSA框架通过最优传输有效提升了语音大语言模型的多语言翻译性能，特别是在低资源和零样本语言场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

Motivation: 现有方法难以精确控制多个文本属性，特别是在属性冲突时缺乏协调机制，且无法在生成过程中进行迭代优化

Method: 两阶段框架：生成阶段使用属性分类器和加权KL散度调整token概率；优化阶段通过能量函数结合分类器分数和惩罚项，通过迭代反馈解决属性冲突

Result: 在多个指标上显著优于基线方法，包括属性准确性、语言流畅性和输出多样性，同时降低毒性

Conclusion: C³TG是无需昂贵模型修改的有效灵活的多维文本属性控制解决方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

Method: 引入LiteraryTaste数据集，包含60人的阅读习惯和品味自述（自述偏好）以及对100对短创意写作文本的偏好标注（显示偏好），使用transformer编码器进行微调建模偏好。

Result: 1）人们在创意写作偏好上存在分歧；2）微调transformer编码器在建模个人和集体显示偏好时分别达到75.8%和67.7%的准确率；3）自述偏好在建模显示偏好方面效用有限。

Conclusion: 通过LLM驱动的可解释性管道分析了人们偏好的变化方式，希望该工作为个性化创意写作技术发展奠定基础。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

### [43] [Towards Explainable Khmer Polarity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09313)
*Marry Kong,Rina Buoy,Sovisal Chenda,Nguonly Taing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的高棉语极性分类器，通过微调基于指令的推理模型Qwen-3，不仅能准确预测极性标签，还能提供解释说明预测理由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高棉语模型通常只预测标签而不解释预测依据，缺乏可解释性。

Method: 通过微调基于指令的推理模型Qwen-3，构建了包含短到中等长度非正式、罗马化和混合代码高棉语表达的新数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示微调后的模型不仅能准确预测标签，还能通过识别极性相关关键词或短语来提供推理支持其预测。

Conclusion: 成功开发了可解释的高棉语极性分类器，并贡献了新的高棉语极性数据集和微调模型，均在Hugging Face上公开可用。

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

*Zhuoqun Huang,Neil G. Marchant,Olga Ohrimenko,Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AdaptDel方法，通过动态调整删除率来改进序列分类的认证鲁棒性，在编辑距离扰动下实现了比现有方法更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定删除率处理变长序列输入（如自然语言句子）导致性能不佳，需要适应不同输入特性的可变删除率方法。

Method: 引入AdaptDel方法，具有可适应删除率，根据输入特性动态调整；将随机平滑理论框架扩展到可变率删除，确保对编辑距离的可靠认证。

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得强实证结果，认证区域的中值基数比最先进认证方法提高了多达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态调整删除率显著提升了序列分类在编辑距离扰动下的认证鲁棒性性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了mmJEE-Eval多模态双语基准，基于印度JEE Advanced考试，评估视觉语言模型的科学推理能力，发现前沿模型与开源模型存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理基准无法区分真正的科学推理能力与模式匹配，需要更严格的评估标准。

Method: 构建包含1460道JEE Advanced考题的多模态双语基准，涵盖物理、化学、数学，评估17个最先进模型。

Result: 前沿VLMs在2025年考题上达到77-84%准确率，开源模型仅37-45%，当增加推理负荷时GPT-5仅修复5.2%错误。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval能有效区分训练和推理方法的优劣，其难度源于复杂性和推理深度而非记忆。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

TL;DR: SeerSC是一个动态自一致性框架，通过整合系统1和系统2推理，同时提高令牌效率和降低延迟。它使用快速的系统1计算答案熵来评估样本的扩展潜力，在系统2下实现动态自一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展能提高大语言模型的推理性能，但计算成本高昂。现有动态自一致性方法虽然减少了令牌消耗，但仍受限于串行请求的高延迟。

Method: 利用快速的系统1计算查询的答案熵，该分数用于评估样本的扩展潜力，在系统2下实现动态自一致性。通过并行生成显著降低延迟。

Result: 该方法在无明显性能损失的情况下，实现了高达47%的令牌消耗减少和43%的推理延迟降低，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SeerSC通过整合系统1和系统2推理，有效解决了测试时扩展中的令牌效率和延迟问题，为LLM推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Spider4SSC数据集和S2CLite解析工具，S2CLite是一个轻量级、本体无关的解析器，可将SPARQL查询转换为Cypher查询，在BSBM42和Spider4SPARQL数据集上的实验显示其解析准确率显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SPARQL到Cypher的转换工具存在解析错误率高的问题，需要开发更准确、轻量级的解析器来支持大规模查询转换。

Method: S2CLite采用纯基于规则的方法（受传统编程语言编译器启发），无需RDF图或外部工具，实现SPARQL到Cypher的转换。

Result: 在Spider4SPARQL数据集上，S2CLite解析准确率达到77.8%，显著优于S2CTrans的44.2%；在共同解析的查询子集上执行准确率达到96.6%，优于S2CTrans 7.3%。

Conclusion: S2CLite在SPARQL到Cypher转换方面表现出色，生成的Spider4SSC数据集为文本到查询语言研究提供了统一基准，工具和数据集均已开源。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTQ-Eval是一个用于多语言文本质量评估的新框架，通过从高质量和低质量文本示例中学习来调整内部表示，在115种语言上展现出改进的性能，并能提升下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在任务特定评估中表现有效且可扩展，但尚不确定这种能力是否能扩展到更一般的文本质量评估，特别是在多语言环境中。

Method: 首先自动生成文本质量偏好数据，然后使用这些数据训练开源基础大语言模型，使其与高质量和低质量文本的评分保持一致。

Result: 在115种语言上的综合评估表明，所提出模型的性能得到了改善。进一步分析发现，这种增强的评估能力还能显著改善下游任务。

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval框架成功地将大语言模型的评估能力扩展到多语言文本质量评估领域，并证明这种能力可以提升下游任务表现。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Motivation: 研究LLM自我修正机制在不同任务范式（开放式生成vs多项选择）中的动态差异，为智能体应用设计提供指导。

Method: 通过系统实验比较不同规模LLM在多种自然语言理解和推理任务中的表现，分析两种范式下的性能趋势和错误修正行为。

Conclusion: 自我修正机制设计应考虑任务结构与输出空间的交互作用，这对知识密集型推理和决策导向应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了AMaPO方法解决离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，通过自适应边距动态调整学习梯度，提升排序准确性和下游对齐性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线偏好优化方法在排序准确性上存在局限性，主要问题是过拟合-欠拟合困境：对正确排序样本施加过多梯度（过拟合），对错误排序样本提供不足修正信号（欠拟合）

Method: 提出AMaPO算法，采用实例级自适应边距，通过Z归一化和指数缩放进行优化，动态重新分配学习努力，放大错误排序样本的梯度，抑制正确样本的梯度

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，AMaPO不仅实现了更好的排序准确性和优越的下游对齐性能，还成功缓解了核心的过拟合和欠拟合问题

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边距设计有效解决了离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，为语言模型对齐提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

Motivation: 商业MLLM在低资源语言上表现尚可，但开源社区尚未实现可比结果，旨在为巴斯克语开发强大的MLLM。

Method: 构建训练和评估图像-文本数据集，使用Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克适配的Latxa作为骨干模型，探索不同数据混合比例进行训练。

Result: 仅需约20%的巴斯克多模态数据即可在巴斯克基准测试中获得稳定结果，且无需巴斯克指令调优的骨干LLM。

Conclusion: 为其他低资源语言开发MLLM提供了可行路径，并开源发布相关资源。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Conclusion: 为开发更全面、通用和有效的心理咨询模型提供了方向，CARE-Bench能够更好地评估模型在心理咨询领域的综合能力。

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Motivation: 机器学习研究发展迅速，从科学出版物中提取信息有助于大规模识别研究概念和资源，从而提升对ML研究的理解和可复现性。需要细粒度数据集来支持方法训练和数据使用等信息的提取与关联。

Method: 构建了GSAP-ERE数据集，包含从100篇机器学习出版物全文手动标注的63K实体和35K关系，涵盖10种实体类型和18种语义分类的关系类型。使用该数据集微调模型进行信息抽取，并与LLM提示方法进行对比。

Result: 微调模型在命名实体识别（NER）和关系抽取（RE）任务上表现优异（NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0%），显著优于最先进的LLM提示方法（NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1%）。该数据集支持知识图谱构建和大规模AI研究可复现性监控。

Conclusion: 监督学习模型在信息抽取任务上明显优于无监督的LLM方法，表明需要像GSAP-ERE这样的数据集来推进学术信息抽取领域的研究。

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

Motivation: 从大量生成文本中预测个体人格特质具有挑战性，特别是当文本量很大时，需要解决输入文本限制问题。

Method: 使用TPoT策略语义过滤文本，构建BIG5-TPoT深度学习模型，选择与特定人格特质、方面或项目语义相关的文本作为输入。

Result: 该方法在Stream of Consciousness Essays数据集上改善了平均绝对误差和准确率指标。

Conclusion: TPoT是一种简单有效的策略，通过语义相关文本选择来提升人格特质预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自动文本简化(ATS)中可读性度量与自动评估指标和人工判断之间的相关性，发现在英语ATS中，可读性度量与自动指标和人工判断的相关性普遍较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动文本简化研究中，虽然已有关于自动评估指标与人工判断相关性的研究，但可读性度量（如可读性公式或语言特征）与这两者之间的关系尚未得到足够关注。

Method: 首先讨论了ATS与可读性研究的关系，然后报告了一项关于可读性度量与人工判断之间、以及可读性度量与ATS评估指标之间相关性的研究。

Result: 研究发现，可读性度量通常与自动指标和人工判断的相关性较差。

Conclusion: 由于评估简化的三个不同角度（可读性度量、自动指标、人工判断）之间相关性较低，ATS领域需要明确定义其构造概念。

Abstract: Readability is a key concept in the current era of abundant written information. To help making texts more readable and make information more accessible to everyone, a line of researched aims at making texts accessible for their target audience: automatic text simplification (ATS). Lately, there have been studies on the correlations between automatic evaluation metrics in ATS and human judgment. However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment. We argue that as the three different angles from which simplification can be assessed tend to exhibit rather low correlations with one another, there is a need for a clear definition of the construct in ATS.

TL;DR: SynClaimEval框架用于评估合成数据在长文本声明验证任务中的效用，该框架从输入特征、合成逻辑和解释质量三个维度进行分析，实验表明长文本合成可以提升基础指令调优模型的验证性能，特别是增强解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建用于训练和评估的长文本标注资源成本高昂，合成数据提供了可扩展的替代方案，需要评估其在长文本声明验证任务中的实用性。

Method: 引入SynClaimEval框架，从三个维度评估合成数据：输入特征（上下文长度变化和跨领域泛化）、合成逻辑（声明复杂度和错误类型变化）、解释质量（模型解释与预测的一致性）。

Result: 实验表明长文本合成可以改进基础指令调优模型的声明验证性能，特别是在增强现有人工编写数据集时效果更佳；合成还能提升解释质量，即使验证分数没有改善。

Conclusion: 合成数据有潜力同时增强模型性能和可解释性，特别是在长文本声明验证任务中，即使验证性能没有提升，解释质量也能得到改善。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context windows promise direct reasoning over long documents, reducing the need for chunking or retrieval. Constructing annotated resources for training and evaluation, however, remains costly. Synthetic data offers a scalable alternative, and we introduce SynClaimEval, a framework for evaluating synthetic data utility in long-context claim verification -- a task central to hallucination detection and fact-checking. Our framework examines three dimensions: (i) input characteristics, by varying context length and testing generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks; (ii) synthesis logic, by controlling claim complexity and error type variation; and (iii) explanation quality, measuring the degree to which model explanations provide evidence consistent with predictions. Experiments across benchmarks show that long-context synthesis can improve verification in base instruction-tuned models, particularly when augmenting existing human-written datasets. Moreover, synthesis enhances explanation quality, even when verification scores do not improve, underscoring its potential to strengthen both performance and explainability.

Main category: q-fin.MF

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于风险中性概率测度的随机SINDy方法，从单对股票和期权轨迹中恢复后向随机微分方程(BSDE)，无需遍历性假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有识别随机微分方程的方法通常需要遍历性假设，这限制了在有限金融时间序列数据中的应用。本文旨在消除这一假设，利用风险中性测度从有限数据中恢复BSDE。

Method: 引入风险中性概率测度下的随机SINDy框架，从单对股票和期权轨迹中恢复BSDE，无需遍历性假设。

Result: 能够进行前瞻性预测，并生成与基础概率定律一致的新合成数据路径。

Conclusion: 该框架成功消除了遍历性假设，使BSDE恢复能够在有限金融时间序列数据中实现，并具备预测和合成数据生成能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven framework for discovering probabilistic laws underlying the Feynman-Kac formula. Specifically, we introduce the first stochastic SINDy method formulated under the risk-neutral probability measure to recover the backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) from a single pair of stock and option trajectories. Unlike existing approaches to identifying stochastic differential equations-which typically require ergodicity-our framework leverages the risk-neutral measure, thereby eliminating the ergodicity assumption and enabling BSDE recovery from limited financial time series data. Using this algorithm, we are able not only to make forward-looking predictions but also to generate new synthetic data paths consistent with the underlying probabilistic law.

Main category: q-fin.MF

TL;DR: 将深度学习数值方法扩展到非马尔可夫框架下的完全耦合前向-后向随机微分方程，提供误差估计和收敛性分析，并应用于粗糙波动率下的效用最大化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献主要分析马尔可夫框架或部分耦合的FBSDEs，缺乏对非马尔可夫框架下完全耦合FBSDEs的深度学习数值方法研究。

Method: 提出深度学习数值方法处理非马尔可夫框架下的完全耦合FBSDEs，其中前向过程的漂移和扩散系数可以是随机的且依赖于后向分量Y和Z。

Result: 提供了误差估计和收敛性分析，证明了方法的理论保证。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅理论上有保障，而且在实际应用中有效，特别是在粗糙波动率下的效用最大化问题中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: In this work, we extend deep learning-based numerical methods to fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) within a non-Markovian framework. Error estimates and convergence are provided. In contrast to the existing literature, our approach not only analyzes the non-Markovian framework but also addresses fully coupled settings, in which both the drift and diffusion coefficients of the forward process may be random and depend on the backward components $Y$ and $Z$. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical applicability of our framework by addressing utility maximization problems under rough volatility, which are solved numerically with the proposed deep learning-based methods.

### [59] [Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effects and Network Fragility: Theory and Evidence from the 2008 Financial Crisis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08602)
*Tatsuru Kikuchi*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个统一的空间-网络框架来分析系统性风险动态，揭示了三个挑战传统观念的关键发现：银行整合反而增加了系统性脆弱性；金融传染具有全球传播特性而无明显空间衰减；传统方法在忽略网络结构时会严重高估危机影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2008年金融危机暴露了互联银行系统的根本脆弱性，但现有框架未能整合空间传播与网络传染机制，需要开发统一的分析框架来准确评估系统性风险。

Method: 使用来自28个国家156家机构的双边敞口数据（2007-2023年），结合网络拉普拉斯算子的谱分析和空间双重差分识别方法，分析系统性风险动态。

Result: 发现银行数量下降47.3%的同时网络脆弱性上升315.8%；金融传染边界距离达47,474公里而无明显空间衰减；传统方法高估危机影响73.2%；危机效应随时间放大而非消散，脆弱性比危机前水平高出68.4%。

Conclusion: 准确的系统性风险评估和宏观审慎政策设计需要明确纳入空间传播和网络拓扑结构，网络目标资本要求比统一监管实现11.3倍的放大效应。

Abstract: The 2008 financial crisis exposed fundamental vulnerabilities in interconnected banking systems, yet existing frameworks fail to integrate spatial propagation with network contagion mechanisms. This paper develops a unified spatial-network framework to analyze systemic risk dynamics, revealing three critical findings that challenge conventional wisdom. First, banking consolidation paradoxically increased systemic fragility: while bank numbers declined 47.3% from 2007 to 2023, network fragility measured by algebraic connectivity rose 315.8%, demonstrating that interconnectedness intensity dominates institutional count. Second, financial contagion propagates globally with negligible spatial decay (boundary d* = 47,474 km), contrasting sharply with localized technology diffusion (d* = 69 km)--a scale difference of 688 times. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods overestimate crisis impacts by 73.2% when ignoring network structure, producing severely biased policy assessments. Using bilateral exposure data from 156 institutions across 28 countries (2007-2023) and employing spectral analysis of network Laplacian operators combined with spatial difference-in-differences identification, we document that crisis effects amplified over time rather than dissipating, increasing fragility 68.4% above pre-crisis levels with persistent effects through 2023. The consolidation paradox exhibits near-perfect correlation (R = 0.97) between coupling strength and systemic vulnerability, validating theoretical predictions from continuous spatial dynamics. Policy simulations demonstrate network-targeted capital requirements achieve 11.3x amplification effects versus uniform regulations. These findings establish that accurate systemic risk assessment and macroprudential policy design require explicit incorporation of both spatial propagation and network topology.

*Peng Liu,Steven Vanduffel,Yi Xia*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: 本文建立了在分布不确定性下失真风险度量的尖锐上下界，不确定性集由均值、方差、单峰性和与参考分布的Wasserstein距离四个关键特征定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究失真风险度量在分布不确定性下的稳健边界，为投资组合优化和模型风险评估提供改进的决策支持。

Method: 首先研究一般失真风险度量，仅假设失真函数具有有限变差；然后考虑不确定性集由固定均值、方差和Wasserstein距离定义的情况；最后进一步约束单峰性假设。

Result: 确定了失真风险度量的最坏和最佳情况值及其对应的极值分布，包括绝对连续失真函数的情况。

Conclusion: 研究结果为模型不确定性下的决策提供了理论支持，可应用于稳健投资组合优化和模型风险评估。

Abstract: We establish sharp upper and lower bounds for distortion risk metrics under distributional uncertainty. The uncertainty sets are characterized by four key features of the underlying distribution: mean, variance, unimodality, and Wasserstein distance to a reference distribution.
  We first examine very general distortion risk metrics, assuming only finite variation for the underlying distortion function and without requiring continuity or monotonicity. This broad framework includes notable distortion risk metrics such as range value-at-risk, glue value-at-risk, Gini deviation, mean-median deviation and inter-quantile difference. In this setting, when the uncertainty set is characterized by a fixed mean, variance and a Wasserstein distance, we determine both the worst- and best-case values of a given distortion risk metric and identify the corresponding extremal distribution. When the uncertainty set is further constrained by unimodality with a fixed inflection point, we establish for the case of absolutely continuous distortion functions the extremal values along with their respective extremal distributions. We apply our results to robust portfolio optimization and model risk assessment offering improved decision-making under model uncertainty.

*Lorenzo Carta,Fernando Spadea,Oshani Seneviratne*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: 首次将联邦学习应用于美国国家金融能力研究，开发了一个可解释的框架来预测消费者财务困境，无需集中敏感数据，为金融预警系统提供了可扩展、合规的蓝图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在保护敏感数据隐私的同时，进行全国范围消费者财务困境预测的需求，模拟真实世界金融系统的治理结构。

Method: 采用跨孤岛联邦学习设置，将每个州视为独立数据孤岛；整合两种互补的可解释AI技术来识别全局和局部预测因子；开发专门针对高度分类、不平衡调查数据的机器学习模型。

Result: 成功识别了全国性和州特定的财务困境预测因子（如债务催收机构的联系），证明了联邦学习在金融应用中的可行性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了联邦学习如何推动社会责任AI在消费者信用风险和金融包容性领域的应用，为金融预警系统提供了可扩展且合规的技术方案。

Abstract: We present the first application of federated learning (FL) to the U.S. National Financial Capability Study, introducing an interpretable framework for predicting consumer financial distress across all 50 states and the District of Columbia without centralizing sensitive data. Our cross-silo FL setup treats each state as a distinct data silo, simulating real-world governance in nationwide financial systems. Unlike prior work, our approach integrates two complementary explainable AI techniques to identify both global (nationwide) and local (state-specific) predictors of financial hardship, such as contact from debt collection agencies. We develop a machine learning model specifically suited for highly categorical, imbalanced survey data. This work delivers a scalable, regulation-compliant blueprint for early warning systems in finance, demonstrating how FL can power socially responsible AI applications in consumer credit risk and financial inclusion.

### [62] [When Reasoning Fails: Evaluating 'Thinking' LLMs for Stock Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08608)
*Rakeshkumar H Sodha*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: 在固定推理预算下，随着股票数量增加，思考型LLM的排名质量下降，而直接型LLM保持稳定。思考型LLM方差更高，需要后校准，且在实际交易成本下没有净优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证思考型LLM在噪声大、厚尾和制度转换的金融数据上是否比直接型LLM和传统方法表现更好。

Method: 使用印度股票数据，进行滚动48个月/1个月的向前评估，比较直接LLM、思考型LLM和传统学习方法在交叉排名损失、MSE和回测上的表现。

Result: 思考型LLM在固定预算下随复杂度增加表现恶化，方差更高，需要校准，且在实际交易成本下无优势。

Conclusion: 在短期股票排名任务中，思考型LLM尚未准备好替代传统或直接方法，需要扩展推理预算和/或重新调整目标。

Abstract: Problem. "Thinking" LLMs (TLLMs) expose explicit or hidden reasoning traces and are widely believed to generalize better on complex tasks than direct LLMs. Whether this promise carries to noisy, heavy-tailed and regime-switching financial data remains unclear.
  Approach. Using Indian equities (NIFTY constituents), we run a rolling 48m/1m walk-forward evaluation at horizon k = 1 day and dial cross-sectional complexity via the universe size U in {5, 11, 21, 36} while keeping the reasoning budget fixed (B = 512 tokens) for the TLLM. We compare a direct LLM (gpt-4o-mini), a TLLM (gpt-5), and classical learners (ridge, random forest) on cross-sectional ranking loss 1 - IC, MSE, and long/short backtests with realistic costs. Statistical confidence is measured with Diebold-Mariano, Pesaran-Timmermann, and SPA tests.
  Main findings.
  (i) As U grows under a fixed budget B, the TLLM's ranking quality deteriorates, whereas the direct LLM remains flat and classical baselines are stable.
  (ii) TLLM variance is higher, requiring ex-post calibration (winsorization and blending) for stability.
  (iii) Portfolio results under transaction costs do not support a net advantage for the TLLM.
  Hypotheses. Our results are consistent with the following testable hypotheses:
  H1 (Capacity-Complexity Mismatch): for fixed B, TLLM accuracy degrades superlinearly in cross-sectional complexity.
  H2 (Reasoning Variance): TLLM outputs exhibit higher dispersion date-by-date than direct LLMs, increasing error bars and turnover.
  H3 (Domain Misfit): next-token prediction objectives and token-budgeted inference are poorly aligned with heavy-tailed, weakly predictable stock returns.
  Implication. In our setting, "thinking" LLMs are not yet ready to replace classical or direct methods for short-horizon stock ranking; scaling the reasoning budget and/or re-aligning objectives appears necessary.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: 提出了Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA)框架，结合语言推理和潜在推理来生成准确且可解释的股票时间序列预测，在多个市场数据集上达到最先进的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要分析文本报告而非历史价格数据（技术分析），而技术分析需要在时间序列域和自然语言域之间切换，这是一个挑战。

Method: 将股票价格数据转换为文本注释，使用逆均方误差奖励目标优化推理轨迹，并将时间序列骨干模型的输出基于推理属性进行条件化。

Result: 在美国、中国和欧洲市场股票数据集上的实验表明，VTA实现了最先进的预测精度，且推理轨迹在行业专家评估中表现良好。

Conclusion: VTA框架成功地将语言推理与时间序列预测相结合，既提高了预测准确性，又提供了可解释的推理过程。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have been used to produce interpretable stock forecasts, they mainly focus on analyzing textual reports but not historical price data, also known as Technical Analysis. This task is challenging as it switches between domains: the stock price inputs and outputs lie in the time-series domain, while the reasoning step should be in natural language. In this work, we introduce Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA), a novel framework that combine verbal and latent reasoning to produce stock time-series forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable. To reason over time-series, we convert stock price data into textual annotations and optimize the reasoning trace using an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward objective. To produce time-series outputs from textual reasoning, we condition the outputs of a time-series backbone model on the reasoning-based attributes. Experiments on stock datasets across U.S., Chinese, and European markets show that VTA achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, while the reasoning traces also perform well on evaluation by industry experts.

Conclusion: LLM Pro Finance Suite在提升金融专业知识的同时不损害通用能力，是金融工作流程中现有LLM的理想替代品，公开发布了两个8B参数模型以促进金融NLP应用的研究和发展。

Abstract: The financial industry's growing demand for advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities has highlighted the limitations of generalist large language models (LLMs) in handling domain-specific financial tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the LLM Pro Finance Suite, a collection of five instruction-tuned LLMs (ranging from 8B to 70B parameters) specifically designed for financial applications. Our approach focuses on enhancing generalist instruction-tuned models, leveraging their existing strengths in instruction following, reasoning, and toxicity control, while fine-tuning them on a curated, high-quality financial corpus comprising over 50% finance-related data in English, French, and German.
  We evaluate the LLM Pro Finance Suite on a comprehensive financial benchmark suite, demonstrating consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in finance-oriented tasks and financial translation. Notably, our models maintain the strong general-domain capabilities of their base models, ensuring reliable performance across non-specialized tasks. This dual proficiency, enhanced financial expertise without compromise on general abilities, makes the LLM Pro Finance Suite an ideal drop-in replacement for existing LLMs in financial workflows, offering improved domain-specific performance while preserving overall versatility. We publicly release two 8B-parameters models to foster future research and development in financial NLP applications: https://huggingface.co/collections/DragonLLM/llm-open-finance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多周期学习框架(MLF)用于金融时间序列预测，通过三个新模块(IRF、LWI、MAP)整合多周期输入提高准确性，并使用Patch Squeeze模块提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融时间序列模式受短期公众意见和中长期政策市场趋势影响，需要处理多周期输入以获得准确预测，但现有模型要么只使用单周期输入，要么缺乏针对多周期特性的定制设计。

Method: 设计了三个新模块：IRF去除周期间信息冗余，LWI有效整合多周期预测，MAP通过设置相同补丁数减轻对特定周期的偏置；还提出Patch Squeeze模块减少自注意力建模中的补丁数以提高效率。

Result: MLF能够整合不同长度的多周期输入，实现更好的准确性，同时减少训练中选择输入长度的成本。

Conclusion: MLF框架通过多周期学习有效提升了金融时间序列预测的性能，在准确性和效率方面都有显著改进。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is important in finance domain. Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF). However, current TSF models either use only single-period input, or lack customized designs for addressing multi-period characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/MLF.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate a number of Artificial Neural Network architectures (well-known and more ``exotic'') in application to the long-term financial time-series forecasts of indexes on different global markets. The particular area of interest of this research is to examine the correlation of these indexes' behaviour in terms of Machine Learning algorithms cross-training. Would training an algorithm on an index from one global market produce similar or even better accuracy when such a model is applied for predicting another index from a different market? The demonstrated predominately positive answer to this question is another argument in favour of the long-debated Efficient Market Hypothesis of Eugene Fama.

Motivation: 研究DAOs作为新型组织形式如何重新分配决策权，以及它们能否实现民主承诺还是可能复制现有的权力不对称。

Method: 通过分析DAOs在金融、科学和数字社区等领域的治理实践，探讨其程序化、透明和参与式机制。

Result: 识别了DAOs带来的激励协调、快速协调和抗审查等机会，但也面临代币集中、参与度低和事实上的中心化等挑战。

Conclusion: DAOs在特定条件下可能实现民主承诺，但也存在复制现有权力不对称的风险，特别是在与AI结合时需警惕人类监督减少和算法不透明性的危险。

Abstract: This chapter explores how Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), a novel institutional form based on blockchain technology, challenge traditional centralized governance structures. DAOs govern projects ranging from finance to science and digital communities. They aim to redistribute decision-making power through programmable, transparent, and participatory mechanisms. This chapter outlines both the opportunities DAOs present, such as incentive alignment, rapid coordination, and censorship resistance, and the challenges they face, including token concentration, low participation, and the risk of de facto centralization. It further discusses the emerging intersection of DAOs and artificial intelligence, highlighting the potential for increased automation alongside the dangers of diminished human oversight and algorithmic opacity. Ultimately, we discuss under what circumstances DAOs can fulfill their democratic promise or risk replicating the very power asymmetries they seek to overcome.

Abstract: Housing cooperative is a common type of multifamily building ownership in Sweden. Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice.

Motivation: 在社会政治不稳定背景下设计有影响力的教育技术需要理解教育愿望，但目前缺乏可扩展的愿望测量指标。

Method: 研究改编、翻译并评估Snyder希望量表，用于测量136名在阿富汗教育限制期间在线学习编程女性的愿望，检验量表的可靠性和相关性。

Result: 改编量表显示出良好信度（Cronbach's α = 0.78），参与者认为其易于理解和相关。虽然总体愿望得分在有无LLM访问权限的群体间无显著差异，但使用LLM的参与者在途径子量表上得分略高（p = .056）。

Conclusion: 改编量表可作为社会政治不稳定背景下愿望测量的有效工具，并可用于评估愿望驱动教育技术设计的影响。

Abstract: Designing impactful educational technologies in contexts of socio-political instability requires a nuanced understanding of educational aspirations. Currently, scalable metrics for measuring aspirations are limited. This study adapts, translates, and evaluates Snyder's Hope Scale as a metric for measuring aspirations among 136 women learning programming online during a period of systemic educational restrictions in Afghanistan. The adapted scale demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.78) and participants rated it as understandable and relevant. While overall aspiration-related scores did not differ significantly by access to Large Language Models (LLMs), those with access reported marginally higher scores on the Avenues subscale (p = .056), suggesting broader perceived pathways to achieving educational aspirations. These findings support the use of the adapted scale as a metric for aspirations in contexts of socio-political instability. More broadly, the adapted scale can be used to evaluate the impact of aspiration-driven design of educational technologies.

Motivation: 前沿AI实验室面临激烈商业竞争压力，可能导致安全标准下降的风险。实验室间的自愿协调（如联合安全测试、信息共享和资源整合）可以降低灾难性和存在性风险，但反垄断审查风险可能阻碍这种有益合作。

Method: 分析无约束AI开发的风险和实验室间协调的益处，评估潜在的反垄断问题（包括产出限制、市场分配和信息共享），并调查可能的立法和监管改革方案。

Result: 识别了AI安全合作面临的反垄断障碍，提出了提供法律明确性和安全港的改革建议，以鼓励负责任的协作。

Conclusion: 美国反垄断政策需要演进，在鼓励AI安全合作与维护竞争原则之间取得平衡，通过适当的改革可以促进负责任的AI发展而不损害市场竞争。

Abstract: Frontier AI labs face intense commercial competitive pressure to develop increasingly powerful systems, raising the risk of a race to the bottom on safety. Voluntary coordination among labs - including by way of joint safety testing, information sharing, and resource pooling - could reduce catastrophic and existential risks. But the risk of antitrust scrutiny may deter such collaboration, even when it is demonstrably beneficial. This paper explores how U.S. antitrust policy can evolve to accommodate AI safety cooperation without abandoning core competition principles. After outlining the risks of unconstrained AI development and the benefits of lab-lab coordination, the paper analyses potential antitrust concerns, including output restrictions, market allocation, and information sharing. It then surveys a range of legislative and regulatory reforms that could provide legal clarity and safe harbours that will encourage responsible collaboration.

*Chung Peng Lee,Rachel Hong,Harry Jiang,Aster Plotnik,William Agnew,Jamie Morgenstern*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究分析了DataComp数据集中数据所有者对AI数据抓取和训练的同意表达方式，发现当前AI数据收集流程未能充分尊重数据所有者的意愿，存在大量版权声明、服务条款禁止抓取和水印等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网已成为训练现代文本到图像或视觉语言模型的主要数据来源，但网络规模的数据收集实践是否充分尊重数据所有者的意愿日益受到质疑。忽视数据所有者的同意表示不仅引发伦理问题，还导致版权侵权诉讼。

Method: 研究分析了DataComp数据集中的12.8亿个文本-图像对，从样本级别（版权声明、水印、元数据）和网站级别（服务条款、机器人排除协议）两个维度考察数据同意表达。

Result: 发现CommonPool中至少有1.22亿样本显示版权声明，前50个域名的样本中有60%来自禁止抓取的网站，9-13%的样本包含水印但现有检测方法无法有效识别。

Conclusion: 数据所有者通过多种渠道传达数据同意，但当前AI数据收集流程未能完全尊重这些表达。这凸显了当前数据集策展/发布实践的局限性，需要建立考虑AI用途的统一数据同意框架。

Abstract: The internet has become the main source of data to train modern text-to-image or vision-language models, yet it is increasingly unclear whether web-scale data collection practices for training AI systems adequately respect data owners' wishes. Ignoring the owner's indication of consent around data usage not only raises ethical concerns but also has recently been elevated into lawsuits around copyright infringement cases. In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping. Furthermore, we estimate 9-13\% with 95\% confidence interval of samples from CommonPool to contain watermarks, where existing watermark detection methods fail to capture them in high fidelity. Our holistic methods and findings show that data owners rely on various channels to convey data consent, of which current AI data collection pipelines do not entirely respect. These findings highlight the limitations of the current dataset curation/release practice and the need for a unified data consent framework taking AI purposes into consideration.

*Michele Loi*

TL;DR: 本文分析了学术出版中AI协助披露的结构性矛盾，指出传统出版体系无法通过政策调整解决这一问题，提出了一个替代性出版基础设施方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版要求作者披露AI协助，但实质性AI协助会带来声誉成本，这种结构性矛盾阻碍了透明度，特别是在AI协助程度较高的工作中。

Method: 提出一个位于声望体系之外的替代出版基础设施，强制要求披露、支持基于复现的评审，并通过详细文档确保生态效度。文章本身作为示范，提供了详细的AI协助披露记录。

Result: 文章展示了在透明文档、验证导向评审和方法论承诺学者参与的条件下，AI协助学术工作可以按其自身条件进行评估。

Conclusion: 虽然聚焦于AI，但该框架适用于更广泛的学术系统如何处理方法论创新的问题，为AI协助学术工作的评估提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Academic publishing increasingly requires authors to disclose AI assistance, yet imposes reputational costs for doing so--especially when such assistance is substantial. This article analyzes that structural contradiction, showing how incentives discourage transparency in precisely the work where it matters most. Traditional venues cannot resolve this tension through policy tweaks alone, as the underlying prestige economy rewards opacity. To address this, the article proposes an alternative publishing infrastructure: a venue outside prestige systems that enforces mandatory disclosure, enables reproduction-based review, and supports ecological validity through detailed documentation. As a demonstration of this approach, the article itself is presented as an example of AI-assisted scholarship under reasonably detailed disclosure, with representative prompt logs and modification records included. Rather than taking a position for or against AI-assisted scholarship, the article outlines conditions under which such work can be evaluated on its own terms: through transparent documentation, verification-oriented review, and participation by methodologically committed scholars. While focused on AI, the framework speaks to broader questions about how academic systems handle methodological innovation.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 分析Google NotebookLM生成的AI播客，发现其使用固定模板结构，并将不同语言和文化的文本统一转化为标准化的美国中西部口音和白人中产阶级文化背景，这改变了传统播客塑造公众的方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成播客虽在医学教育等工具性应用中被讨论，但尚未作为媒体形式被分析。本研究旨在探讨AI播客如何通过标准化模板和文化翻译影响公众形成。

Method: 通过上传不同类型文本到NotebookLM，分析生成的播客输出，研究其结构模板和文化翻译机制。

Result: 发现播客采用固定模板结构，将所有文本翻译为标准美国中西部口音，并将文化背景统一转化为白人中产阶级美国默认值，这标志着播客类型的一种抽象化。

Conclusion: AI播客代表了媒体塑造公众方式的新发展，背离了传统播客中针对特定社区和回应听众评论的多重公共领域模式，转向了播客类型的抽象化。

Abstract: This paper analyses AI-generated podcasts produced by Google's NotebookLM, which generates audio podcasts with two chatty AI hosts discussing whichever documents a user uploads. While AI-generated podcasts have been discussed as tools, for instance in medical education, they have not yet been analysed as media. By uploading different types of text and analysing the generated outputs I show how the podcasts' structure is built around a fixed template. I also find that NotebookLM not only translates texts from other languages into a perky standardised Mid-Western American accent, it also translates cultural contexts to a white, educated, middle-class American default. This is a distinct development in how publics are shaped by media, marking a departure from the multiple public spheres that scholars have described in human podcasting from the early 2000s until today, where hosts spoke to specific communities and responded to listener comments, to an abstraction of the podcast genre.

Conclusion: 研究强调了操作化价值在制定AI伦理设计要求中的重要性，有助于更深入理解AI与政策之间的相互作用。

Abstract: Scholars investigating ethical AI, especially in high stakes settings like child welfare, have arguably been seeking ways to embed notions of justice into the design of these critical technologies. These efforts often operationalize justice at the upper and lower bounds of its continuum, defining it in terms of progressiveness or reform. Before characterizing the type of justice an AI tool should have baked in, we argue for a systematic discovery of how justice is executed by the recipient system: a method the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) framework terms Value Source analysis. The present work asks: how is justice operationalized within current child welfare administrative policy and what does it teach us about how to develop AI? We conduct a mixed-methods analysis of child welfare policy in the state of New York and find a range of functional definitions of justice (which we term principles). These principles reflect more nuanced understandings of justice across a spectrum of contexts: from established concepts like fairness and equity to less common foci like the proprietary rights of parents and children. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between AI and policy, highlighting the importance of operationalized values in adjudicating our development of ethical design requirements for high stakes decision settings.

Abstract: Multimodal digital biomarkers (MDBs) integrate diverse physiological, behavioral, and contextual data to provide continuous representations of health. This paper argues that MDBs expand the concept of digital biomarkers along the dimensions of variability, complexity and abstraction, producing an ontological shift that datafies health and an epistemic shift that redefines health relevance. These transformations entail ethical implications for knowledge, responsibility, and governance in data-driven, preventive medicine.

Abstract: The large-scale integration of renewable energy and power electronic devices has increased the complexity of power system stability, making transient stability assessment more challenging. Conventional methods are limited in both accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes MoE-GraphSAGE, a graph neural network framework based on the MoE for unified TAS and TVS assessment. The framework leverages GraphSAGE to capture the power grid's spatiotemporal topological features and employs multi-expert networks with a gating mechanism to model distinct instability modes jointly. Experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that MoE-GraphSAGE achieves superior accuracy and efficiency, offering an effective solution for online multi-task transient stability assessment in complex power systems.

This paper presents a learning-based system identification approach for modelling of throttleable engine dynamics using data obtained from high-fidelity propulsion model. The developed model is validated with experimental results and used for closed-loop guidance and control simulations.

Abstract: This paper proposes an energy-workload coupled migration optimization strategy for virtual power plants (VPPs) with data centers (DCs) to enhance resource scheduling flexibility and achieve precise demand response (DR) curve tracking. A game-based coupled migration framework characterized by antisymmetric matrices is first established to facilitate the coordination of cross-regional resource allocation between VPPs. To address the challenge posed to conventional probabilistic modeling by the inherent data sparsity of DC workloads, deterministic equivalent transformations of fuzzy chance constraints are derived based on fuzzy set theory, and non-convex stochastic problems are transformed into a solvable second-order cone program. To address the multi-player interest coordination problem in cooperative games, an improved Shapley value profit allocation method with the VPP operator as intermediary is proposed to achieve a balance between theoretical fairness and computational feasibility. In addition, the alternating direction method of multipliers with consensus-based variable splitting is introduced to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem, transforming coupled antisymmetric constraints into separable subproblems with analytical solutions. Simulations based on real data from Google's multiple DCs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving DR curve tracking precision and reducing operational costs.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of online parameter estimation for cyber-physical systems with binary outputs that may be subject to adversarial data tampering. Existing methods are primarily offline and unsuitable for real-time learning. To address this issue, we first develop a first-order gradient-based algorithm that updates parameter estimates recursively using incoming data. Considering that persistent excitation (PE) conditions are difficult to satisfy in feedback control scenarios, a second-order quasi-Newton algorithm is proposed to achieve faster convergence without requiring the PE condition. For both algorithms, corresponding versions are developed to handle known and unknown tampering strategies, and their parameter estimates are proven to converge almost surely over time. In particular, the second-order algorithm ensures convergence under a signal condition that matches the minimal excitation required by classical least-squares estimation in stochastic regression models. The second-order algorithm is also extended to an adaptive control framework, providing an explicit upper bound on the tracking error for binary-output FIR systems under unknown tampering. Three numerical simulations verify the theoretical results and show that the proposed methods are robust against data tampering. Finally, the approach is validated via a vehicle emission control problem, where it effectively improves the detection accuracy of excess-emission events.

Motivation: 批发电力市场通常使用线性化的电力系统约束近似，但这种方法不考虑不等式约束，使用交流潮流进行可行性后处理可能违反无功功率、电压幅值或热极限的边界限制。需要一种能够保证交流可行性同时遵守变量边界的简化分析方法。

Method: 提出了一种增强型交流潮流实现方法，使用额外的两种母线类型（PQV和P）来帮助解决传统方法中存在的电压边界违反问题。该方法通过牺牲发电机电压设定点来修复负荷母线的电压，从而在网络中重新分配自由度。

Conclusion: 通过引入新的母线类型和重新分配自由度的方法，能够有效解决交流潮流可行性后处理中的电压边界违反问题，为电力系统运行提供更可靠的设定点。

Abstract: Wholesale power markets often use linear approximations of power system constraints. Because it does not consider inequality constraints, using AC power flow for feasibility post-processing can violate bounds on reactive power, voltage magnitudes, or thermal limits. There remains a need for a streamlined analytical approach that can guarantee AC feasibility while adhering to variable bounds. This paper suggests an augmented implementation of AC power flow that uses an additional two bus types (PQV and P) to help resolve voltage bound violations present in the traditional approach. The proposed method sacrifices the voltage setpoint at a generator in exchange for fixing the voltage at a load bus, thereby moving a degree of freedom around the network. Results on the IEEE 14-bus, 57-bus, and 300-bus test cases demonstrate how switching bus types can reduce overall network violations and help find feasible power system setpoints.

Abstract: Controllability determines whether a system's state can be guided toward any desired configuration, making it a fundamental prerequisite for designing effective control strategies. In the context of networked systems, controllability is a well-established concept. However, many real-world systems, from biological collectives to engineered infrastructures, exhibit higher-order interactions that cannot be captured by simple graphs. Moreover, the way in which agents interact and influence one another is often unknown and must be inferred from partial observations of the system. Here, we close the loop between a hypergraph representation and our recently developed hypergraph inference algorithm, THIS, to infer the underlying multibody couplings. Building on the inferred structure, we design a parsimonious controller that, given a minimal set of controllable nodes, steers the system toward a desired configuration. We validate the proposed system identification and control framework on a network of Kuramoto oscillators evolving over a hypergraph.

Abstract: Mobility systems are complex socio-technical environments influenced by multiple stakeholders with hierarchically interdependent decisions, rendering effective control and policy design inherently challenging. We bridge hierarchical game-theoretic modeling with online feedback optimization by casting urban mobility as a tri-level Stackelberg game (travelers, operators, municipality) closed in a feedback loop. The municipality iteratively updates taxes, subsidies, and operational constraints using a projected two-point (gradient-free) scheme, while lower levels respond through equilibrium computations (Frank-Wolfe for traveler equilibrium; operator best responses). This model-free pipeline enforces constraints, accommodates heterogeneous users and modes, and scales to higher-dimensional policy vectors without differentiating through equilibrium maps.
  On a real multimodal network for Zurich, Switzerland, our method attains substantially better municipal objectives than Bayesian optimization and Genetic algorithms, and identifies integration incentives that increase multimodal usage while improving both operator objectives. The results show that feedback-based regulation can steer competition toward cooperative outcomes and deliver tangible welfare gains in complex, data-rich mobility ecosystems.

Result: 不同规模网络的案例研究表明，基于目标的ADMM方法对惩罚参数选择显著更鲁棒，通过防止算法过早停止，能持续获得更接近集中式最优基准的解。

Conclusion: OB-ADMM方法在解决网络微电网能源管理问题时表现出更好的鲁棒性，能够有效应对ADMM算法对惩罚参数敏感的问题。

Abstract: The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a powerful algorithm for solving decentralized optimization problems including networked microgrid energy management (NetMEM). However, its performance is highly sensitive to the selection of its penalty parameter \r{ho}, which can lead to slow convergence, suboptimal solutions, or even algorithm divergence. This paper evaluates and compares three district ADMM formulations to solve the NetMEM problem, which explore different methods to determine appropriate stopping points, aiming to yield high-quality solutions. Furthermore, an adaptive penalty heuristic is also incorporated into each method to analyze its potential impact on ADMM performance. Different case studies on networks of varying sizes demonstrate that an objective-based ADMM approach, denominated as OB-ADMM, is significantly more robust to the choice of \r{ho}, consistently yielding solutions closer to the centralized optimal benchmark by preventing premature algorithm stopping.

Abstract: This work presents a global-to-local, task-aware fault detection and identification (FDI) framework for multi-spacecraft systems conducting collaborative inspection missions in low Earth orbit. The inspection task is represented by a global information-driven cost functional that integrates the sensor model, spacecraft poses, and mission-level information-gain objectives. This formulation links guidance, control, and FDI by using the same cost function to drive both global task allocation and local sensing or motion decisions. Fault detection is achieved through comparisons between expected and observed task metrics, while higher-order cost-gradient measures enable the identification of faults among sensors, actuators, and state estimators. An adaptive thresholding mechanism captures the time-varying inspection geometry and dynamic mission conditions. Simulation results for representative multi-spacecraft inspection scenarios demonstrate the reliability of fault localization and classification under uncertainty, providing a unified, information-driven foundation for resilient autonomous inspection architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能驱动的数据中心快速增长导致电网负荷集中，造成输电拥堵和可靠性威胁，同时太阳能和风能的间歇性需要灵活资源来维持电网稳定。

Method: 开发最优潮流模型，共同优化发电调度、安全储备和灵活数据中心负载，在改进的IEEE 73总线系统上进行案例研究。

Result: 不灵活的数据中心布局会导致严重的输电违规（线路过载达30.1%），而启用空间灵活性可以缓解这些违规并恢复系统可行性，同时将太阳能弃电减少高达61.0%。

Conclusion: 数据中心的空间灵活性是推迟输电升级和增强可再生能源利用的可行方法。

Abstract: Data centers are facilities housing computing infrastructure for processing and storing digital information. The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is driving unprecedented growth in data center capacity, with global electricity demand from data centers projected to double by 2026. This growth creates substantial challenges for power transmission networks, as large concentrated loads can cause congestion and threaten grid reliability. Meanwhile, the intermittent nature of solar and wind generation requires flexible resources to maintain grid reliability and minimize curtailment. This paper assesses whether data center spatial flexibility-the ability to migrate computational workloads geographically-can serve as a grid resource to address these challenges. An optimal power flow model is developed to co-optimize generation dispatch, security reserves, and flexible data center loads. Case studies on a modified IEEE 73-bus system show that inflexible data center placement can lead to severe transmission violations, with line overloads reaching 30.1%. Enabling spatial flexibility mitigates these violations in the studied scenarios and restores system feasibility. This flexibility also reduces solar curtailment by up to 61.0% by strategically reallocating load to solar-rich areas. The results suggest that spatial flexibility offers a viable approach to defer transmission upgrades and enhance renewable utilization.

Abstract: From organisms to machines, autonomous systems rely on measured sensory cues to estimate unknown information about themselves or their environment. For nonlinear systems, carefully selected sensor motion can be exploited to extract information that is otherwise unavailable, i.e. active sensing. Empirical, yet mathematically rigorous, tools are needed to (1) quantify how sensor movement can contribute to estimation performance, and (2) leverage this knowledge to improve state estimates. Here, we introduce "BOUNDS: Bounding Observability for Uncertain Nonlinear Dynamic Systems", and Python package pybounds, which can discover patterns of sensor motion that increase information for individual state variables. Crucially, it is suitable for partially observable nonlinear systems, accounts for sensor noise, and can be applied to either simulated or observed trajectories. We demonstrate BOUNDS through a case study on a flying agent with limited sensors, showing how active sensing can be leveraged to estimate key variables such as ground speed, altitude, and ambient wind direction. Finally, we present a framework to refine sporadic estimates from bouts of active sensing that combines data-driven state and observability estimation from artificial neural networks with model-based estimation, which we call the Augmented Information Kalman Filter (AI-KF). We validate our framework using altitude estimation given GPS-denied data from an outdoor quadcopter flight. Collectively, our work will help decode active sensing strategies and inform the design of estimation algorithms in sensorimotor systems.

Abstract: Successive convex programming (SCP) is a powerful class of direct optimization methods, known for its polynomial complexity and computational efficiency, making it particularly suitable for autonomous applications. Direct methods are also referred to as ``discretize-then-optimize'' with discretization being a fundamental solution step. A key step in all practical direct methods is mesh refinement, which aims to refine the solution resolution by enhancing the precision and quality of discretization techniques through strategic distribution and placement of mesh/grid points. We propose a novel method to enhance adaptive mesh refinement stability by integrating it with a nonlinearity-index-based trust-region strategy within the SCP framework for spacecraft trajectory design. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through solving minimum-fuel, low-thrust missions, including a benchmark Earth-to-Asteroid rendezvous and an Earth-Moon L2 Halo-to-Halo transfer using the Circular Restricted Three-Body (CR3BP) model.

Abstract: The high-temperature glassblowing-fabricated micro hemispherical resonator (MHR) exhibits high symmetry and high Q-value for precision inertial navigation. However, MHR design entails a comprehensive evaluation of multiple possible configurations and demands extremely time-consuming simulation of key parameters combination. To address this problem, this paper proposed a rapid prediction method of modal frequency and actual anchor radius of designed MHR using an improved Transformer-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for rapid design sizing. High-temperature-induced softening deformation at the anchor point reduces the actual anchor radius below the designed value. By varying key parameters such as resonator height, anchor radius and edge thickness, finite element glassblowing simulation and modal analyse were conducted to obtain the first six modal frequencies and actual anchor radius. To address regression prediction challenges with limited data, dual multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanisms replaced the transformer's standard Feed Forward Network, to improve hidden information capture for high-accuracy predictions of modal frequencies and anchor radius. By checking fabricating feasibility of anchor radius and allowing rapid modal characteristics evaluation without interference, ablation and comparative experiments validated the method's superiority, as an effective support of MHR design. Design optimization experiments demonstrate a prediction accuracy of 96.35%, with computational time reduced to 1/48,000 of traditional finite element methods, significantly improving design efficiency. This study offers a new paradigm for intelligent Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) device design under complex process conditions.

Abstract: The Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother are optimal for state estimation in linear dynamic systems. With nonlinear systems, the challenge consists in how to propagate uncertainty through the state transitions and output function. For the case of a neural network model, we enable accurate uncertainty propagation using a recent state-of-the-art analytic formula for computing the mean and covariance of a deep neural network with Gaussian input. We argue that cross entropy is a more appropriate performance metric than RMSE for evaluating the accuracy of filters and smoothers. We demonstrate the superiority of our method for state estimation on a stochastic Lorenz system and a Wiener system, and find that our method enables more optimal linear quadratic regulation when the state estimate is used for feedback.

Abstract: With the explosive advancement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the security of efficient UAV networks has become increasingly critical. Owing to the open nature of its communication environment, illegitimate malicious UAVs (MUs) can infer the position of the source UAV (SU) by analyzing received signals, thus compromising the SU location privacy. To protect the SU location privacy while ensuring efficient communication with legitimate receiving UAVs (RUs), we propose an Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (ARIS)-assisted covert communication scheme based on virtual partitioning and artificial noise (AN). Specifically, we design a novel ARIS architecture integrated with an AN module. This architecture dynamically partitions its reflecting elements into multiple sub-regions: one subset is optimized to enhance the communication rate between the SU and RUs, while the other subset generates AN to interfere with the localization of the SU by MUs. We first derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization with received signal strength (RSS), based on which, we establish a joint optimization framework for communication enhancement and localization interference. Subsequently, we derive and validate the optimal ARIS partitioning and power allocation under average channel conditions. Finally, tailored optimization methods are proposed for the reflection precoding and AN design of the two partitions. Simulation results validate that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed scheme significantly increases the localization error of the SU by MUs while maintaining efficient communication between the SU and RUs, thereby effectively protecting the SU location privacy.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that connects sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and the iterative linear-parameter-varying model predictive control (LPV-MPC) technique. Using the differential formulation of the LPV-MPC, we demonstrate how SQP and LPV-MPC can be unified through a specific choice of scheduling variable and the 2nd Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) embedding technique and compare their convergence properties. This enables the unification of the zero-order approach of SQP with the LPV-MPC scheduling technique to enhance the computational efficiency of stochastic and robust MPC problems. To demonstrate our findings, we compare the two schemes in a simulation example. Finally, we present real-time feasibility and performance of the zeroorder LPV-MPC approach by applying it to Gaussian process (GP)-based MPC for autonomous racing with real-world experiments.

Conclusion: 提出的情境感知能量管理策略能够有效平衡及时数据收集与能量节约的冲突目标。

Abstract: The operational lifetime of energy-harvesting wireless sensor nodes is limited by availability of the energy source and the capacity of the installed energy buffer. When a sensor node depletes its energy reserves, manual intervention is often required to resume node operation. While lowering the duty cycle would help extend the network lifetime, this is often undesirable, especially in time-critical applications, where rapid collection and dissemination of information is vital. In this paper, we propose a context-aware energy management policy that helps balance the two opposing objectives of timely data collection and dissemination with energy conservation. We capture these objectives through the Value of Information (VoI) of observations made by a sensor node and the State of Energy (SoE) of the energy buffer. We formulate the energy management policy as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem which computes device sampling and transmission frequencies to maximize a defined utility criterion over a finite, receding, time-horizon. In the process, we also develop a unique mathematical representation for VoI, that adequately captures aspects related to continuity in monitoring, urgency of dissemination, and representation of the phenomena being observed. In the end, we use data collected from a real-world flash flood event, to evaluate our decision framework across multiple scenarios of energy availability.

Abstract: This paper studies targeted opinion formation in multi-agent systems evolving over signed, time-varying directed graphs. The dynamics of each agent's state follow a Laplacian-based update rule driven by both cooperative and antagonistic interactions in the presence of exogenous factors. We formulate these exogenous factors as external control inputs and establish a suitable controller design methodology enabling collective opinion to converge to any desired steady-state configuration, superseding the natural emergent clustering or polarization behavior imposed by persistently structurally balanced influential root nodes. Our approach leverages upper Dini derivative analysis and Grönwall-type inequalities to establish exponential convergence for opinion magnitude towards the desired steady state configuration on networks with uniform quasi-strong $δ$-connectivity. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through extensive numerical simulations.

Abstract: Stochastic dynamical systems have emerged as fundamental models across numerous application domains, providing powerful mathematical representations for capturing uncertain system behavior. In this paper, we address the problem of runtime safety and reach-avoid probability prediction for discrete-time stochastic systems with online observations, i.e., estimating the probability that the system satisfies a given safety or reach-avoid specification. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on offline models, we propose a framework that incorporates real-time observations to dynamically refine probability estimates for safety and reach-avoid events. By introducing observation-aware barrier functions, our method adaptively updates probability bounds as new observations are collected, combining efficient offline computation with online backward iteration. This approach enables rigorous and responsive prediction of safety and reach-avoid probabilities under uncertainty. In addition to the theoretical guarantees, experimental results on benchmark systems demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: HVDC网络中的电谐振现象在特定条件下显著，但网络配置通常能提供足够阻尼，且谐振对换流器参数变化敏感。

Abstract: HVDC networks offer several advantages over traditional HVAC systems, particularly for long-distance power transmission and integration of renewable energy sources, such as reduced losses and enhanced stability and control, but also increase the risk of oscillations. This study investigates electrical resonant phenomena associated with HVDC stations through numerical EMT simulations. The findings indicate that electrical resonance is primarily pronounced in weak networks with long cables, as confirmed by the Nyquist criterion applied to frequency responses. Two real cases were successfully simulated in the time domain by introducing network changes, such as temporary faults and alterations in network's power strength, to activate the identified resonances. Notably, in a strong network with short cables, electrical resonance occurred alongside interactions between the network and the converter's protection system. The analysis of voltage waveforms revealed that the amplitude of the induced resonant harmonic dissipates quickly, indicating sufficient damping in the network configuration. Furthermore, the study confirmed the network's sensitivity to changes in converter parameters modeled using available MMC model.

Abstract: We propose decentralized k-hop Prescribed Performance State and Input Observers for heterogeneous multi-agent systems subject to bounded external disturbances. In the proposed input/state observer, each agent estimates the state and input of agents located two or more hops away using only local information exchanged with 1-hop neighbors, while guaranteeing that transient estimation errors satisfy predefined performance bounds. Conditions are established under which the input observer can be omitted, allowing the state observer convergence to be independent of the input estimates. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that if a closed-loop controller with full state knowledge achieves the control objective and the estimation-based closed-loop system is set-Input to State Stable (set-ISS) with respect to the goal set, then the estimated states can be used to achieve the system objective with an arbitrarily small worst-case error governed by the accuracy of the states estimates. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed approach.

Abstract: The concept of a security index quantifies the minimum number of components that must be compromised to carry out an undetectable attack. This metric enables system operators to quantify each component's security risk and implement countermeasures. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven security index that can be computed solely from input/output data when the system model is unknown. We show a sufficient condition under which the data-driven security index coincides with the model-based security index, which implies that the exact risk level of each component can be identified solely from the data. We provide an algorithm for computing the data-driven security index. Although computing this index is NP-hard, we derive a polynomial-time computable upper bound. Numerical examples on vehicle platooning illustrate the efficacy and limitations of the proposed index and algorithms.

Abstract: This paper develops robust inference methods for predictive regressions that address key challenges posed by endogenously persistent or heavy-tailed regressors, as well as persistent volatility in errors. Building on the Cauchy estimation framework, we propose two novel tests: one based on $t$-statistic group inference and the other employing a hybrid approach that combines Cauchy and OLS estimation. These methods effectively mitigate size distortions that commonly arise in standard inference procedures under endogeneity, near nonstationarity, heavy tails, and persistent volatility. The proposed tests are simple to implement and applicable to both continuous- and discrete-time models. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate favorable finite-sample performance across a range of realistic settings. An empirical application examines the predictability of excess stock returns using the dividend-price and earnings-price ratios as predictors. The results suggest that the dividend-price ratio possesses predictive power, whereas the earnings-price ratio does not significantly forecast returns.

Abstract: Power systems modeling and planning has long leveraged mathematical programming for its ability to provide optimality and feasibility guarantees. One feature that has been recognized in the optimization literature since the 1970s is the existence and meaning of multiple exact optimal and near-optimal solutions, which we call alternative solutions. In power systems modeling, the use of alternative solutions has been limited to energy system optimization modeling (ESOM) applications and modeling to generate alternative (MGA) techniques. We present three key results about alternative solutions for power systems modeling. First, we give a perspective, based on sublevel sets and projection, for characterizing alternative solutions as a facet of general optimization theory. Second, we include pointers to alternative solution generation methods and tools beyond MGA-style techniques. Third, we demonstrate the use cases for alternative solutions in power system modeling on the fundamental optimal power flow problem.

Abstract: This paper presents a convex optimization-based framework for synthesizing time-varying controlled invariant funnels and associated feedback control around a given nominal trajectory for nonlinear systems subject to bounded disturbances. Nonlinearities are modeled using incremental quadratic constraints, including Lipschitz, L-smooth, and sector-bounded nonlinearities. Funnel invariance is ensured via a DLMI. Together with pointwise-in-time LMIs for state and input constraints, we formulate a continuous-time funnel synthesis problem. To solve it using numerical optimal control techniques, the DLMI is reformulated into a differential matrix equality (DME) and an LMI, where the DME acts as a funnel dynamics equation. We explore different formulations of these funnel dynamics. Continuous-time constraint satisfaction is addressed through two convex methods: one based on intermediate constraint-checking points, and another using a successive convexification method with subgradients to handle nondifferentiable maximum eigenvalue functions. Theoretical justification is provided for the existence of a measurable and integrable subgradient for the latter. The method is demonstrated on two numerical examples: the control of a unicycle and a 6-degree-of-freedom quadrotor for obstacle avoidance.

Abstract: Mean-field games with common noise provide a powerful framework for modeling the collective behavior of large populations subject to shared randomness, such as systemic risk in finance or environmental shocks in economics. These problems can be reformulated as McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) in a random environment, where the coefficients depend on the conditional law of the state given the common noise. Existing numerical methods, however, are largely limited to cases where interactions depend only on expectations or low-order moments, and therefore cannot address the general setting of full distributional dependence.
  In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based algorithm for solving MV-FBSDEs with common noise and general mean-field interactions. Building on fictitious play, our method iteratively solves conditional FBSDEs with fixed distributions, where the conditional law is efficiently represented using signatures, and then updates the distribution through supervised learning. Deep neural networks are employed both to solve the conditional FBSDEs and to approximate the distribution-dependent coefficients, enabling scalability to high-dimensional problems. Under suitable assumptions, we establish convergence in terms of the fictitious play iterations, with error controlled by the supervised learning step. Numerical experiments, including a distribution-dependent mean-field game with common noise, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Embedding deep neural networks (NNs) into mixed-integer programs (MIPs) is attractive for decision making with learned constraints, yet state-of-the-art monolithic linearisations blow up in size and quickly become intractable. In this paper, we introduce a novel dual-decomposition framework that relaxes the single coupling equality u=x with an augmented Lagrange multiplier and splits the problem into a vanilla MIP and a constrained NN block. Each part is tackled by the solver that suits it best-branch and cut for the MIP subproblem, first-order optimisation for the NN subproblem-so the model remains modular, the number of integer variables never grows with network depth, and the per-iteration cost scales only linearly with the NN size. On the public \textsc{SurrogateLIB} benchmark, our method proves \textbf{scalable}, \textbf{modular}, and \textbf{adaptable}: it runs \(120\times\) faster than an exact Big-M formulation on the largest test case; the NN sub-solver can be swapped from a log-barrier interior step to a projected-gradient routine with no code changes and identical objective value; and swapping the MLP for an LSTM backbone still completes the full optimisation in 47s without any bespoke adaptation.

Conclusion: 基于Grassmann流形的几何鲁棒最小二乘方法为鲁棒优化提供了新的视角，在数据驱动的控制应用中展现出优越的性能。

Abstract: The paper studies a geometrically robust least-squares problem that extends classical and norm-based robust formulations. Rather than minimizing residual error for fixed or perturbed data, we interpret least-squares as enforcing approximate subspace inclusion between measured and true data spaces. The uncertainty in this geometric relation is modeled as a metric ball on the Grassmannian manifold, leading to a min-max problem over Euclidean and manifold variables. The inner maximization admits a closed-form solution, enabling an efficient algorithm with a transparent geometric interpretation. Applied to robust finite-horizon linear-quadratic tracking in data-enabled predictive control, the method improves upon existing robust least-squares formulations, achieving stronger robustness and favorable scaling under small uncertainty.

Abstract: The rapid integration of renewable energy resources, such as tidal and photovoltaic (PV) power, coupled with the growing deployment of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, necessitates coordinated planning for coastal urban distribution networks (DN). This paper presents a tri-layer distributionally robust optimization framework to jointly optimize the sitting of PV-storage-EV stations (PSES) and the configuration of coastal DNs, addressing uncertainties related to power load, PV generation, and EV charging demands. At the upper layer, optimal PSES siting and network topology decisions are made to minimize total investment and operational costs. The middle-layer formulation tackles worst case uncertainty scenarios via the optimal power flow model, utilizing ambiguity sets to capture correlated uncertainties. To handle non-convexities introduced by binary variables for energy storage systems, we propose and rigorously prove the exactness of a novel relaxation approach. At the lower layer, considering the dynamic pricing driven by tidal energy fluctuations, operational decisions-including electricity procurement and carbon emissions are optimized. An inexact column-and-constraint generation (i-CCG) algorithm is developed for efficient problem-solving. Numerical results from a realistic 47-node coastal DN in China illustrate that the proposed method effectively reduces costs and ensures robust, low-carbon planning under substantial uncertainties.

Abstract: The goal of experiment design is to select the inputs of a dynamical system in such a way that the resulting data contain sufficient information for data-driven modeling and control. This paper investigates the problem of experiment design for continuous-time systems under piecewise constant input signals. To obviate the need for measuring time derivatives of (data) trajectories, we introduce a generalized filtering framework. Our main result is to establish conditions on the input and the filter functions under which the filtered data are informative for system identification, i.e., they satisfy a certain rank condition. The proposed framework encompasses several filter functions that have already appeared in the literature. Building on the proposed filtering framework, we develop an experiment design procedure where the input signal is designed online during system operation. This method is shown to be sample efficient, in the sense that it deals with the least possible number of filtered data samples for system identification.

Abstract: We propose an optimization model where a parking lot manager (PLM) can aggregate parked EV batteries to provide virtual energy storage services that are provably robust under uncertain EV departures and state-of-charge caps. Our formulation yields a data-driven convex optimization problem where a prosumer community agrees on a contract with the PLM for the provision of storage services over a finite horizon. Leveraging recent results in the scenario approach, we certify out-of-sample constraint safety. Furthermore, we enable a tunable profit-risk trade-off through scenario relaxation and extend our model to account for robustness to adversarial perturbations and distributional shifts over Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets. All the approaches are accompanied by tight finite-sample certificates. Numerical studies demonstrate the out-of-sample and out-of-distribution constraint satisfaction of our proposed model compared to the developed theoretical guarantees, showing their effectiveness and potential in robust and efficient virtual energy services.

Conclusion: 提出的二维压力积分方法有效解决了交通灯等待优化问题，为特定分布情况下的最优控制策略提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: We give a rigorous solution of an optimisation problem of minimizing the expected delay caused by encountering a red traffic light on a road journey. The problem incorporates simple constraints on maximum speed, acceleration and braking rates, and depends on the assumed distribution of the remaining time until the traffic light will turn green, after it is first noticed. We assume that this distribution has a bounded and non-increasing density, which is natural since this holds for the law of the excess time in any stationary renewal process. In two special cases, where this distribution is either Uniform or Exponential, we give a complete characterisation of all possible combinations of phases of maximum acceleration, maximum speed, maximum braking, following an Euler--Lagrange curve, and standing stationary at the traffic light, which can make up an optimal solution. The key technique is to write the problem in terms of a two-dimensional pressure integral, so that the problem becomes analogous to filling a tank with a given quantity of liquid.

Abstract: Optimal control of the future is the next frontier for AI. Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning or online learning. While powerful, these frameworks for learning are mathematically distinct from Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, which has been the workhorse for the recent technological achievements in AI. We therefore build on the prior work of prospective learning, an extension of PAC learning (without control) in non-stationary environments (De Silva et al., 2023; Silva et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2026). Here, we further extend the PAC learning framework to address learning and control in non-stationary environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Control'', we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective control, foraging, which is a canonical task for any mobile agent, be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/neurodata/ProspectiveLearningwithControl.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of adding noise to the training set classes in classification tasks using the BCOPS algorithm (Balanced and Conformal Optimized Prediction Sets), proposed by Guan & Tibshirani (2022). The BCOPS algorithm is an application of conformal prediction combined with a machine learning method to construct prediction sets such that the probability of the true class being included in the prediction set for a test observation meets a specified coverage guarantee. An observation is considered an outlier if its true class is not present in the training set. The study employs both synthetic and real datasets and conducts experiments to evaluate the prediction abstention rate for outlier observations and the model's robustness in this previously untested scenario. The results indicate that the addition of noise, even in small amounts, can have a significant effect on model performance.

Abstract: Active statistical inference is a new method for inference with AI-assisted data collection. Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research.

Abstract: Self-consuming generative models have received significant attention over the last few years. In this paper, we study a self-consuming generative model with heterogeneous preferences that is a generalization of the model in Ferbach et al. (2024). The model is retrained round by round using real data and its previous-round synthetic outputs. The asymptotic behavior of the retraining dynamics is investigated across four regimes using different techniques including the nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theory. Our analyses improve upon that of Ferbach et al. (2024) and provide convergence results in settings where the well-known Banach contraction mapping arguments do not apply. Stability and non-stability results regarding the retraining dynamics are also given.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly central to scientific workflows, yet their systematic use and interpretation require a proper understanding of their limitations through rigorous validation. Classic approaches struggle with scalability, statistical power, or interpretability when applied to high-dimensional data, making it difficult to certify the reliability of these models in realistic, high-dimensional scientific settings. Here, we propose the use of the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM), a learning based approach to goodness-of-fit testing inspired by the Neyman-Pearson construction, to test generative networks trained on high-dimensional scientific data. We demonstrate the performance of NPLM for validation in two benchmark cases: generative models trained on mixtures of Gaussian models with increasing dimensionality, and a public end-to-end generator for the Large Hadron Collider called FlashSim, trained on jet data, typical in the field of high-energy physics. We demonstrate that the NPLM can serve as a powerful validation method while also providing a means to diagnose sub-optimally modeled regions of the data.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching approaches to generative modeling have shown promise in domains where the state space is continuous, such as image generation or protein folding & design, and discrete, exemplified by diffusion large language models. They offer a natural fit when the number of elements in a state is fixed in advance (e.g. images), but require ad hoc solutions when, for example, the length of a response from a large language model, or the number of amino acids in a protein chain is not known a priori.
  Here we propose Branching Flows, a generative modeling framework that, like diffusion and flow matching approaches, transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. But in Branching Flows, the elements in the state evolve over a forest of binary trees, branching and dying stochastically with rates that are learned by the model. This allows the model to control, during generation, the number of elements in the sequence. We also show that Branching Flows can compose with any flow matching base process on discrete sets, continuous Euclidean spaces, smooth manifolds, and `multimodal' product spaces that mix these components. We demonstrate this in three domains: small molecule generation (multimodal), antibody sequence generation (discrete), and protein backbone generation (multimodal), and show that Branching Flows is a capable distribution learner with a stable learning objective, and that it enables new capabilities.

*Antonio Di Noia,Federico Ravenda,Antonietta Mira*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部自适应邻域尺寸的维度降维方法，通过内在维度估计器优化局部邻域结构，显著改进现有投影方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于局部嵌入的非线性维度降维方法需要手动调整邻域数量和降维维度，这些选择严重影响嵌入质量，需要自动化优化方案。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task in modern data science. Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用去噪器，用于从已知噪声水平但未知噪声分布的含噪测量中恢复信号分布。相比基于Tweedie公式的贝叶斯最优去噪器，该方法在分布恢复方面有数量级提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统去噪方法通常需要知道噪声分布，但在实际应用中噪声分布往往是未知的。本文旨在开发对信号和噪声分布都具有鲁棒性的通用去噪器，重点关注恢复整个信号分布而非单个信号实例。

Method: 提出基于最优传输理论的分布去噪器，通过修正贝叶斯最优去噪器的收缩程度来实现更优的分布恢复。具体提出了两种去噪器T1和T2，分别采用不同程度的分布收缩策略。

Result: 所提出的去噪器在匹配广义矩和密度函数方面达到O(σ^4)和O(σ^6)的精度，相比贝叶斯最优去噪器有数量级提升。这些去噪器在逼近Monge-Ampère方程时具有更高阶精度。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在分布恢复任务中，采用比贝叶斯最优去噪器更温和的分布收缩策略可以获得显著更好的性能。所提出的通用去噪器对广泛的信号和噪声分布都具有鲁棒性，可通过分数匹配高效实现。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of denoising from noisy measurements where only the noise level is known, not the noise distribution. In multi-dimensions, independent noise $Z$ corrupts the signal $X$, resulting in the noisy measurement $Y = X + σZ$, where $σ\in (0, 1)$ is a known noise level. Our goal is to recover the underlying signal distribution $P_X$ from denoising $P_Y$. We propose and analyze universal denoisers that are agnostic to a wide range of signal and noise distributions. Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(σ^4)$ and $O(σ^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Ampère equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.
  Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \[ \mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + σ^2 \nabla \log q(y), \] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \[ \mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \frac{σ^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y), \] \[ \mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \frac{σ^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y) - \frac{σ^4}{8} \nabla \left( \frac{1}{2} \| \nabla \log q(y) \|^2 + \nabla \cdot \nabla \log q(y) \right) . \]

### [122] [Bridging Natural Language and ASP: A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs and AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08715)
*Connar Hite,Sean Saud,Raef Taha,Nayim Rahman,Tanvir Atahary,Scott Douglass,Tarek Taha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LLM和AMR图将无约束英语翻译成ASP程序的方法，用于解决逻辑谜题，生成完整的ASP程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP是一种强大的组合问题解决工具，但需要学习语法。随着非编程人员需要与代码交互的需求增加，需要一种将自然语言转换为ASP程序的方法。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后通过AMR图解析简化语言并系统生成ASP约束。

Result: 系统成功创建了完整的ASP程序来解决组合逻辑问题，相比现有方法最小化了LLM的作用。

Conclusion: 这是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题解决系统的重大第一步。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Motivation: ARC-AGI是衡量通用人工智能的基准测试，虽然人类能轻松解决，但对最先进AI系统仍极具挑战。受神经科学和心理学中人类智能建模方法的启发，旨在开发认知合理的求解器。

Method: 使用神经符号方法，基于向量符号代数(VSA)集成系统1直觉和系统2推理。通过面向对象的程序合成，利用VSA表示抽象对象、指导解决方案搜索，并实现样本高效的神经学习。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-1-Train上得分10.8%，在ARC-AGI-1-Eval上得分3.0%。在更简单的基准测试上表现良好：Sort-of-ARC得分94.5%，1D-ARC得分83.1%（后者以极小计算成本超越GPT-4）。

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSA应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了迄今为止最认知合理的ARC-AGI求解器，在保持计算效率的同时实现了有竞争力的性能。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ijoffe/ARC-VSA-2025.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QDIN是一种将强化学习系统设计为可查询推理引擎的统一架构，通过专门的神经网络模块处理不同类型的查询（策略、可达性、路径、比较），实现了推理准确性与控制性能的解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统强化学习仅关注奖励最大化的范式，探索将RL系统构建为能够回答环境多样性查询的推理引擎，充分利用训练后智能体隐含的环境知识（可达性、距离、价值、动力学等）。

Method: 引入查询条件确定性推理网络(QDIN)，为不同类型的查询设计专门的神经网络模块，将查询作为一等公民处理，每个推理模式都有优化的专用架构。

Result: 发现推理准确性与控制性能存在根本性解耦：推理准确率可达接近完美水平（99%可达性IoU），而控制性能仍保持次优（31%回报）；专门化架构在推理任务上优于统一模型和后提取方法，同时保持竞争力的控制性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为从设计之初就作为可查询知识库的RL系统建立了研究议程，对可解释性、验证和人类-AI协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

*Yang You,Ufuk Çakır,Alex Schutz,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经网络表示POMDP值函数的Neural Value Iteration算法，解决了传统α向量方法在大规模POMDP中的计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于α向量的POMDP求解器在大规模问题上计算成本过高，因为每个α向量都是|S|维的，Bellman备份操作变得难以处理。

Method: 利用PWLC特性，将POMDP值函数表示为有限个神经网络的集合，结合神经网络泛化能力和经典值迭代框架，提出Neural Value Iteration算法。

Result: 该方法在现有离线求解器无法处理的大规模POMDP中仍能获得接近最优的解。

Conclusion: 神经网络表示为大规模POMDP规划提供了可行的替代方案，结合了神经网络的泛化能力和传统值迭代的优势。

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

TL;DR: 提出了单向认知优化（UCO）方法，通过多轮交互强化学习解决LLM作为智能导师时无法感知学生认知状态和动态调整教学策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在教学中只能学习表面教学模式，缺乏动态适应能力；现有强化学习方法无法区分学生是否真正理解，也无法感知学生认知状态的变化。

Method: 使用多轮交互强化学习范式，包含两个协同奖励函数：进步奖励评估学生从困惑到理解的认知进步，支架奖励动态识别学生的最近发展区（ZPD）。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型优于所有同等规模的基线模型，性能与先进闭源模型相当。

Conclusion: UCO方法有效解决了LLM作为智能导师时的认知状态感知和动态适应问题，提升了教学效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Conclusion: Lumine在不同世界和交互动态中展现出有效性，标志着在开放环境中开发通用智能体的重要进展。

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

Conclusion: 需要将生物声学AI从通用模式识别重新概念化为不同递归认知形式之间的外交相遇，这对模型设计、评估框架和研究方法都有重要影响。

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应能力，限制了在复杂现实环境中的实用性。

Result: 在短期和长期数据集上的广泛实验表明，AlphaCast在预测准确性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过重新定义预测为交互过程，实现了人类智慧与LLM智能的逐步协作，显著提升了时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于假设论证（ABA）是强大的结构化论证形式，但在稳定语义下精确计算扩展对于大型框架是难处理的，需要可扩展的近似推理方法。

Method: 将ABA框架建模为依赖图，编码假设、声明和规则作为节点，使用异质边标签区分支持、推导和攻击关系；提出了两种GNN架构ABAGCN和ABAGAT，分别堆叠残差异质卷积层或注意力层来学习节点嵌入。

Result: ABAGCN和ABAGAT在ICCMA实例上实现了高达0.71的节点级F1分数，优于从抽象论证文献中改编的最先进GNN基线；开发的多项式时间扩展重构算法在小型ABA框架上F1超过0.85，在大型框架上保持约0.58的F1。

Conclusion: 这项工作为结构化论证中的可扩展近似推理开辟了新途径，证明了GNN在ABA中近似可信接受性的有效性。

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过渐进式搜索增强LLM推理能力的强大架构特征。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

TL;DR: MAKER系统通过极端任务分解和微代理投票机制，首次实现了超过100万步LLM推理的零错误任务执行，突破了LLM在长程任务中的扩展瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs虽然在推理和工具使用方面取得突破，但由于持续的错误率，无法扩展到人类、组织和社会级别的长程任务执行规模。

Method: 采用极端任务分解策略，将复杂任务分解为可由专注微代理处理的子任务，并通过多代理投票机制实现高效的逐步骤错误校正。

Result: 成功解决了超过100万步LLM推理的任务且零错误，理论上可扩展到更大规模。

Conclusion: 大规模分解代理过程（MDAPs）可能比单纯改进当前LLMs更有效地解决组织和社会级别的问题。

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

*Zezhen Ding,Zhen Tan,Jiheng Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OR-R1是一个数据高效的训练框架，用于自动化优化建模和求解。它通过监督微调和测试时组相对策略优化的两阶段设计，仅需1/10的数据量就能达到67.7%的平均求解准确率，超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的优化建模方法需要大量标注或合成数据，成本高且可扩展性差。需要开发数据效率更高的自动化方法。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：1) 监督微调从有限标注数据中学习问题建模和代码生成模式；2) 测试时组相对策略优化利用大量未标注数据提升能力和一致性。

Result: OR-R1达到67.7%的平均求解准确率，仅需ORLM方法1/10的数据量，超越ORLM达4.2%。TGRPO额外带来3.1%-6.4%的准确率提升，将单次尝试与多次尝试性能差距从13%缩小到7%。

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化运筹优化问题建模和求解提供了鲁棒、可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，降低了工业应用的专业知识和数据门槛。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Argus的运行时韧性导向框架，用于增强端到端自动驾驶系统的安全性，通过持续监控轨迹和危险缓解来防止安全违规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在公共道路上部署时会面临各种驾驶危险，需要具备持续监控危险并自适应应对潜在安全违规的能力，以在复杂驾驶场景中保持稳健驾驶行为。

Method: Argus框架持续监控ADS生成的轨迹，当EGO车辆被认为不安全时，通过危险缓解器无缝接管控制。该框架与TCP、UniAD和VAD三种最先进的端到端ADS集成。

Result: Argus有效提升了ADS的韧性，平均将驾驶分数提高了150.30%，防止了高达64.38%的违规行为，且额外时间开销很小。

Conclusion: Argus框架能够高效地增强自动驾驶系统的韧性，显著改善驾驶性能并预防安全违规，为复杂驾驶场景下的安全运行提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

### [137] [History-Aware Reasoning for GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09127)
*Ziwei Wang,Leyang Yang,Xiaoxuan Tang,Sheng Zhou,Dajun Chen,Wei Jiang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了历史感知推理框架HAR，通过反思学习增强GUI代理的短期记忆能力，解决现有GUI代理在长时程任务中历史交互感知不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在显式推理中表现出弱短期记忆，将链式交互视为离散屏幕理解，无法感知历史交互，这限制了GUI自动化的性能。

Method: 构建反思学习场景、合成定制修正指南、设计混合RL奖励函数，开发了HAR-GUI-3B端到端模型，将推理模式从历史无关转变为历史感知。

Result: 在多个GUI相关基准测试中的综合评估证明了该方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HAR框架成功增强了GUI代理的短期记忆能力和屏幕细节感知，为长时程GUI任务提供了更可靠的推理能力。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProBench是一个全面的移动GUI代理基准测试，包含200多个挑战性任务，通过引入过程相关任务和专门的评估方法，解决了现有基准仅关注最终状态而忽略中间步骤的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理基准测试仅通过检查最终屏幕状态来评估任务完成情况，但GUI操作任务包含多个链式步骤，且关键信息不一定呈现在最后几页中。准确自动捕获过程信息仍是一个开放挑战。

Method: 在传统状态相关任务评估基础上，扩展数据集包含过程相关任务，并设计专门的评估方法。引入过程提供器自动提供准确的过程信息，实现对代理性能的精确评估。

Result: 对先进GUI代理的评估揭示了它们在真实世界GUI场景中的显著局限性。这些缺陷在多样化模型中普遍存在，包括大规模通用模型和较小的GUI专用模型。

Conclusion: 详细的错误分析揭示了几个普遍问题，为未来改进指明了具体方向。ProBench为GUI代理的全面评估提供了更准确的方法。

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练简洁性奖励模型(CRM)的流程，通过新颖的简洁性奖励函数(CRF)来解决大型推理模型(LRMs)中存在的过度思考问题，在提高推理效果的同时减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型(如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI o1)经常生成冗长的响应，包含冗余或不相关的推理步骤(过度思考现象)，这显著增加了计算成本。现有的长度惩罚方法存在长度崩溃和训练崩溃问题。

Method: 提出了训练简洁性奖励模型(CRM)的流程来评估推理路径的简洁性，并设计了新颖的简洁性奖励函数(CRF)，明确建立了结果奖励与简洁性分数之间的依赖关系。

Result: 在五个数学基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Qwen2.5-7B上实现了8.1%的准确率提升和19.9%的响应令牌长度减少，并且在Llama和Mistral等其他LLMs上也有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法从理论上证明了新奖励在方差减少和改进收敛性方面的优势，在实践中证明了其在提高推理效果和令牌效率方面的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在核心能力建立后才进行价值观对齐，导致模型容易失准且缺乏深层次价值体系。在大模型能力开始超越人类的背景下，需要从根本上改变训练方式

Method: 重新设计训练语料库：采用第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社会互动、对训练数据进行支架式排序

Result: 预期这种训练语料库重构将实现从第一个训练标记开始的早期价值观承诺，使知识、技能和价值观内在难以分离

Conclusion: 在大型语言模型能力开始超越人类任务的生态系统中，这种从模型训练转向模型培养的范式转变是至关重要的需求

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

Conclusion: 双层监控框架能够有效应对智能AI系统在运行期间的基本可靠性挑战，为高风险领域的应用提供了可行的可靠性保障方案。

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

TL;DR: 提出了MedFuse框架，通过乘法融合模块处理不规则临床时间序列数据，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床时间序列数据具有不规则性、异步采样、缺失值和异质特征动态等特点。现有嵌入策略通常通过加法操作结合特征身份和值嵌入，限制了捕捉值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse（乘法嵌入融合）模块，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入，保留特征特定信息的同时建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集（涵盖重症和慢性护理）上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上持续优于最先进的基线方法。学习表示的分析进一步证明乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse为建模不规则临床时间序列提供了一个可泛化的方法，乘法融合机制有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

Conclusion: HyperD通过解耦周期性和残差分量，有效解决了交通预测中的复杂时空依赖和多尺度模式问题，为智能交通系统提供了可靠的预测解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Method: 引入基于LLM的智能体框架，使用自然语言推理来提出、优化和验证候选证书，集成LLM驱动的模板发现与SMT验证，支持屏障-控制器协同合成。

Result: 在BarrierBench基准测试中，该框架在生成有效证书方面达到超过90%的成功率，展示了检索增强生成和智能体协调策略在提高可靠性和性能方面的效用。

Conclusion: 通过发布BarrierBench基准和相应工具链，旨在建立一个社区测试平台，推动语言推理与动态系统形式验证的整合。

Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.
  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench

We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Motivation: 在高维领域进行科学发现需要访问学习表示中的信息，现有方法在分离条件信息和残差表示方面存在局限。

Method: 基于潜在流匹配和分类器自由引导，显式分离条件信息和残差表示来解耦潜在子空间。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析、控制和重用潜在表示提供了简单而强大的机制，为使用生成模型进行科学探索开辟了途径。

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行进行功能评估。基准测试涵盖针法分类、指令基础、自然语言到DSL翻译和图像到DSL翻译等任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，随着评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性，模型性能急剧下降，暴露了在长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成方面的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，突显了在真实创造性领域中表面理解与可执行精度之间的差距，代码已开源。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

*Adam Tauman Kalai,Yael Tauman Kalai,Or Zamir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多模型聚合的AI安全方法，通过共识采样算法从k个模型中选择最安全的s个子集，在模型间达成足够共识时输出结果，否则弃权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法主要依赖检查模型输出或激活状态，但某些风险无法通过检查单独检测，需要一种架构无关的补充方法。

Method: 使用共识采样算法，利用模型计算输出概率的能力，当足够多的安全模型达成共识时输出结果，否则弃权。算法受Vyas等人的可证明版权保护算法启发。

Result: 该方法能够实现与k个模型中最安全的s个模型平均风险相当的安全性，并在模型间共识不足时通过弃权避免风险。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种新的模型无关的AI安全途径，通过放大集合中未知安全子集的安全保证来创建单个可靠模型。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

TL;DR: 本文从科学和系统角度阐述了物理人工智能的基本原理，旨在为智能系统的物理体现、感知、行动、学习和情境敏感性建立统一的理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI依赖符号处理和数据驱动模型，而物理AI将智能理解为身体、环境和经验之间真实交互的涌现现象，需要建立新的理论基础。

Method: 提出了六个基本原理：具身化、感官感知、运动行动、学习、自主性和情境敏感性，这些原理构成一个封闭的控制循环，能量、信息、控制和情境在其中持续交互。

Result: 构建了一个理论模型，将智能理解为物理具身过程，学习被重新定义为智能体与环境之间结构耦合的变化，而非参数调整。

Conclusion: 物理AI代表了从抽象计算到具身体验的范式转变，智能源于物理经验而非数据库，六个基本原理在真实系统中相互协作形成完整的智能行为。

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

Conclusion: RPO和RPG为合作和一般和设置中的对抗优化提供了有效的解决方案，避免了自我破坏问题，实现了强大的性能表现。

Abstract: Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents' policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

Motivation: 贪婪搜索方法如GBFS和EHC在面临启发式局部最小值或平台等UHR时表现不佳，需要有效的逃离机制。

Method: 推导了BrFS和RRW逃离UHR的期望运行时间理论模型，并开发了使用RRW的EHC变体EHC-RRW，在PDDL规划基准上进行了实验比较。

Result: 理论分析确定了RRW比BrFS更快的条件，实验显示EHC-RRW在EHC有效的场景下具有更强的期望运行时间保证。

Conclusion: 重启随机游走是逃离无信息启发式区域的有效方法，EHC-RRW在理论上和实践中都表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Greedy search methods like Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Enforced Hill-Climbing (EHC) often struggle when faced with Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs) like heuristic local minima or plateaus. In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs.

Method: 基于概率质量函数及其汇总统计量构建计量学概念不确定性评估框架，并在气候观测和医疗诊断两个应用场景中验证。

Result: 开发了一个适用于机器学习分类模型的名义属性不确定性评估框架，能够扩展GUM以涵盖名义属性的不确定性评估。

Conclusion: 该框架使GUM能够扩展到名义属性的不确定性评估，从而使两者都适用于机器学习分类模型。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) classification models are increasingly being used in a wide range of applications where it is important that predictions are accompanied by uncertainties, including in climate and earth observation, medical diagnosis and bioaerosol monitoring. The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for nominal properties. This framework is based on probability mass functions and summary statistics thereof, and it is applicable to ML classification. We also illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis. Our framework would enable an extension of the GUM to uncertainty for nominal properties, which would make both applicable to ML classification models.

Method: 开发了TabPFN-2.5模型，支持5万数据点和2千特征，相比前代提升20倍数据容量；引入蒸馏引擎将模型转换为紧凑的MLP或树集成。

Result: 在TabArena基准中显著优于调优的树模型，匹配AutoGluon 1.4的准确率；对小中型分类数据集有100%胜率，对大型数据集有87%胜率；蒸馏后保持大部分准确率同时大幅降低延迟。

Conclusion: TabPFN-2.5成为表格AI领域的领先方法，通过蒸馏技术实现生产就绪部署，将增强现有TabPFN生态系统的应用性能。

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

Abstract: The bias-variance decomposition is a central result in statistics and machine learning, but is typically presented only for the squared error. We present a generalization of the bias-variance decomposition where the prediction error is a Bregman divergence, which is relevant to maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families. While the result is already known, there was not previously a clear, standalone derivation, so we provide one for pedagogical purposes. A version of this note previously appeared on the author's personal website without context. Here we provide additional discussion and references to the relevant prior literature.

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

Conclusion: CSTs提供了一种稳定、表达性强且无需训练的协方差分析方法，在低样本量情况下优于PCA，性能与需要训练的方法相当。

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

Conclusion: 推理时FK控制将基于扩散的蛋白质设计推广到任意、不可微分和奖励不可知的目标，为引导分子生成提供了一个统一且模型无关的框架。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

TL;DR: CGAR是一种新的递归推理模型训练方法，通过渐进深度课程学习和分层监督加权，在保持性能的同时显著降低训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统递归推理模型训练成本高昂（约36 GPU小时/数据集），限制了其广泛应用和研究。

Method: 提出CGAR方法，包含两个核心组件：渐进深度课程（动态调整递归深度）和分层监督加权（对监督步骤应用指数衰减重要性）。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上，CGAR实现1.71倍训练加速（42%成本降低），仅损失0.63%准确率；推理效率提升，100%停止准确率和11%更少推理步骤。

Conclusion: 通过架构深度的原则性课程学习，可以在有限硬件上高效训练递归推理模型。

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Motivation: 探索神经网络的理论优势是AI时代最具挑战性的问题之一。受Le Cam等价性启发，作者希望通过过参数化序列模型简化自适应特征程序训练动态的分析。

Method: 引入特征误差度量(FEM)来表征学习特征的质量，分析线性回归、单/多索引模型等具体自适应特征模型在训练过程中FEM的变化。

Result: 研究表明，在多个自适应特征模型的训练过程中，特征误差度量(FEM)是递减的，这表明学习到的特征质量在不断提升。

Conclusion: 这些结果为自适应特征程序的成功提供了理论支持，暗示了该程序在分析神经网络特征学习特性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

*Rui Zhu,Yuexing Peng,George C. Alexandropoulos,Wenbo Wang,Wei Xiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出PhyKAN方法，将传统的矩量法(MoM)中的静态RWG基函数推广为可学习的自适应基函数族，通过物理信息Kolmogorov-Arnold网络实现电磁建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统矩量法受限于静态几何定义的基函数(如RWG基)，无法自适应学习最优基函数表示。

Method: 提出PhyKAN方法，将RWG基重新解释为Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的静态实现，构建包含局部KAN分支和嵌入格林函数先验的全局分支的物理信息网络。

Result: 在典型几何形状上，PhyKAN实现了低于0.01的重构误差和无监督雷达散射截面预测精度。

Conclusion: PhyKAN在经典求解器和现代神经网络模型之间建立了可解释、物理一致的桥梁，为电磁建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种二阶确定性actor-critic强化学习框架，利用性能函数的曲率信息来加速收敛


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展经典确定性策略梯度方法，利用性能函数的Hessian矩阵信息来改进收敛速度

Method: 基于兼容函数逼近概念引入二次critic，同时保持真实策略梯度并逼近性能Hessian；开发最小二乘时序差分学习方案估计参数；使用准牛顿actor更新

Result: 数值实验表明该方法比标准确定性actor-critic基线实现了更好的收敛性和性能

Conclusion: 提出的二阶框架能够有效利用曲率信息，在可微策略类中实现更快的收敛

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

*David Sanchez,Holly Lopez,Michelle Buraczyk,Anantaa Kotal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAIRPLAI是一个将人类监督集成到机器学习系统中的实用框架，通过构建隐私-公平边界、支持交互式利益相关者输入和嵌入差分隐私审计循环，在保持强隐私保护的同时减少公平性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在医疗、金融、招聘等关键领域的应用，仅关注准确性已不足够，模型还需要保证公平性、隐私保护和问责制。然而，这些目标之间存在冲突：差分隐私可能加剧不公平，公平性干预需要敏感数据但受隐私限制，自动化流程忽略了公平性本质上是一种人类和情境判断。

Method: FAIRPLAI框架包含三个核心机制：(1)构建隐私-公平边界，使准确性、隐私保证和群体结果之间的权衡透明化；(2)支持交互式利益相关者输入，让决策者根据领域需求选择公平标准和操作点；(3)嵌入差分隐私审计循环，使人类能够审查解释和边缘案例而不损害个体数据安全。

Result: 在基准数据集上的应用表明，FAIRPLAI在保持强隐私保护的同时，相对于自动化基线方法持续减少了公平性差距。更重要的是，它为从业者提供了一个简单、可解释的过程来管理准确性、隐私和公平性之间的竞争需求。

Conclusion: 通过在关键位置嵌入人类判断，FAIRPLAI为构建在实践中有效、负责任且值得信赖的机器学习系统提供了一条可行路径，特别适用于具有社会影响力的应用场景。

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Motivation: 城市拥堵导致车辆移动效率低下，加剧温室气体排放和城市空气污染。宏观排放基本图(eMFD)能捕捉网络层面排放与聚合交通变量之间的有序关系，但由于历史数据限制，经验推导的eMFD模型较为稀疏。

Method: 利用探测车辆获取的大规模细粒度交通和排放数据，首次在美国城市大规模应用机器学习方法预测网络范围的排放率与交通关系。

Result: 开发了数据驱动的eMFD模型，深入理解其对网络、基础设施、土地利用和车辆特征的位置依赖性。

Conclusion: 该分析框架和洞察使交通管理部门能够测量给定出行需求下城市交通的碳排放，并优化特定位置的交通管理和规划决策，以减轻网络范围的排放。

Abstract: Urban congestions cause inefficient movement of vehicles and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高，而现有数据驱动方法存在误差累积和物理一致性不足的问题，特别是在多物理场和复杂几何中。

Method: 通过将PDE动力学（如对流、粘性、扩散）嵌入到不同的消息函数中，重新设计图神经网络架构，并采用分层架构捕获多尺度特征，在损失函数中加入物理正则化。

Conclusion: PEGNet通过物理嵌入的消息传递机制，有效解决了数据驱动方法中的物理一致性问题，为复杂物理现象的模拟提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

Abstract: Fairness in AI-driven stress detection is critical for equitable mental healthcare, yet existing models frequently exhibit gender bias, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. To address this, we propose FairM2S, a fairness-aware meta-learning framework for stress detection leveraging audio-visual data. FairM2S integrates Equalized Odds constraints during both meta-training and adaptation phases, employing adversarial gradient masking and fairness-constrained meta-updates to effectively mitigate bias. Evaluated against five state-of-the-art baselines, FairM2S achieves 78.1% accuracy while reducing the Equal Opportunity to 0.06, demonstrating substantial fairness gains. We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI. We release our dataset and FairM2S publicly with this paper.

TL;DR: 提出了LLM-ABS框架来研究大语言模型代理在独裁者游戏中的行为，发现代理通常表现出公平偏好，且系统提示对行为有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了系统提示对LLM代理行为的影响，且结果对提示的微小变化很敏感，需要建立更稳健的行为研究基线。

Method: 提出LLM-ABS框架：探索不同系统提示的影响、使用中性提示变体获取更可靠的代理偏好、分析语言特征理解行为推理。

Result: 代理通常表现出强烈的公平偏好，系统提示对行为有显著影响，不同模型以不同方式表达响应。

Conclusion: 虽然提示敏感性仍是挑战，但LLM-ABS框架为LLM代理行为研究提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Motivation: 研究图粗化问题，旨在在保持图结构关键特征的同时减少图的规模，这在图分析和机器学习中具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 基于Gromov-Wasserstein几何的图粗化方法能够有效减少图规模同时保持结构特征，为图分析提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

TL;DR: BayesQ是一个基于贝叶斯后验期望损失优化的后训练量化框架，通过高斯后验拟合、白化处理、码本设计和混合精度分配，在3.0/3.5/4.0比特权重下显著提升ResNet-50和BERT-base的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练量化方法未充分考虑权重不确定性，BayesQ首次将量化问题重新定义为后验期望损失最小化问题，以更准确地建模量化风险。

Method: 1) 拟合权重的高斯后验分布；2) 基于后验协方差进行白化处理；3) 设计最小化后验期望失真的码本；4) 使用贪心背包算法分配混合精度；5) 可选校准蒸馏对齐量化模型与后验预测教师。

Result: 在3.0/3.5/4.0比特权重下，相比GPTQ等强基线：ResNet-50在ImageNet上提升+1.5/+0.7/+0.3 top-1百分点；BERT-base在GLUE上提升+1.1/+0.4/+0.2 GLUE分数，预处理成本与GPTQ相当。

Conclusion: BayesQ成功将低比特量化重新定义为不确定性感知的风险最小化问题，提供了一个实用且高效的后训练量化解决方案。

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

Conclusion: LyapInf方法提供了一种有效的黑盒稳定性分析方法，能够仅从轨迹数据推断Lyapunov函数并估计稳定性区域，在航空航天等实际应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Motivation: 现有的差分隐私随机梯度下降方法通常只解决噪声或偏差中的一个问题，减少DP噪声会加剧裁剪偏差，反之亦然，需要一种能同时缓解两者的方法。

Method: DP-PMLF结合逐样本动量在裁剪前平滑梯度估计以减少采样方差，并使用后处理低通滤波器衰减高频DP噪声而不消耗额外隐私预算。

Result: 理论分析显示在严格DP保证下具有改进的收敛率，实证评估表明相比现有DPSGD变体显著提升了隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: DP-PMLF通过同时减轻DP噪声和裁剪偏差，为差分隐私深度学习提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

*Casper L. Christensen,Logan Riggs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将随机参数分解（SPD）扩展到Transformer模型，提出适用于序列数据的因果重要性函数和新损失函数，在玩具模型和GPT-2-small中成功定位可解释的概念组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在玩具模型上成功应用，但尚未扩展到真实模型。本文旨在弥合这一差距，将SPD方法扩展到现代Transformer模型。

Method: 扩展随机参数分解（SPD）到Transformer模型，提出更新的因果重要性函数（适用于序列数据）和新的损失函数。

Result: 成功分解玩具归纳头模型并恢复预期的2步电路；在GPT-2-small中成功定位对应可解释概念（如"高尔夫"、"篮球"）的子组件。

Conclusion: 这是将SPD扩展到现代模型的第一步，表明该方法可用于发现可解释的参数空间机制。

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

TL;DR: ForeSWE是一个新的概率时空预测模型，结合深度学习和经典概率技术，用于预测雪水当量(SWE)，提供预测不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SWE预测对水资源管理决策至关重要，但传统方法未能充分利用时空相关性，也不提供不确定性估计。

Method: 结合注意力机制整合时空特征和交互，以及高斯过程模块提供预测不确定性的原则性量化。

Result: 在美国西部512个SNOTEL站点数据上的评估显示，相比现有方法在预测精度和预测区间方面都有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该模型为水资源管理社区提供了部署和反馈平台，突出了不同方法在不确定性估计方面的有效性。

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

TL;DR: EEG-X是一个设备无关且抗噪声的脑电图基础模型，通过位置通道嵌入和噪声感知掩码重建策略，解决了EEG分析中的设备差异和低信噪比问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG分析中的两个关键挑战：(1)不同记录设备和配置导致的数据集变异性，(2)EEG的低信噪比，其中脑信号常被伪迹和非脑源淹没。

Method: 引入位置通道嵌入编码空间信息；采用噪声感知掩码和重建策略（在原始和潜在空间）；使用字典启发的卷积变换层投影到结构化特征空间；训练重建去噪信号而非原始噪声信号。

Result: 在不同设备收集的数据集上，EEG-X在多个下游EEG任务中优于最先进方法，在电极布局不同的跨域设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: EEG-X通过创新的通道嵌入和噪声处理策略，成功建立了设备无关且抗噪声的EEG基础模型，在跨域任务中展现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts. The models and code are available at: https://github.com/Emotiv/EEG-X

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Transformer编码器和1D CNN聚合器的两阶段架构，通过融入临床元数据和专家事件标注等上下文信息，显著提升了睡眠分期准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动睡眠分期劳动密集且存在评分者间变异性，现有深度学习模型大多仅依赖原始PSG信号，忽略了人类专家使用的上下文线索。

Method: 使用两阶段架构：Transformer-based每时段编码器 + 1D CNN聚合器，系统研究融入临床元数据（年龄、性别、BMI）和专家事件标注（呼吸暂停、血氧饱和度下降、觉醒、周期性呼吸）的效果。

Result: 在SHHS队列（n=8,357）上，相比仅使用PSG的基线（macro-F1 0.7745，micro-F1 0.8774），最终模型达到macro-F1 0.8031和micro-F1 0.9051，事件标注贡献最大增益。特征融合优于多任务替代方案。

Conclusion: 用临床有意义特征增强学习表示可提高性能和可解释性，无需修改PSG导联或额外传感器，为实现上下文感知、专家对齐的睡眠分期系统提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

TL;DR: 提出了光谱可预测性指标Ω，用于快速选择时间序列预测模型。当Ω高时，大型时间序列基础模型表现更好；当Ω低时，轻量级模型足够。该指标计算快速，可降低验证成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列预测模型选择的两难困境：全面验证多个模型计算成本高，但选择错误模型会导致性能不佳。需要一种快速有效的模型选择方法。

Method: 使用光谱可预测性Ω这一简单信号处理指标来分层模型性能。在四个不同领域进行控制实验，并在GIFT-Eval基准的51个模型和28个数据集上扩展分析。

Result: 发现当Ω高时，大型时间序列基础模型系统性地优于轻量级任务训练基线；当Ω下降时，其优势消失。Ω计算仅需每数据集几秒钟。

Conclusion: Ω可预测地分层模型性能，提供实用的初步筛选工具，降低验证成本，同时强调需要开发在真正困难（低Ω）问题上表现出色的模型。

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Result: 在PEMS-BAY和METR-LA数据集上的评估表明，Weaver在保持竞争性性能的同时训练效率更高。

Conclusion: Weaver模型通过创新的注意力分解和负边建模方法，在交通网络时空预测任务中实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

Conclusion: DIVO在离线强化学习中实现了保守性与可探索性之间的关键平衡，通过价值条件优化有效提升了策略性能。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.

Conclusion: 该方法通过准确重构TAC值，有效识别和移除后门，在各种实验设置下都表现出色，为后门防御提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的条件变分自编码器(CVAE)方法，通过将高斯解码器的方差作为可学习参数，并使用归一化流估计潜在空间的条件分布，从而解决传统VAE生成图像模糊和多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型已成为新的SOTA，但传统生成模型仍有改进空间。传统CVAE假设潜在空间的条件分布等于先验分布，这与实际情况不符，导致生成质量受限。

Method: 1. 将高斯解码器的方差作为可学习参数进行训练；2. 使用归一化流来估计给定标签时潜在空间的条件分布，而不是简单假设其等于先验分布。

Result: 相比现有方法，该方法将FID降低了5%，对数似然提高了7.7%，表明在图像生成质量上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过改进CVAE的条件分布建模方法，可以有效提升传统生成模型的性能，证明即使在扩散模型时代，传统方法仍有改进潜力。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

Result: 在常识推理基准测试中，使用Qwen1.5-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE的实验表明，Bayesian-MoE在预期校准误差和负对数似然方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Bayesian-MoE框架能够为可靠的下游决策提供有效的后验不确定性估计，证实了其在提升模型校准性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏混合专家模型依赖辅助损失和额外可训练参数来促进专家多样性，导致目标不对齐和模型复杂度增加。Sinkhorn方法训练开销大。

Method: 将token到专家分配建模为最优传输问题，直接从传输映射推导门控分数，提出选择性Sinkhorn路由机制。

Result: 在语言建模和图像分类任务中，SSR实现了更快的训练速度、更高的准确性和对输入损坏更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SSR方法有效提升了稀疏混合专家模型的性能，无需辅助平衡损失，实现了更高效的专家路由。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has gained prominence as a scalable and computationally efficient architecture, enabling significant growth in model capacity without incurring additional inference costs. However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.

Motivation: 传统RCT成本高、耗时长，无法跟上AI模型快速迭代的速度，需要更高效的验证方法。

Method: BRIDGE设计复用已完成试验中AI模型预测一致的参与者数据，减少新试验的入组需求，并提供检查清单确保因果推断有效性。

Conclusion: BRIDGE设计使I级证据生成对每个模型迭代都可行，加速AI向常规医疗的转化。

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Motivation: 解决标准内在方法在高维非欧几里得流形上聚类的计算挑战，提供更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用p-Fréchet映射F^p将流形数据嵌入到低维欧几里得空间，然后应用k-means等标准欧几里得聚类技术。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了流形数据聚类的计算效率，在现有替代方法难以处理的情况下仍能有效工作。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Conclusion: FLAD为未来协作式自动驾驶模型训练和知识共享开辟了新途径，解决了实际部署中的资源限制和容错训练等挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据分布差异（如协变量偏移和语义偏移）严重影响可靠性的问题，现有不变学习方法在准确捕捉不变特征和直接构建因果表示方面存在局限。

Method: 提出FedSDWC方法，整合不变和可变特征，通过建模它们之间的弱因果影响来推断因果语义表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了FedSDWC在处理协变量和语义偏移方面的优越性能，在CIFAR-10上平均比次优基线FedICON提升3.04%，在CIFAR-100上提升8.11%。

Conclusion: FedSDWC通过因果推理方法有效增强了联邦学习的泛化能力，理论上推导了特定条件下的泛化误差界，并首次建立了与客户端先验分布的关系。

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

TL;DR: 本文提出GeoGNN，一种在文本属性图上进行流形感知聚合的方法，通过测地线聚合在单位球面上保持语义流形结构，解决传统线性聚合导致的语义漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代预训练语言模型的表示空间具有高度非线性和几何结构，文本嵌入位于弯曲的语义流形上。传统的线性聚合在这种流形上会扭曲几何结构，导致语义漂移，使聚合表示偏离内在流形，丧失语义保真度和表达能力。

Conclusion: 流形感知聚合在文本属性图学习中具有重要意义，GeoGNN为解决语义漂移问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.

Conclusion: 该方法为更广泛应用中可证明高效的IPE提供了潜力，展示了反馈增强方法在稀疏反馈环境下的有效性。

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为在PINNs中保证任何积分量的守恒提供了一个通用框架，前提是存在可处理的解。

Abstract: We propose a novel projection method that guarantees the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

Conclusion: 通过学习可定制的类别关系距离度量，显著提升了聚类算法的适应性和准确性，特别适用于包含分类和数值属性的混合数据集。

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的重排序网络能有效减少填充元素，提升LU分解效率，为稀疏矩阵重排序提供了新的优化方法。

Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: FedPM通过预条件混合有效缓解了局部预条件器漂移问题，充分发挥了二阶优化的潜力

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了RLHF/DPO流程中的基本脆弱性，并提供了评估其对抗低成本投毒攻击鲁棒性的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Class imbalance has been extensively studied in single-view scenarios; however, addressing this challenge in multi-view contexts remains an open problem, with even scarcer research focusing on trustworthy solutions. In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving superior performance. The code is released at https://github.com/cncq-tang/TMLC.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效估计高斯过程回归的全局和局部不确定性边界，无需特定输入位置信息，在理论和实验层面均表现出优越性。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Interlat提出了一种基于LLM隐藏状态的智能体间潜在空间通信范式，通过直接传输潜在表示而非离散token来提升协作问题解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言作为LLM智能体通信媒介存在根本限制，将丰富的内部潜在状态下采样为离散token会限制信息传输的深度和细微差别，从而阻碍协作问题解决。

Method: 利用LLM的最后一个隐藏状态作为心智表示进行直接传输（潜在通信），并通过额外的压缩过程在潜在空间中进行推理来进一步压缩潜在通信。

Result: 实验表明Interlat优于微调的思维链提示和单智能体基线，促进了更多探索行为并实现了潜在信息的真正利用。进一步压缩不仅显著加速推理，还通过高效的信息保留机制保持了竞争力。

Conclusion: 这项工作作为完全潜在空间智能体间通信的可行性研究，结果突显了其潜力，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

*Shira Lifshitz,Ofir Lindenbaum,Gal Mishne,Ron Meir,Hadas Benisty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GroupFS是一个端到端的无监督特征选择框架，能够联合发现潜在特征组并从中选择最具信息量的组，无需预定义分组或标签监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督特征选择方法通常单独评估特征，但信息信号往往来自相关特征组。虽然有些方法尝试捕捉组结构，但依赖预定义分区或标签监督，限制了适用性。

Method: GroupFS通过强制特征图和样本图的拉普拉斯平滑性，并应用组稀疏正则化器来学习紧凑的结构化表示，联合发现特征组并选择信息量最大的组。

Result: 在九个基准数据集（图像、表格数据和生物数据集）上，GroupFS在聚类任务中始终优于最先进的无监督特征选择方法，并选择出与有意义模式对齐的特征组。

Conclusion: GroupFS能够有效发现和选择相关特征组，在无监督特征选择任务中表现出色，选择的特征组与有意义的模式一致。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Hessian匹配的紧凑记忆构建方法，用于逻辑回归模型的持续学习，显著优于经验回放方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习仍无法达到批量训练的性能，需要构建紧凑记忆来避免灾难性遗忘，但目前尚无明确解决方案，即使是浅层神经网络。

Method: 将最优记忆搜索问题表述为Hessian匹配，并提出概率PCA方法来估计最优记忆。

Result: 在Split-ImageNet上，使用0.3%数据大小的记忆可获得60%准确率（经验回放为30%），使用2%记忆可达到74%准确率，接近批量训练的77.6%。

Conclusion: 为构建紧凑记忆开辟了新方向，未来也可用于深度持续学习。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, continual learning still does not match the performance of batch training. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task. Our work opens a new direction for building compact memory that can also be useful in the future for continual deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFDT通过两级数据过滤、优势条件令牌和Q引导正则化，解决了决策变换器在跨域适应中的轨迹片段拼接问题，提升了策略性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨域策略适应方法通常使用单一过滤标准选择源轨迹片段进行拼接，但存在状态结构错位、RTG不可比和动作跳跃等问题，导致拼接性差，影响DT的推理能力。

Method: 提出DFDT框架：1）使用MMD不匹配和OT偏差进行两级数据过滤，融合稀缺目标数据和可信源片段；2）用优势条件令牌替换RTG令牌；3）应用Q引导正则化抑制连接点值和动作跳跃。

Result: 在D4RL风格控制任务的重力、运动学和形态学变化中，DFDT相比强离线RL和序列模型基线，提高了回报和稳定性，并通过令牌拼接和序列语义稳定性分析验证了这些收益。

Conclusion: DFDT通过恢复轨迹片段的拼接性，有效解决了决策变换器在跨域适应中的挑战，理论分析表明状态值和策略性能差距与MMD不匹配和OT偏差测量相关，且随着这两个测量的缩小而收紧。

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

### [210] [FSampler: Training Free Acceleration of Diffusion Sampling via Epsilon Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09180)
*Michael A. Vladimir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSampler是一种无需训练、采样器无关的执行层，通过减少函数评估次数来加速扩散采样。它使用历史去噪信号进行外推预测，在保持采样器更新规则不变的情况下跳过部分模型调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型采样过程中需要大量函数评估，计算成本高昂。FSampler旨在减少模型调用次数，从而加速采样过程，同时保持高保真度。

Method: 维护近期去噪信号历史，使用有限差分预测器（二阶、三阶或四阶）外推下一个epsilon。在选定步骤用预测值替代模型调用，通过验证机制、学习稳定器和保护窗口确保稳定性。

Result: 在FLUX.1 dev、Qwen Image和Wan 2.2上，FSampler减少时间8-22%，模型调用15-25%（SSIM 0.95-0.99）。激进模式下可减少45-50%模型调用（SSIM 0.73-0.74）。

Conclusion: FSampler提供了一种有效的扩散采样加速方法，兼容多种采样器，在不改变采样器公式的情况下显著减少计算开销。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PBT系列算法中，超参数更新间隔是一个重要的元超参数，会显著影响性能，但目前没有高效设置其值的方法或直觉。

Method: IPBT通过任务无关的权重信息重用重启机制，并使用时变贝叶斯优化重新初始化超参数，自动调整超参数更新间隔。

Result: 在8个图像分类和强化学习任务上的评估表明，IPBT平均匹配或优于5种先前PBT变体和其他HPO算法，且无需增加预算或修改其超参数。

Conclusion: IPBT是一种有效的PBT变体，能自动优化关键元超参数，在各种任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) can lift the burden of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) of neural networks. HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs. The source code is available at https://github.com/AwesomeLemon/IPBT.

Motivation: 现有AI文本检测数据集存在质量问题，特别是DetectRL数据集中98.5%的Claude-LLM数据包含简单生成模式，这些模式可能被检测器用作捷径，导致容易受到欺骗攻击。

Method: 对DetectRL数据集进行多种清洗操作，移除包含简单AI生成模式的数据，如LLM的引导性语句和任务拒绝响应。

Result: 实验表明数据清洗使得直接攻击检测器变得更加困难，提高了检测器的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 数据清洗是提高AI文本检测器安全性的有效方法，作者公开了重新处理后的数据集供研究使用。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的MILP求解方法存在两个层面的不对齐问题：学习目标层面，二元交叉熵损失独立处理变量，忽略了相对优先级；模型架构层面，标准GNN消息传递平滑了变量表示，错过了约束内变量的竞争关系。

Method: 提出CoCo-MILP框架，包含两个核心组件：1）变量间对比损失，最大化被赋值为1和0的变量嵌入之间的边界；2）约束内竞争GNN层，学习区分约束内竞争变量的表示，捕捉其互斥性。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoCo-MILP显著优于现有的基于学习的方法，与传统求解器相比，解决方案差距减少了高达68.12%。

Conclusion: CoCo-MILP通过显式建模变量间的对比和约束内的竞争关系，为MILP求解提供了更有效的学习框架，在加速大规模组合优化问题求解方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Conclusion: SCMax框架通过自监督共识最大化成功实现了完全无参数聚类，能够自动确定最优聚类数量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

Conclusion: 基于模型的强化学习方法能够有效学习分支定界过程中的分支策略，在MILP求解中取得优于传统RL方法的性能。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&B). A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Conclusion: AdaCuRL通过自适应课程强化学习有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为增强大语言模型的推理能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.

TL;DR: 本文研究了预测编码框架中低维内部表征形成的条件，发现网络深度和预测时间跨度共同决定了是否能恢复环境的潜在结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测编码框架能形成反映环境潜在结构的低维内部表征，但这类表征在什么条件下出现尚不清楚。

Method: 使用受先前工作启发的抽象设置，通过理论和实证分析研究预测时间跨度和网络深度对预测编码任务解决方案的影响，并将这些见解扩展到非线性网络和复杂数据集。

Result: 足够深的网络配合多步预测时间跨度能一致地恢复潜在结构，这一现象可通过普通最小二乘估计器结构和学习动态中的偏差来解释。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解预测编码何时以及为何诱导结构化表征提供了原则性理解，弥合了经验观察与理论基础之间的差距。

Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护隐私，但仍易受攻击影响模型效用或公平性。现有研究主要关注单一目标攻击，同时破坏效用和公平性的攻击策略尚未充分探索

Method: 提出双重攻击DFA（包括同步S-DFA和分离Sp-DFA），并开发GuardFed防御框架，通过维护公平感知参考模型和计算双重信任分数来选择性聚合客户端更新

Result: 实验表明现有鲁棒联邦学习防御无法有效抵抗DFA攻击，而GuardFed在各种非IID和对抗条件下能持续保持准确性和公平性，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: DFA攻击揭示了联邦学习的新安全威胁，GuardFed提供了一种有效的防御机制，为构建更安全的联邦学习系统提供了重要保障

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RENTT的算法，能够将神经网络精确转换为等价的决策树表示，解决了现有可解释AI方法缺乏忠实性的问题，并提供了计算真实特征重要性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络的黑盒特性阻碍了其广泛应用，现有可解释AI方法往往缺乏忠实性，无法准确反映神经网络的决策逻辑。现有的决策树转换方法在处理大型神经网络时缺乏精确性、可扩展性或可解释性。

Method: 提出了RENTT算法，通过严格的数学证明，能够将卷积神经网络、循环神经网络、非ReLU激活函数和偏置项等复杂神经网络精确转换为等价的多元决策树表示，并在运行时和内存使用上保持高效。

Result: RENTT算法在计算效率和可扩展性方面表现优异，相比传统的近似方法（如LIME和SHAP），只有RENTT能够揭示真实的解释。详细的数值实验验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: RENTT提供了一种精确、高效的方法来理解神经网络的决策过程，通过转换为决策树表示，能够计算全局、区域和局部层面的真实特征重要性，为神经网络的可解释性提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP. All code is available at https://github.com/HelenaM23/RENTT .

Conclusion: TCNN通过结合张量神经网络和电路模型的优势，在保持低复杂度的同时实现了优异的泛化能力和鲁棒性，消融研究验证了激活操作、并行架构和信息融合层的有效性。

Abstract: It is challenging to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications. Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\%-3\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注参数和优化器状态的内存减少，但激活内存（特别是来自前馈网络FFN）已成为关键瓶颈，尤其是在实现FlashAttention后。FFN激活是激活内存开销的主要来源。

Method: 引入MoC架构，利用SwiGLU的原生门控机制为每个token选择性激活Top-K最相关通道，在预训练期间显著减少激活内存，并通过部分权重加载到GPU SRAM来提高推理效率。

Result: 大量实验验证MoC在保持竞争性模型性能的同时，提供了显著的内存节省和吞吐量增益。

Conclusion: MoC是一种有效的FFN架构创新，能够显著减少LLM的激活内存开销，同时维持模型性能，为大规模语言模型的高效训练和推理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

Motivation: 复杂的黑盒AI模型需要解释其决策，但特征归因方法领域缺乏正式的问题定义，许多现有方法不满足基于数据分布的要求。

Method: 提出了分布特征归因解释（DFAX），这是一种模型无关的特征归因方法，直接基于给定数据集表示的概率分布来解释分类器预测。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，DFAX比现有最先进的基准方法更有效和高效。

Conclusion: DFAX填补了特征归因领域的正式定义空白，提供了一种基于数据分布的有效解释方法，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在数字孪生推荐系统上的实验表明，QWI能够适应潜在状态变化并收敛到最优策略。

Conclusion: MARBLE模型有效处理非平稳环境，QWI算法在MAI准则下能够收敛到最优解，理论结果得到实验验证。

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CREAT的约束强化学习驱动的配置文件污染攻击方法，通过双层次优化框架和多奖励强化学习来平衡攻击效果和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的配置文件污染攻击方法存在两个局限性：过度依赖序列水平影响限制了细粒度的项目转换扰动，以及整体修改导致可检测的分布偏移。

Method: 开发了模式平衡奖励策略，整合模式反转奖励和分布一致性奖励；采用约束组相对强化学习范式，通过动态屏障约束和组共享经验回放实现逐步扰动。

Result: 大量实验证明了CREAT的有效性。

Conclusion: CREAT方法能够实现目标污染，同时保持最小的可检测性。

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

Motivation: 现有的SHAP计算方法在处理大规模数据集时效率较低，特别是在需要背景数据集估计特征分布的Background SHAP计算中，计算复杂度较高。

Method: 为每个消费者构建伪布尔公式，捕捉特征值、决策树集成结构和整个背景数据集，然后利用这种表示在线性时间内计算Background SHAP值。

Conclusion: WOODELF提供了一个高效、可扩展的SHAP计算框架，支持多种博弈论值的计算，能够满足实际应用中大规模SHAP计算的需求。

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法特别是生成模型为恢复PET成像中缺失信息提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDPR和CCPA等隐私法规要求对未经授权的时空图数据进行完全遗忘。由于时空图中节点信息在时空维度上全局扩散，现有遗忘方法无法高效擦除单个节点，成本接近完全重新训练。

Method: 提出CallosumNet框架，包含两个核心技术：1) 增强子图构建(ESC)，基于生物启发虚拟神经节自适应构建局部子图；2) 全局神经节桥接(GGB)，从局部子图重建全局时空依赖关系。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，CallosumNet仅产生1%-2%的相对MAE损失，显著优于现有最先进方法。消融研究验证了两个技术的有效性。

Conclusion: CallosumNet为时空图数据遗忘提供了一个高效解决方案，能够满足严格隐私法规要求，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

*Jiao Chen,Weihua Li,Jianhua Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PTE（Probing then Editing）的无保留数据遗忘框架，通过探测-编辑过程实现选择性知识遗忘，仅需遗忘数据和原始模型即可完成高效知识编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态工业物联网环境中模型需要选择性遗忘过时或错误知识的问题，避免现有方法依赖保留数据带来的计算负担和隐私合规冲突。

Method: PTE框架包含两个阶段：1）通过梯度上升探测遗忘类别的决策边界邻域，生成编辑指令；2）执行推-拉协同优化，推分支主动拆解目标类决策区域，拉分支通过掩码知识蒸馏锚定保留类知识。

Result: 在CWRU和SCUT-FD等多个通用和工业基准测试中，PTE在遗忘效果和模型效用之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: PTE框架仅使用遗忘数据和原始模型即可实现高效平衡的知识编辑，为工业物联网环境中的模型知识管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

*Philipp Anthes,Dominik Sobania,Franz Rothlauf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSGP使用预训练transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制语义相似性生成子代程序，在符号回归问题上显著优于其他方法，并能通过目标语义距离平衡探索与利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义遗传编程依赖固定语法变换，TSGP旨在学习能产生相似语义的多样化结构变异。

Method: 使用在数百万程序上预训练的transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制目标语义距离SD_t来生成语义相似的子代程序。

Result: 在24个真实世界和合成数据集上，TSGP显著优于标准GP、SLIM_GSGP、深度符号回归和去噪自编码器GP，平均排名1.58，且比SLIM_GSGP产生更紧凑的解。

Conclusion: TSGP能跨维度泛化，SD_t能有效控制语义空间步长：小值实现持续改进但程序较大，大值促进快速收敛和紧凑性，为平衡探索与利用提供机制。

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Conclusion: 在机制可解释性工具中融入对称性结构具有重要价值，能够提升特征发现和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools.

TL;DR: 提出一个集成全局解释和特设特征映射的新框架，用于提高太阳高能粒子事件预测模型的可解释性，帮助理解物理机制而不仅仅是获得预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的SEP预测方法多为黑盒模型，难以解释结果和了解事件背后的物理原因，需要提高模型透明度以支持太阳物理学家的研究。

Method: 集成全局解释和特设特征映射的框架，使用341个SEP事件数据集进行验证，包括244个重要质子事件，涵盖太阳周期22、23和24。

Conclusion: 该框架成功增强了SEP预测模型的透明度，为理解太阳高能粒子事件的物理机制提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否可以直接在评估对齐的嵌入空间中进行规划，而不是训练策略或价值头。

Method: 使用监督对比学习学习评估对齐的嵌入空间，其中结果相似性通过邻近性捕获，单一全局优势向量从输到赢区域定向空间。

Result: 在国际象棋中，SOLIS仅使用浅层搜索和学习的嵌入指导，在受限条件下达到竞争性强度。

Conclusion: 评估对齐的潜在规划为传统动态模型或策略学习提供了轻量级替代方案。

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Conclusion: 基于概率密度的核心集选择方法能够有效提升持续学习的性能，同时保持较高的计算效率，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

TL;DR: AutoSynth是一个无需参考数据集的自动化工作流发现和优化框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和混合奖励机制解决主观任务中的冷启动问题，显著减少人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调需要高质量数据集但人工标注成本高昂，现有自动化方法面临冷启动问题——需要标注数据来建模奖励，这在主观开放式任务中尤其困难。

Method: 将问题重构为蒙特卡洛树搜索，使用无数据集混合奖励引导搜索，包含两个LLM作为评判组件：一个评估样本质量，另一个评估工作流代码和提示质量。

Result: 在主观教育任务中，AutoSynth生成的数据训练的模型显著优于基线（40-51% vs 2-5%），在某些指标上匹配或超越专家工作流，同时将人工工作量从5-7小时减少到30分钟。

Conclusion: AutoSynth解决了数据中心AI中的冷启动问题，为主观LLM任务提供了可扩展、经济高效的方法。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

TL;DR: GenePheno是首个可解释的多标签预测框架，能够直接从基因序列预测基因敲除诱导的表型异常，通过对比多标签学习和生物学一致性正则化来捕捉表型间相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注特定基因变体对有限表型的影响，或依赖人工整理的遗传信息，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。直接从基因序列广泛预测基因敲除诱导的多表型异常仍未被充分探索。

Method: 采用对比多标签学习目标捕捉表型间相关性，结合排他性正则化确保生物学一致性，并引入基因功能瓶颈层提供可解释的功能机制概念。

Conclusion: GenePheno为从基因序列直接预测敲除诱导表型异常提供了有效的可解释框架，推动了假设驱动实验的可扩展性。

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

Conclusion: 数字时域计算方法为Tsetlin机器推理提供了一种高效的解决方案，显著降低了计算开销并提升了性能。

Abstract: Machine learning fits model parameters to approximate input-output mappings, predicting unknown samples. However, these models often require extensive arithmetic computations during inference, increasing latency and power consumption. This paper proposes a digital-time-domain computing approach for Tsetlin machine (TM) inference process to address these challenges. This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput.

Abstract: Designing ligands that are both chemically valid and structurally compatible with protein binding pockets is a key bottleneck in computational drug discovery. Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.

TL;DR: NSL-MT是一种通过将语言约束编码为严重性加权惩罚来教导模型不生成什么内容的训练方法，能显著提升机器翻译性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限平行语料情况下机器翻译模型的训练问题，通过明确惩罚语言无效输出来提升模型质量。

Method: 使用目标语言语法违规的合成生成数据来增强有限平行数据，在损失函数中对这些语言无效输出分配高概率时施加严重性加权惩罚。

Result: 在所有架构上都带来改进：性能良好模型获得3-12% BLEU提升，初始支持不足模型获得56-89%提升；提供5倍数据效率，1000个样本训练效果相当于正常5000个样本训练。

Conclusion: NSL-MT为有限标注平行语料场景提供了一种数据高效的替代训练方法。

Abstract: We introduce Negative Space Learning MT (NSL-MT), a training method that teaches models what not to generate by encoding linguistic constraints as severity-weighted penalties in the loss function. NSL-MT increases limited parallel data with synthetically generated violations of target language grammar, explicitly penalizing the model when it assigns high probability to these linguistically invalid outputs. We demonstrate that NSL-MT delivers improvements across all architectures: 3-12\% BLEU gains for well-performing models and 56-89\% gains for models lacking descent initial support. Furthermore, NSL-MT provides a 5x data efficiency multiplier -- training with 1,000 examples matches or exceeds normal training with 5,000 examples. Thus, NSL-MT provides a data-efficient alternative training method for settings where there is limited annotated parallel corporas.
