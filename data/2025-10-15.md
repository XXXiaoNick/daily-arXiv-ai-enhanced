TL;DR: LLMs在逻辑谜题上表现脆弱，主要依赖记忆而非真正推理。当谜题被轻微修改时，模型性能崩溃，出现'幻影回忆'现象——自信地复述记忆中的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅仅依赖记忆模板。当谜题被扰动时，模型能否重新推理，而不是简单地回忆已知答案。

Method: 引入PHANTOM RECALL基准，包含25个经典逻辑谜题和149个精心设计的扰动版本。评估11个领先LLM，开发自动化逻辑等价判断器、细粒度错误分类法和提示缓解框架。

Result: 在未修改谜题上准确率接近完美，但在扰动谜题上显著低于人类表现。模型表现出幻影回忆和过度阐述两种主要错误模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在语境线索变化时往往无法重新推理，突显了语言流畅性与逻辑理解之间的关键差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear
adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning
underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently
rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When
puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a
striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?
To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general
way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these
things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25
well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve
reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate
eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom
recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious
rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this
issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to
detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error
categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these
categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models
significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom
recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs
often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap
between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

TL;DR: LLMs作为世界模型在数字环境中增强智能体决策，但存在幻觉和静态知识限制。研究提出R-WoM方法，通过检索外部教程知识来提升长期模拟性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs作为世界模型时因幻觉和静态知识导致的长期模拟性能下降问题，提升智能体在数字环境中的决策能力。

Method: 提出检索增强世界模型(R-WoM)，通过从外部教程检索事实性、最新知识来增强LLM的模拟能力，减少幻觉和错误累积。

Result: R-WoM在OSWorld和WebArena基准测试中分别取得25.3%和18.1%的性能提升，在长期模拟中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: LLMs在短期状态预测方面有效，但长期模拟能力有限；R-WoM通过知识检索显著提升了LLMs作为世界模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent
decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and
predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error
exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'
tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,
which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To
systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we
probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward
estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure
planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows
that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify
meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in
full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling
environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we
propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM
simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from
external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial
improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to
baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

### [3] [LLM Knowledge is Brittle: Truthfulness Representations Rely on Superficial Resemblance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11905)
*Patrick Haller,Mark Ibrahim,Polina Kirichenko,Levent Sagun,Samuel J. Bell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM对陈述真实性的内部表示在样本呈现形式偏离预训练数据时会崩溃，表明LLM学习的是浅层、非鲁棒的知识表示，导致基准测试性能脆弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM性能脆弱性是否源于不稳定的内部知识表示，特别是测试在语义保留但表面形式变化的样本上，真实性表示的可分离性如何退化。

Method: 通过对样本应用语义保留的扰动（如拼写错误、重新表述），评估四种LLM家族、五个评估数据集和三种知识探测方法中表示可分离性的退化情况。

Result: 当样本呈现形式与预训练数据相似度降低时，LLM对陈述真实性的内部表示会崩溃，真实性区分能力高度依赖于陈述的确切表面形式。

Conclusion: LLM可能学习的是浅层、非鲁棒的知识表示，这限制了其泛化能力，对真实性探测的实用性提出了根本性挑战，需要进一步研究改进学习知识表示的鲁棒性。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust
knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike
those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM
performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to
trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is
a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this
question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode
statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily
separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of
learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that
have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution
(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving
perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more
OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge
probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement
truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to
those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true
and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this
ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These
findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs
may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only
limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the
utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on
improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

### [4] [LLM Reasoning for Machine Translation: Synthetic Data Generation over Thinking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11919)
*Armel Zebaze,Rachel Bawden,Benoît Sagot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型推理模型在机器翻译任务中生成中间"思考标记"并不能提升翻译性能，但通过模块化翻译策略构建中间标记可以带来改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在机器翻译任务中使用中间思考标记的潜在好处，特别是在不同资源水平的语言对中。

Method: 使用蒸馏思维链方法微调模型，生成详细的逐步翻译解释作为中间标记，并与标准输入输出微调进行比较。

Result: 思维链解释的中间标记未能提升翻译性能，但通过模块化翻译策略构建的中间标记确实带来了改进。

Conclusion: 中间标记在微调中的贡献高度依赖于其中是否包含翻译尝试，使用教师模型精炼目标翻译比蒸馏其思维链解释更有效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of
problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process
prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across
mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation
(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the
generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language
pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that
"thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes
to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of
thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,
fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate
step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,
constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular
translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings
underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning
highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More
broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations
or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT
explanations into "thinking" MT models.

### [5] [Discrepancy Detection at the Data Level: Toward Consistent Multilingual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11928)
*Lorena Calvo-Bartolomé,Valérie Aldana,Karla Cantarero,Alonso Madroñal de Mesa,Jerónimo Arenas-García,Jordan Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MIND框架，一种用户参与的事实检查流程，用于检测多语言问答知识库中的事实和文化差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言问答系统需要确保跨语言的事实一致性，同时考虑主观回答中的文化差异

Method: 用户参与的事实检查流程，通过标注双语问题的事实和文化不一致性来检测差异

Result: 在母婴健康领域的双语问答系统上评估，并在其他领域数据集上测试泛化能力，MIND能可靠识别不一致性

Conclusion: MIND支持开发更具文化意识和事实一致性的问答系统

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency
across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?,
while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We
propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and
cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights
divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in
childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual
QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of
bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We
further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In
all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development
of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

### [6] [TopoAlign: A Framework for Aligning Code to Math via Topological Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11944)
*Yupei Li,Philipp Borchert,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopoAlign框架利用代码库作为数学大语言模型的训练资源，通过将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，并重新组装成结构上与形式数学语句相似的数据，从而提升模型在数学形式化任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学大语言模型在自动形式化任务上表现不佳，主要受限于大规模非正式与形式数学语句配对语料的稀缺。虽然现有模型能够从自然语言生成代码，但代码与形式数学在结构和语法上的差异限制了有效的迁移学习。

Method: 提出TopoAlign框架，将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，然后重新组装这些组件，使其结构上类似于形式数学语句，从而生成结构对齐的代码数据用于训练数学大语言模型，无需额外人工标注。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Math和Herald两个先进模型上评估，TopoAlign显著提升了性能：DeepSeek-Math在BEq@10上提升17.77%，在typecheck@10上提升68.82%；Herald在BEq@10和typecheck@10上分别提升0.12%和1.09%。

Conclusion: TopoAlign框架通过利用广泛可用的代码库作为训练资源，有效提升了数学大语言模型在自动形式化任务上的性能，即使对于专门化模型也有益处，且无需引入新的数学知识或额外人工标注。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4)
mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of
transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation
helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which
enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the
performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale
corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements.
Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language
instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal
mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a
framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources
for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and
dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that
structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code
data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human
annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and
evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign
provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%
on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical
knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10
and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code
data is beneficial even for specialized models.

### [7] [GRAVITY: A Framework for Personalized Text Generation via Profile-Grounded Synthetic Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11952)
*Priyanka Dey,Daniele Rosa,Wenqing Zheng,Daniel Barcklow,Jieyu Zhao,Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAVITY框架通过生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据来减少对人工标注的依赖，整合人口统计、文化和心理框架来指导个性化内容生成，在跨文化评估中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM个性化方法依赖昂贵的人工反馈或交互日志，限制了可扩展性且忽略了更深层的用户属性，需要减少对人工标注的依赖。

Method: 引入GRAVITY框架，整合Hofstede文化维度、Schwartz基本价值观、世界价值观调查和Big Five OCEAN人格特质等框架，生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据对。

Result: 在400名亚马逊用户的图书描述评估中，GRAVITY相比提示条件化、标准微调和朴素合成对生成方法，在跨文化场景中实现超过4%的偏好增益，用户研究显示86%的情况下更受偏好。

Conclusion: 基于场景的合成数据能捕捉更丰富的用户差异，减少对昂贵标注的依赖，生成更具吸引力的用户中心内容，为LLM个性化提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction
logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the
reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with
Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating
synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,
values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,
and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --
GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.
We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to
prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair
generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,
especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over
4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that
GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that
scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce
reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered
content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

*Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu,Bryan Li,Arman Cohan,William Gantt Walden,Eugene Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CRUMQs（不可作弊、真实、不可回答、多跳查询）自动生成流程，用于创建更具挑战性的RAG基准测试，解决现有基准在复杂查询评估上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实RAG系统面临复杂查询时，相关信息可能缺失或不完整，需要能够拒绝不可回答的查询并识别检索和多跳推理的失败。现有基准很少反映真实任务复杂性，限制了发现RAG系统局限性的能力。

Method: 开发了首个自动、难度可控的CRUMQs生成流程，可适应任何语料库和领域。该流程创建不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询。

Result: 在两个流行RAG数据集上创建CRUMQs，实验表明相比现有基准，CRUMQs对RAG系统极具挑战性，作弊分数降低高达81.0%。

Conclusion: CRUMQs生成流程提供了一种简单方法来增强基准难度和真实性，推动开发更强大的RAG系统。

Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which
relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these
settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries
and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this,
existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop
or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected
reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only
simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover
limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first
pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of
un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable,
and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs),
adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over
two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark
experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to
prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve
up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline
offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive
development of more capable RAG systems.

### [9] [Direct Multi-Token Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11958)
*Xuan Luo,Weizhi Wang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出直接多令牌解码（DMTD）方法，通过仅使用后层一次处理多个令牌来加速LLM推理，无需额外参数或验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于预训练LLM中不同层承担不同角色的观察：早期层理解输入上下文，中间层处理任务特定处理，后期层将抽象表示转换为输出令牌。假设一旦表示经过早期和中间层处理，隐藏状态可能包含足够信息来仅使用后期层生成多个令牌。

Method: DMTD方法，在有限数据集上对Qwen3-4B模型进行微调，仅使用后期层一次解码多个令牌，避免重复遍历早期和中间层。

Result: 微调后的DMTD Qwen3-4B模型实现了高达2倍的加速，仅带来轻微性能损失。缩放分析表明性能有望随训练数据集增大而进一步提升。

Conclusion: DMTD是一种有前景的LLM推理加速方法，无需额外参数或验证，通过利用分层处理特性实现高效的多令牌生成。

Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large
language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest
that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct
roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers
handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract
representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations
have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states
may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple
tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse
the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct
Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces
no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification.
Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model
has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with
only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its
performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

### [10] [Scaling Long-Horizon LLM Agent via Context-Folding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11967)
*Weiwei Sun,Miao Lu,Zhan Ling,Kang Liu,Xuesong Yao,Yiming Yang,Jiecao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Context-Folding框架让LLM智能体能够主动管理工作上下文，通过程序化分支处理子任务并在完成后折叠中间步骤，从而在长视野任务中显著减少上下文使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体在长视野任务中受限于上下文长度，需要一种有效的方法来管理上下文。

Method: 开发了端到端强化学习框架FoldGRPO，通过特定过程奖励鼓励有效的任务分解和上下文管理，使智能体能够分支处理子任务并折叠中间步骤。

Result: 在复杂长视野任务（深度研究和软件工程）上，折叠智能体的性能与ReAct基线相当或更好，同时使用的活动上下文减少了10倍，并且显著优于基于摘要的上下文管理模型。

Conclusion: Context-Folding框架通过主动上下文管理有效解决了LLM智能体在长视野任务中的上下文限制问题。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context
length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that
empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can
procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it
upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise
summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process
rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On
complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches
or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$
smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based
context management.

### [11] [Conjecturing: An Overlooked Step in Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11986)
*Jasivan Alex Sivakumar,Philipp Borchert,Ronald Cardenas,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了ConjectureBench数据集和评估框架，专门衡量LLMs的猜想能力，发现当前模型的自动形式化性能被高估，并设计了Lean-FIRe方法提升猜想和自动形式化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动形式化研究忽视了猜想这一关键前置步骤，许多数学问题需要先猜想结论才能进行形式化。LLMs在猜想能力方面的评估有限且与自动形式化或证明任务纠缠，难以理解其影响。

Method: 扩充现有数据集创建ConjectureBench，重新设计评估框架和指标来专门衡量LLMs的猜想能力；设计推理时方法Lean-FIRe来改进猜想和自动形式化。

Result: 评估显示GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1等基础模型的自动形式化性能在考虑猜想因素后被显著高估；使用Lean-FIRe方法，GPT-4.1成功端到端自动形式化了13个PutnamBench问题，DeepSeek-V3.1成功形式化了7个。

Conclusion: LLMs具备生成准确猜想所需的知识，但提升自动形式化性能需要将猜想视为独立任务，并研究如何正确将其整合到自动形式化流程中。论文为改进形式数学推理中被忽视的猜想步骤提供了前瞻性指导。

Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in
formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,
however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical
problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion
such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their
conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or
proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this
gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the
evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing
capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation
pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is
substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during
evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We
design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and
autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first
successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1
and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite
knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation
performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and
investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.
Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward
improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

*Ryan Shea,Yunan Lu,Liang Qiu,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个用于多轮交互式代理评估的用户模拟框架，通过整合业务背景知识（如理想客户画像和业务基础设施）来生成更真实多样的交互，能发现更多代理错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模拟用户方法通常建模通用用户，忽视了捕获真实行为所需的领域特定原则，导致评估效果有限。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，整合自上而下的业务逻辑知识（如理想客户画像）和自下而上的业务基础设施知识（如产品目录、FAQ），生成基于现实客户角色的用户行为。

Result: 该方法生成的交互更真实多样，能识别多达33%的代理错误，在支持错误发现和迭代改进方面更有效。

Conclusion: SAGE通过整合业务背景知识，显著提升了多轮交互代理评估的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for
human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an
alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and
overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior.
We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent
Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates
top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles,
grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate
bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product
catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate
interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a
company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this
approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also
identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an
evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

### [13] [Generate Logical Equivalence Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12001)
*Xinyu Wang,Haoming Yu,Yicheng Yang,Zhiyuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自动问题生成方法，用于离散数学中的逻辑等价问题，通过形式化语言定义问题并开发线性时间算法，解决了现有方法效率低和难度不均的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教学时代抄袭问题日益严重，需要为每个学生生成独特问题来防止作弊，同时提供大量练习题。现有逻辑等价问题生成方法效率低且难度不均。

Method: 使用形式化语言定义逻辑等价问题，将其转换为两套生成规则，并开发线性时间算法进行问题生成。

Result: 学生测试显示生成问题的准确性与教科书问题相当；难度评估表明生成问题与教科书问题难度相似，优于大型语言模型生成的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效生成高质量的逻辑等价问题，准确性和难度与教科书问题相当，为在线教学提供了有效的防抄袭解决方案。

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet
plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and
learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to
mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally,
AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on
generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a
foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature
review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all
propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies
and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new
approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language,
translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a
linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two
experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions
generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these
questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment
assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions,
textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The
results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of

*Alice Saebom Kwak,Maria Alexeeva,Gus Hahn-Powell,Keith Alcock,Kevin McLaughlin,Doug McCorkle,Gabe McNunn,Mihai Surdeanu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较神经符号系统和LLM系统在农业领域信息抽取的表现，LLM系统在F1分数上表现更好（69.4 vs 52.7），但各有优缺点：神经符号系统运行快、可控性强但缺乏泛化能力；LLM系统性能高、部署快但运行慢、控制有限且有幻觉风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前信息抽取领域过度依赖大语言模型，忽视了传统符号或统计系统的经验积累，需要比较不同方法的实际表现。

Method: 在农业领域（猪肉、奶制品和作物子领域）对9个访谈进行对比评估，比较神经符号系统和LLM系统在信息抽取任务中的表现。

Result: LLM系统在总体F1分数（69.4 vs 52.7）和核心信息F1分数（63.0 vs 47.2）上都优于神经符号系统。

Conclusion: 部署NLP系统存在"隐藏成本"，需要在性能、效率和可控性之间找到平衡点。

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on
large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building
symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS)
and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine
interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system
outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where
total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details.
However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime,
greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks
generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant
resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher
performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime,
limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings
highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world
applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and
control.

*Jung-Woo Shim,Yeong-Joon Ju,Ji-Hoon Park,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR)的即插即用框架，通过清理不良提示和生成额外任务描述来减少LLM的幻觉问题，显著提高了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型有时会生成看似合理但实际错误的"幻觉"事实，这通常是由用户使用结构不良或模糊的提示导致的，使得模型基于假设而非实际意图生成响应。

Method: CPR框架使用微调的小型语言模型来：1）清理结构不良的提示；2）生成额外的信息性任务描述，以对齐用户意图和提示内容。

Result: 实证研究表明，应用CPR的提示在没有任何外部知识的情况下，相比原始提示获得了超过90%的胜率，显著提高了生成质量并减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: CPR框架能有效减轻由不良提示引起的幻觉问题，提高语言模型生成质量，且无需依赖外部知识。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency
in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes
generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A
frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly
structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed
rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these
ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a
plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans
ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions
to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small
language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR
significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating
hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves
over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了多阶段提示优化框架MPR，通过系统化改进格式错误的提示来减少大语言模型的幻觉问题，在幻觉基准测试中优化后的提示胜率超过85%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在幻觉问题上仍面临挑战，特别是格式错误的提示（包含歧义、语法错误或不完整信息）对幻觉的影响研究不足。

Method: MPR框架通过多阶段系统化改进提示，每个阶段针对特定错误（如标点、拼写错误、关键词误用），使用微调的小语言模型，并通过自反思机制和排序来优先处理最相关的输入。

Result: 在幻觉基准测试中，经MPR优化的提示相比原始形式胜率超过85%，证明能有效减少幻觉并提高LLM输出准确性。

Conclusion: MPR提供了一个轻量级且适应性强的解决方案，可与现有的事后幻觉缓解框架结合，增强大语言模型在各领域的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However,
LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models
generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute
to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous
wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under
explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a
framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across
multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation,
typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models
(SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of
prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with
ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on
hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\%
win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we
reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation
frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and
adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在实际应用中存在可靠性问题，容易产生看似合理但事实错误的幻觉输出，需要通过不确定性量化来评估模型生成的可信度。

Method: 系统性地分类了现有不确定性量化方法，从形式定义到传统不确定性区分（认知不确定性和偶然不确定性），并展示了代表性方法的实证结果。

Result: 不确定性量化为识别不可靠生成提供了机制，能够有效检测大语言模型的幻觉输出，提高模型可靠性。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化是大语言模型幻觉检测的重要研究方向，当前已有多种方法但仍有局限性，需要进一步研究来完善这一领域。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide
range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text
summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised
concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to
hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to
address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the
trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations
of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between
epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have
been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of
UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a
mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We
systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple
dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches.
Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research
directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for
hallucination detection.

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的提示词重写框架，通过奖励系统和迭代DPO训练优化文本到图像生成中的提示词，无需监督微调数据，能提升图像-文本对齐度、视觉质量和美学效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理简单或不够详细的提示词时表现不佳，导致图像与文本对齐度、美学质量和整体效果不理想。

Method: 使用大语言模型作为提示词重写器，引入精心设计的奖励系统和迭代直接偏好优化训练流程，无需监督微调数据即可优化提示词。

Result: 在多种T2I模型和基准测试中，提示词重写器持续提升图像-文本对齐度、视觉质量和美学效果，优于强基线方法，且具有良好的跨模型迁移能力。

Conclusion: 提示词重写是一种有效、可扩展且实用的模型无关策略，能够显著改进文本到图像生成系统。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified
prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.
We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our
approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct
preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to
enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our
method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt
rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and
aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone
generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also
systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with
the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight
that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic
strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained
prompt rewriters soon.

### [20] [Hierarchical Alignment: Surgical Fine-Tuning via Functional Layer Specialization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12044)
*Yukun Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了分层对齐方法，针对Transformer架构中不同功能层（局部、中间、全局）分别应用DPO优化，避免了传统统一优化的"对齐税"问题，在保持语法流畅性的同时显著提升事实一致性和逻辑连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐技术将LLM视为单一实体进行统一优化，忽视了Transformer架构中不同层的功能专门化（从语法处理到抽象推理），导致优化效果受限并产生"对齐税"问题。

Method: 分层对齐方法：将模型层划分为局部（语法）、中间（逻辑）和全局（事实性）三个功能块，使用LoRA进行精准微调，对每个功能块分别应用目标DPO优化。

Result: 局部层对齐提升语法流畅性；全局层对齐不仅改善事实一致性，还成为提升逻辑连贯性的最有效策略，优于所有基线方法；所有分层策略都成功避免了标准DPO中的"对齐税"问题。

Conclusion: 分层对齐为模型对齐提供了更资源高效、可控和可解释的路径，展示了从整体优化转向结构感知精准微调的巨大潜力，有助于构建更先进可靠的LLM。

Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic
entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach
overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,
where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to
abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm
by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO
to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate
(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for
surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,
demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning
the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly,
aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency
as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing
logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical
strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO,
where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These
findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable
path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from
monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more
advanced and reliable LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: APCE提出了一种上下文感知的输入块选择方法，通过低维语义相似度匹配来筛选最重要的输入块，从而在长文本摘要任务中同时减少内存占用和缓解ContextRot现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文Transformer模型的两个关键挑战：(1) 由于二次自注意力和线性KV缓存扩展导致的内存占用增长；(2) ContextRot现象，即模型性能随上下文长度增加而下降。

Method: APCE通过低维语义相似度匹配，选择与当前查询最相关的输入块进行处理，直接从输入层面操作，不依赖底层硬件或CUDA环境。

Result: 在仅使用50%-70%输入序列的情况下，APCE在摘要任务上表现优于或与完整密集基线相当，同时显著改善了KV缓存和自注意力的内存效率。

Conclusion: APCE为长上下文Transformer模型提供了一种上下文感知的效率解决方案，有望激发针对其他相关长上下文任务的进一步研究。

Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing
two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic
self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length
increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that
transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length.
Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we
surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to
synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the
ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative
for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware
solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional
semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on
the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA
environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment
systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par
summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a
fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and
self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire
further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards
other relevant long-context tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了Verily行为健康安全过滤器(VBHSF)在精神健康危机检测中的性能，相比其他开源内容审核护栏，VBHSF在敏感性和特异性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理精神健康紧急情况时经常提供有害或不适当的建议，需要开发有效的安全过滤器来防止这些风险。

Method: 使用两个数据集评估VBHSF：Verily精神健康危机数据集(1,800条模拟消息)和NVIDIA Aegis AI内容安全数据集子集(794条精神健康相关消息)，并与OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest和NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails进行比较分析。

Result: VBHSF在Verily数据集上表现出色：敏感性0.990，特异性0.992，F1分数0.939；在NVIDIA数据集上保持高敏感性(0.982)和准确性(0.921)。相比其他护栏，VBHSF在所有情况下敏感性显著更高(p<0.001)。

Conclusion: VBHSF展示了稳健、可泛化的性能，优先考虑敏感性以最小化遗漏危机，这对医疗应用至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering
harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study
evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets:
the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and
the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental
health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we
evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out
comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation
guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF
demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis
Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in
detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939,
sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in
identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis
AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive
(0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared
with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF
demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving
significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher
specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni
Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest
exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with
sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF
demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to
minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 提出PACE方法，通过生成平行关联链来评估LLM的创造力，避免数据污染问题，与人类评估高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM创造力评估面临数据污染和人工评估成本高的问题，需要更高效可靠的评估方法。

Method: PACE方法要求LLM生成平行关联链，通过分析关联模式来评估创造力。

Result: PACE与Chatbot Arena创造力排名高度相关（Spearman's ρ=0.739），高性能LLM达到普通人水平，但专业人士仍优于LLM。人类和LLM都显示关联具体性下降趋势，人类关联模式更多样。

Conclusion: PACE是评估LLM创造力的有效方法，LLM在创造力方面已接近普通人水平，但与专业人士仍有差距。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain,
though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often
impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we
propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate
their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a
straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong
correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho =
0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A
comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals
that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human
performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore,
linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of
decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a
greater diversity of associative patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言领域适应(ML-DA)中，知识如何在语言内学习和跨语言迁移的机制尚未充分探索，导致在低资源场景下性能不佳。现有研究常使用知识覆盖不匹配的数据集进行训练和评估。

Method: 提出AdaXEval自适应评估方法，从训练用的双语领域语料构建多选QA数据集；通过不同数据配方的持续训练，追踪LLMs获取领域事实的过程，分析从训练数据到知识的转化机制。

Result: 在13B英日双语LLM上的实验表明，即使使用高质量双语语料，跨语言知识迁移仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 跨语言知识迁移在多语言领域适应中仍然困难，需要更深入理解LLMs的知识获取机制。

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain
knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many
methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of
multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a
language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work
examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA
studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge
coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds
multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for
training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through
continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire
domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from
domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese
bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a
high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

Motivation: 大型语音语言模型在对话生成方面表现出色，但在语义理解基准测试中始终落后于传统流水线系统，需要深入理解这种性能差距的原因。

Method: 通过分析粗粒度和细粒度的文本与语音表征，发现深层表征在方向上的对齐与幅度上的分离，并引入对齐路径评分来量化标记级对齐质量。基于这些发现设计了角度投影和长度归一化等干预策略。

Result: 研究发现表征相似性与模态差距强相关，且标记级对齐模式与模态差距有更强的相关性。提出的干预策略显示出改善语音输入正确性的潜力。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统分析了大型语音语言模型中的模态差距和对齐机制，为未来优化提供了理论和方法的指导。

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive
conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional
pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal
through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input
performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between
speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality
gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and
speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech
and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction
(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean
distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly
correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous
token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is
observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify
token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the
modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on
critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These
strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.
Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap
and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological
guidance for future optimization.

TL;DR: SafeMT是一个多模态大语言模型安全基准，包含10,000个多轮对话样本，涵盖17种场景和4种越狱方法，用于评估MLLMs在多轮对话中的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的广泛使用，安全问题日益突出。多轮对话在日常交互中更常见，但现有基准未能充分考虑这种情况，存在更大的安全风险。

Method: 提出SafeMT基准，包含不同长度的对话样本，由有害查询和图像生成；提出安全指数(SI)评估模型对话安全性；设计对话安全调节器检测对话中的恶意意图。

Result: 评估17个模型发现，随着有害对话轮数增加，成功攻击风险上升，表明模型安全机制在识别对话交互危险方面不足。实验表明提出的调节器比现有防护模型更能有效降低多轮攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在多轮对话中的安全机制存在不足，需要专门的安全评估基准和防护措施来应对日益复杂的安全威胁。

Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety
issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more
common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;
however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To
encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in
multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues
of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This
benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different
scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index
(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess
the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of
successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful
dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these
models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We
propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent
concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety
policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that
this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed
guard models.

TL;DR: Credal Transformer通过引入基于证据理论的Credal注意力机制替代标准注意力，用分布集合表示不确定性，显著减少LLM的幻觉和过度自信错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM因Transformer的Softmax函数产生'人工确定性'而导致的幻觉问题，该问题将模糊的注意力分数压缩为单一概率分布，丢弃了不确定性信息。

Method: 用Credal注意力机制(CAM)替代标准注意力，将注意力分数重新概念化为Dirichlet分布的证据质量，生成表示不确定性的'credal set'分布集合。

Result: Credal Transformer能够识别分布外输入、量化模糊性，并在无法回答的问题上通过弃权显著减少自信错误。

Conclusion: 提出了一种减轻幻觉的新架构和设计范式，将不确定性量化直接集成到模型中，为更可靠的AI奠定基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet
confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax
function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous
attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty
information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,
which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based
on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions)
instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring
model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as
evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers
standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,
representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies
out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces
confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a
new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that
integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a
foundation for more reliable AI.

Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), parallel
reasoning has emerged as a new inference paradigm that enhances reasoning
robustness by concurrently exploring multiple lines of thought before
converging on a final answer. It has become a significant trend to explore
parallel reasoning to overcome the fragility of standard sequential methods and
improve practical performance. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize
the progress and challenges of parallel reasoning. We first present a formal
definition of parallel reasoning and clarify its distinction from related
concepts like Chain-of-Thought. Then, we organize and discuss advanced
techniques based on a novel taxonomy, including non-interactive reasoning,
interactive reasoning, and efficiency-focused decoding strategies.
Additionally, we explore various application scenarios, such as solving complex
problems and enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.Finally, we highlight the
core challenges of parallel reasoning and suggest potential directions for
future research. We hope that our work can provide a useful roadmap for
beginners and encourage more research on improving parallel reasoning methods.

*Minghan Wang,Thuy-Trang Vu,Ehsan Shareghi,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了将离散空间中的推理技术（多样本生成和PRM/ORM重排序）适配到连续空间推理的可行性，发现在COCONUT连续推理LM上虽然能生成多样化推理路径，但PRM/ORM模型在连续空间中效果有限，主要原因是缺乏关键的归纳偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索已证明在离散文本推理中有效的多样本生成和奖励模型重排序技术，是否能够成功应用于连续空间推理任务。

Method: 使用COCONUT连续空间推理LM作为骨干，通过dropout-based采样生成多样化推理路径，训练PRM和ORM模型进行重排序，并分析几何特性和轨迹动态。

Result: Pass@N分析显示在连续空间中存在显著的性能提升潜力，但PRM和ORM模型仅带来边际改进，无法有效区分正确和错误推理。

Conclusion: 连续推理LM的训练框架不仅需要优化准确性，还应明确纳入可用于推理时区分正确和错误思维的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with
Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective
for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates
whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in
the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space
reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating
diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on
the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant
gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we
highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous
thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training
PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in
the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric
properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that
prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning
(essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that
current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous
thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous
reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly
incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for
discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data
will be publicly available.}

TL;DR: LLaDR是一个基于大语言模型的药物重定位框架，通过从LLM中提取生物医学实体的语义丰富文本表示来优化知识图谱嵌入模型，从而改进生物医学概念表示并提升药物重定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了真实实验室中的常识性生物医学概念知识，如某些药物与特定治疗根本不相容的机制先验知识，导致生物医学知识图谱表示不足。

Method: 从大语言模型中提取语义丰富的治疗相关文本表示，用于微调知识图谱嵌入模型，将治疗相关知识注入KGE中。

Result: 在基准测试中达到最先进性能，阿尔茨海默病案例研究进一步证实了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: LLaDR通过注入LLM的治疗相关知识，显著改善了生物医学概念表示，增强了语义理解能力，为复杂疾病药物重定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,
especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),
which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support
this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical
concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating
that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To
address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework
for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts
within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related
textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models
(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By
injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the
representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of
under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different
scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its
robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究大型音频语言模型(LALMs)中的时间偏差问题，发现模型在预测事件时间戳时存在系统性偏差，且偏差随音频长度增加而累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在音频理解和多模态推理中应用日益广泛，但其定位事件发生时间的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 在带时间戳的数据集上进行控制实验，量化时间偏差效应，提出时间偏差指数(TBI)来衡量预测事件时间的系统性错位，并辅以可视化框架。

Result: 研究发现：(i)时间偏差在数据集和模型中普遍存在；(ii)偏差随音频长度增加而累积，在长录音中可达数十秒；(iii)不同事件类型和位置的偏差程度不同。

Conclusion: 当前LALMs存在基本的时间定位限制，需要开发具有时间鲁棒性的架构。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio
understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events
occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal
bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For
example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key
formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or
later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped
datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and
models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds
in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We
quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic
misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization
framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and
call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

*Zeyu Yang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM和DPO的语音翻译分割框架，通过偏好对齐提升分割质量，在多个语言对上超越现有方法，改善翻译质量和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型如SHAS虽然比启发式方法更鲁棒，但受限于监督学习目标，缺乏人类偏好对齐，难以满足实时翻译的自然性需求。

Method: 使用基于大语言模型的分割框架，通过直接偏好优化训练，使LLM能预测更符合人类偏好的自然分割点。

Result: 在ACL 60/60语料库的英-日、中、德语对上，DPO调优的LLM分割准确率高于SHAS，翻译质量(BLEU、COMET)和延迟(平均滞后)均有改善。

Conclusion: 偏好调优的LLM有潜力超越现有预训练分割模型，推动自适应、人类对齐的同步口译发展。

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance
translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced
pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic
rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more
robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning
objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial
for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation
framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs
to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of
real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across
three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2
as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM
achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent
improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average
Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct
comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to
surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,
human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

*Ali Mekky,Omar El Herraoui,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HALF框架，用于评估LLM在真实应用场景中的偏见，并按危害严重性对结果进行加权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估缺乏真实场景基础，未考虑不同领域危害严重性的差异，如手术偏见与文本风格偏见的危害程度不同。

Method: HALF框架将9个应用领域分为三个严重等级（严重、中等、轻度），使用五阶段流程进行评估。

Result: 评估8个LLM发现：(1) LLM在不同领域公平性不一致；(2) 模型大小或性能不能保证公平性；(3) 推理模型在医疗决策支持中表现更好但在教育中更差。

Conclusion: HALF揭示了先前基准测试成功与部署准备度之间的明显差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact
domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and
education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical.
However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not
account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery
should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To
address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a
deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications
and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application
domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline.
Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not
consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not
guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision
support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap
between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

TL;DR: 研究发现微调后的大语言模型会学习到Knobe效应这种道德偏见，通过层修补分析发现偏见集中在特定层，用预训练模型的激活修补这些层可以消除偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在微调过程中如何内化人类偏见，特别是Knobe效应这种道德判断偏见，并研究其具体机制。

Method: 在3个开源权重的大语言模型上进行层修补分析，识别导致偏见的特定层，并用预训练模型的激活来修补这些层。

Result: 发现Knobe效应偏见确实在微调过程中被学习，且集中在特定层，仅修补少数关键层就能消除这种偏见。

Conclusion: 大语言模型中的社会偏见可以被解释、定位和缓解，无需重新训练模型，为偏见干预提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases
during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain
unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a
moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether
it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a
Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the
bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set
of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the
corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in
LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted
interventions, without the need for model retraining.

*Jiakai Li,Rongzheng Wang,Yizhuo Ma,Shuang Liang,Guangchun Luo,Ke Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DSAS方法解决LLM在多文档问答中的长距离依赖建模和"中间信息丢失"问题，无需修改架构或额外训练参数，在多个主流LLM上平均F1分数提升4.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多文档问答任务中存在两个主要限制：长距离依赖建模困难，无法关注长文本中的关键信息；"中间信息丢失"问题，难以处理长输入中间位置的信息。现有解决方案要么截断全局依赖，要么需要昂贵的微调，缺乏通用简单的解决方案。

Method: 提出双阶段自适应锐化(DSAS)方法，包含两个模块：上下文门控权重(CGW)模块通过层级注意力跟踪和位置感知权重评估段落相关性，缓解"中间信息丢失"；互斥注意力抑制(RAS)模块通过抑制关键文本与无关文本之间的信息交换，增强对关键段落的关注，改善长距离依赖建模。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DSAS在主流LLM（Llama、Qwen、Mistral和Deepseek）上均有效，在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct上的多文档问答任务中平均F1分数提升4.2%。消融研究确认了CGW和RAS模块的必要贡献。

Conclusion: DSAS作为一种即插即用的解决方案，无需架构修改或额外训练参数，有效解决了LLM在多文档问答中的关键限制，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various
fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question
answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency
modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which
weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the
''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information
in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global
dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and
simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose
Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The
Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by
assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and
position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)
module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information
exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in
long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play
solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across
mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score
improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of
both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix
further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

TL;DR: MedQA-Followup框架评估医疗大语言模型在多轮对话中的鲁棒性，发现模型在受到间接上下文干扰时准确率大幅下降，从91.2%降至13.5%，暴露了临床部署的重大漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要针对单轮问答的理想条件，忽略了医疗咨询中常见的冲突输入、误导性上下文和权威影响等复杂情况，需要系统评估多轮对话鲁棒性。

Method: 引入MedQA-Followup框架，区分浅层鲁棒性（抵抗误导初始上下文）和深层鲁棒性（在答案被挑战时保持准确性），并引入间接-直接轴来区分上下文框架和明确建议。

Result: 五个最先进LLM在浅层干扰下表现尚可，但在多轮设置中表现出严重脆弱性。间接、基于上下文的干预比直接建议更具破坏性，导致模型准确率大幅下降。

Conclusion: 多轮鲁棒性是医疗LLM安全可靠部署的关键但未充分探索的维度，需要进一步研究以应对临床环境中的复杂交互。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical
use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains
poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn
question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of
medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and
authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for
systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.
Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading
initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are
challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that
separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).
Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under
shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn
settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude
Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often
more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across
models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.
Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing
additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others
partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn
robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable
deployment of medical LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了Chinese ModernBERT，一个从头开始训练的中文编码器，通过定制32k BPE词汇表、动态掩码课程、两阶段预训练和阻尼余弦学习率调度，在中文NLP任务上实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer改进主要针对英语，未能充分转移到中文，因为中文在分词和形态上与英语存在显著差异。

Method: 使用硬件感知的32k BPE词汇表、动态全词掩码、两阶段预训练（扩展到8192上下文长度）和阻尼余弦学习率调度。

Result: 在CLUE基准测试中与强中文编码器竞争，在SimCLUE上达到0.505（Pearson）/0.537（Spearman），超越Qwen-0.6B-embedding。

Conclusion: Chinese ModernBERT展示了中文编码器的有效设计，通过预算分配和注意力设计实现了高性能，为检索导向任务提供了清晰的扩展路径。

Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,
data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory
efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where
tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese
ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware
32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the
embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking
curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)
a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to
8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a
damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We
pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and
Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong
Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves
high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,
reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe
retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:
fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking
(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.
Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding
on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated
pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible
research.

Motivation: 解决语料库快速扩张时人工标注成为方法瓶颈的问题，探索大语言模型在语料语言学工作中的自动化应用潜力。

Method: 采用四阶段工作流程：提示工程、事前评估、自动化批量处理、事后验证，使用GPT-5通过OpenAI API进行标注。

Result: 在60小时内标注了COHA语料库中的143,933个句子，在两个复杂标注任务上达到98%以上的准确率。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够以最小人工干预大规模执行数据准备任务，为基于语料库的研究开辟了新可能性，但需要考虑成本、许可和伦理问题。

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual
annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic
work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline
for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large
language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches,
our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc
evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate
the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study
of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the
OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two
sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform
a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,
opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation
requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

<details>

Motivation: 现有反言论生成方法存在可靠性不足和可扩展性差的问题，需要构建可信且连贯的反言论生成系统来应对仇恨言论。

Method: 使用RAG技术构建包含32,792个文本的知识库，将反言论生成建模为知识驱动的文本生成过程，针对8个目标群体进行优化。

Result: 在MultiTarget-CONAN数据集上的评估显示，该方法在JudgeLM指标和人工评估中均优于标准LLM基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究可信和合理的反言论生成奠定了基础，可应用于仇恨言论及其他领域。

Abstract: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as
fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work
treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on
Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks
due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text,
and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel
framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation
process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main
target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people
of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons,
and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library,
EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792
texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality
of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM)
and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard
LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting
framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and
sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型与人类大脑活动之间的对齐可以揭示语言处理的计算原理，特别是解决关于大脑对齐与下一个词预测关系这一有争议的研究问题。

Method: 引入细粒度输入归因方法，识别对大脑-LLM对齐最重要的具体词语，并比较大脑对齐和下一个词预测所依赖的词语子集。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了我们对LLM与人类语言处理关系的理解，突出了大脑对齐和下一个词预测在特征依赖方面的差异。归因方法可广泛应用于探索模型预测在各种语言处理任务中的认知相关性。

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language
processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify
the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to
study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the
relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our
findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP
exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA
prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted
recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to
human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance
between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly
applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse
language processing tasks.

TL;DR: MoBiLE是一个即插即用的MoE推理框架，通过混合大小专家机制，对不重要token使用半数量专家加速，同时为重要token保留完整专家以保证质量，实现了1.60x-1.72x的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型的卸载策略受限于CPU-GPU互连带宽，预取方法训练开销大且在细粒度专家分割的现代MoE模型中效果不佳。

Method: 提出混合大小专家机制，减少不重要token的专家数量以加速，同时为重要token保留完整专家；设计专门的回退和预取机制在大小专家间切换以提高内存效率。

Result: 在四种典型现代MoE架构和生成任务上，MoBiLE在消费级GPU系统上相比基线实现了1.60x到1.72x的加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: MoBiLE框架有效解决了MoE推理中的带宽瓶颈问题，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional
performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse
activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active
experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU
DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by
the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,
existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.
These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using
specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered
by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on
recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE
inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the
number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while
maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.
Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for
switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We
evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging
generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to
1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible
degradation in accuracy.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在学术评审中存在系统性偏见：倾向于给LLM生成的论文打高分，而对包含批判性陈述的人类论文评分偏低，揭示了在学术评审中使用LLM的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在学术工作流程中的深度整合，需要探索其在研究和评审双重角色中可能带来的新风险，特别是对学术公平性的影响。

Method: 通过模拟实验，设置研究代理生成和修改论文，评审代理评估提交的论文，并结合人工标注分析LLM评审与人类判断的差异。

Result: 发现LLM评审存在两种主要偏见：对LLM生成写作风格的语言特征偏好，以及对批判性陈述的厌恶，导致对LLM论文评分虚高，对人类批判性论文评分偏低。

Conclusion: 在学术评审中部署LLM需要谨慎，以避免对人类作者和学术研究造成风险和公平性担忧，但LLM指导的修改确实能提升论文质量，对早期研究人员和低质量论文有积极作用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow,
potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous
studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review,
their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between
research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this
study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and
research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential
risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a
research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,
which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct
human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based
reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores
for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than
human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored
papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple
revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM
reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and
an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and
equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are
deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand,
revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human
evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for
early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.

TL;DR: 该研究对200多种语言进行大规模跨语言标记化效率评估，发现拉丁文字语言标记化效率高，而非拉丁文字和形态复杂语言标记化成本显著增加3-5倍，导致计算成本增加和有效上下文利用率降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标记化差异阻碍了语言多样化群体公平获取人工智能服务，需要系统量化大型语言模型中的计算不平等问题。

Method: 使用标准化实验框架，通过tiktoken库对200多种语言样本进行统一标记化处理，收集Tokens Per Sentence (TPS)和Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC)等评估指标。

Result: 拉丁文字语言标记化效率高，非拉丁文字和形态复杂语言标记化成本显著增加3-5倍，导致计算成本增加和有效上下文利用率降低。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统存在结构性不平等，低资源和非拉丁语言使用者面临不成比例的计算劣势，未来应开发考虑语言类型多样性的标记化策略和自适应词汇构建方法。

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable
access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations.
This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization
efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational
inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental
framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols,
followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all
language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using
established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and
Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our
cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities:
Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency,
while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly
greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These
inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced
effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the
findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers
of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational
disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of
linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary
construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more
inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

TL;DR: PRoH是一个动态规划和推理框架，通过上下文感知规划、结构化问题分解和实体加权重叠引导的检索算法，解决了知识超图在检索增强生成中的静态规划、非自适应检索和浅层结构利用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识超图的RAG方法存在静态检索规划、非自适应检索执行以及对超图结构和语义的浅层利用三大局限，限制了多跳问答的有效性。

Method: PRoH包含三个核心创新：上下文感知规划模块、结构化问题分解过程和实体加权重叠引导的推理路径检索算法。

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，PRoH实现了最先进性能，平均F1分数比之前的SOTA模型HyperGraphRAG高出19.73%，生成评估分数高出8.41%，在长距离多跳推理任务中保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PRoH通过动态规划和推理框架有效克服了知识超图在RAG中的现有局限，显著提升了多跳问答性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge
representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to
model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based
RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,
non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and
semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop
question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic
Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates
three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the
local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;
(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as
a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,
multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided
reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent
hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model
HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation
(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop
reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统存在不忠实问题，模型响应与检索证据相矛盾。现有方法将LLM视为黑盒，忽视了LLM内部如何整合检索证据与参数记忆的关键问题。

Method: 通过隐藏状态表示分析发现知识整合是分层的，冲突在句子层面表现为潜在信号。提出CLEAR框架：将上下文分解为细粒度句子级知识，使用隐藏状态探测定位冲突知识，引入冲突感知微调指导模型准确整合检索证据。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CLEAR显著提高了准确性和上下文忠实性，在各种冲突条件下始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CLEAR通过揭示LLM内部知识整合机制并提出针对性解决方案，有效提升了RAG系统的忠实性表现。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG
systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response
contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to
improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such
as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These
works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does
the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,
particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a
probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe
three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest
as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often
amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,
we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a
framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level
knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,
and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to
accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three
benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and
contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under
diverse conflict conditions. The related resources are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过多语言Wug测试评估LLM在形态学泛化任务中的表现，发现模型能像人类一样处理未见词汇，但准确性主要受训练数据量而非语言复杂度影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM的语言能力是否接近人类水平，以及模型表现主要受语言结构复杂性还是训练数据量的影响。

Method: 使用多语言Wug测试，在四种语言（加泰罗尼亚语、英语、希腊语、西班牙语）上测试六个模型，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 模型能以人类水平的准确性泛化形态学过程，但准确性模式更符合社区规模和数据可用性，而非结构复杂性。西班牙语和英语表现优于加泰罗尼亚语和希腊语。

Conclusion: 模型行为主要由语言资源丰富度驱动，而非对语法复杂性的敏感性，其表现仅表面类似人类语言能力。

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing
debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model
performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.
Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across
four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and
compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy
approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic
complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with
previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize
morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,
accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability
than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In
particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital
representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than
less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that
model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather
than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance
that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

TL;DR: 提出SMEC框架，通过序列嵌套表示学习、自适应维度选择和可选择性跨批次记忆模块，在保持性能的同时显著降低LLM嵌入维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的高维嵌入虽然语义丰富，但计算复杂度和存储需求高，阻碍实际部署。

Method: 使用SMRL方法减少训练梯度方差，ADS模块降低维度剪枝信息损失，S-XBM模块增强高低维嵌入的无监督学习。

Result: 在图像、文本和多模态数据集上验证，SMEC显著降维且保持性能，在BEIR数据集上256维嵌入性能优于对比方法1.1-2.7点。

Conclusion: SMEC框架有效解决LLM嵌入高维问题，实现高效压缩同时保持语义信息。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that
capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional
embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements,
thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression
(SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation
Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the
Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation
during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module
to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings.
Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC
achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance.
For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of
compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points
compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

Motivation: 大型语言模型能够生成模仿个人风格的文本，这增加了身份冒充的风险，但目前没有针对个性化机器生成文本检测的研究。

Method: 构建了包含文学作品和博客文本及其LLM生成模仿的基准数据集，提出了基于特征反转陷阱的检测器性能预测方法。

Result: 实验结果显示在个性化设置下，一些最先进的检测器性能显著下降，提出的预测方法与实际性能差距有85%的相关性。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了个性化文本检测的挑战，提出的方法能有效预测检测器性能变化，鼓励进一步研究个性化文本检测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,
producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also
heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In
this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector
robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired
with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large
performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some
state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation
to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative
in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized
text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to
predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method
identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs
probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector
dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the
direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation
with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further
research on personalized text detection.

Motivation: 测试时缩放技术目前仅限于数学和编程等有明确正确答案的领域，本研究旨在将其扩展到评估标注分歧的LeWiDi任务中。

Method: 使用三种测试时缩放方法：模型平均、多数投票和Best-of-N采样，在LeWiDi-2025任务上进行实验。

Result: 两个基准方法（模型平均和多数投票）在LeWiDi任务上持续提升LLM性能，但Best-of-N方法无效。

Conclusion: Best-of-N方法目前无法从数学领域迁移到LeWiDi任务，分析了这种差距的潜在原因。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at
inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge,
test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers,
like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025
tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time
scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority
Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM
performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does
not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently
transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for
this gap.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在处理典型和非典型实例时如何权衡语用先验（输入相关性）和语义先验（概念通用性），理解模型在假设违反时的表现。

Method: 构建VISaGE评估数据集，包含典型和异常图像，通过精心平衡的实验设计分析VLMs的权衡行为。

Result: 当语用先验的输入一致性假设被违反时，概念理解能力下降；语用先验对个别实例查询的影响比语义先验更强。

Conclusion: VLMs在处理非典型实例时更依赖语用先验而非语义先验，这揭示了模型在现实场景中的局限性。

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the
form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to
analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this
paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a
pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising
from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that
the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.
In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new
evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.
In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding
degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is
violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of
the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT)方法，通过微调让LLM能够忠实地表达不确定性，而不改变其答案分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常错误传达其不确定性：重复查询会产生不同的答案，但生成的响应通常没有或使用了不能反映这种变异性的不确定性修饰语，这造成了忠实性差距。

Method: 通过增强模型样本与不确定性修饰语（如'可能'或'很可能'）来构建训练数据，这些修饰语与样本一致性对齐，只需要模型和一组提示即可，无需额外监督。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的开放域问答评估显示，FUT显著减少了忠实性差距，同时保持了问答准确性并引入了最小的语义分布偏移。

Conclusion: FUT是一种简单有效的方法，可以教会LLM忠实地传达不确定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated
queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically
unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys
unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,
creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce
Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches
instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their
underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model
samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or
'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the
model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering
(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT
substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and
introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate
robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of
uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a
simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

Conclusion: 风格信号为区分机器生成文本提供了可解释的证据，StyleDecipher框架实现了准确、可解释且领域无关的检测，无需依赖模型内部信息。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into
open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical
task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on
statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between
LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in
real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to
paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic
diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose
StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits
LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify
stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and
continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,
StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and
LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables
accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access
to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five
diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,
demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain
accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing
baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial
perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative
analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for
distinguishing machine-generated text. Our source code can be accessed at

Result: COSTAR-A能提升本地化LLMs在某些任务中的输出结构和决策性，但效果因模型和用例而异。Llama 3.1-8B模型使用COSTAR-A时表现优于单独使用COSTAR。

Conclusion: COSTAR-A作为一个提示框架具有适应性和可扩展性，特别适用于资源受限硬件上的计算高效AI部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and
making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent,
high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt
engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands
for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the
'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR
framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its
performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,
particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.
Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most
8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance
the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,
although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the
Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with
COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability
and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in
computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

TL;DR: 本文提出PARO框架，通过让LLM学习任务特定的推理模式来自动生成标注，可在不损失性能的情况下将人工标注成本降低10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SFT+RLVR范式需要昂贵的人工标注推理轨迹，本文旨在研究如何在不影响推理性能的情况下大幅降低标注成本。

Method: 提出PARO框架，识别模式化推理任务，让LLM学习共享的推理模式来自动生成标注，无需人工标注推理轨迹。

Result: 实验显示PARO生成的标注与10倍规模的人工标注在SFT+RLVR性能上相当。

Conclusion: 大规模人工标注可被仅需有限人工监督的LLM自动标注替代，显著降低标注成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories
(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model
using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating
high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This
paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially
reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class
of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,
procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in
content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the
solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the
success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable
models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic
matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral
evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of
rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,
we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with
task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.
Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR
performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest
that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based
automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning
patterns.

TL;DR: 本文提出了生成空间大小(GSS)的概念来解决LLMs在开放生成任务中的两个失败模式：创意任务输出过于同质化和事实任务产生多样化但错误的回答。作者构建了GSSBench评估套件，发现基于模型内部表示的EigenScore等幻觉检测指标优于传统多样性指标，并展示了GSS在检测提示歧义、解释推理模型行为以及引导模型扩展生成空间方面的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在开放生成任务中存在校准问题：对于创意任务输出过于同质化，对于事实任务则产生多样化但错误的回答。作者认为这两种失败模式都可以通过生成空间大小(GSS)的概念来统一理解和解决。

Method: 提出了生成空间大小(GSS)的概念，构建了GSSBench评估套件，包含具有真实GSS关系的提示对，用于评估不同指标并理解模型与期望行为的差异。特别关注基于模型内部表示的幻觉检测指标。

Result: 研究发现幻觉检测指标（特别是EigenScore）在仅使用模型内部表示的情况下，持续优于标准的多样性和不确定性量化指标，并能提供对模型内部任务表示的可解释性洞察。

Conclusion: GSS概念为理解和解决LLMs的校准问题提供了统一框架，在检测提示歧义、解释推理模型行为以及引导模型扩展生成空间方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output
diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to
overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but
incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes
are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective
generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model
considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with
ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where
models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection
metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity
and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,
providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.
We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and
predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting
overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to
expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了全模态细粒度感知，提出了Omni-Detective数据生成管道来减少幻觉，训练了Audio-Captioner和Omni-Captioner模型，并设计了Omni-Cloze评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前全模态语言模型在捕捉和描述细粒度细节方面的能力有限，且存在细节与幻觉共增长的问题，需要系统性的解决方案。

Method: 提出了Omni-Detective数据生成管道，集成工具调用来自主生成高质量多模态数据；基于此数据训练了音频专用的Audio-Captioner和音视频的Omni-Captioner模型；设计了Omni-Cloze填空式评估基准。

Result: Audio-Captioner在MMAU和MMAR上超越所有开源模型，性能媲美Gemini 2.5 Pro；Omni-Captioner在VDC上达到SOTA，在video-SALMONN 2上实现了细节与幻觉的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: Omni-Detective能有效生成高质量详细描述，Omni-Cloze为全模态细粒度感知提供了稳定可靠的评估方法，推动了多模态AI的发展。

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing
human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni
Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in
parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer
understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe
fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a
systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the
perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an
inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To
address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline
integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally
hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,
we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed
perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the
cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on
MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and
delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed
captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and
achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the
video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni
detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for
detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,
efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality
detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such
detailed captions.

TL;DR: 该研究扩展了语言模型对类型学合理语法偏好的研究，采用广义范畴语法构建更自然的人工语言，并测试模型对未见长句的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展先前关于语言模型归纳偏好的研究，从两个角度改进：采用更自然的人工语言形式化方法，以及更关注模型对长句的泛化能力。

Method: 使用广义范畴语法(GCG)构建人工语言，覆盖无界依赖和轻度上下文敏感结构等自然语言特征，并测试语言模型对未见长句的处理能力。

Result: 实验表明，类型学上合理的词序更容易让语言模型进行生产性泛化。

Conclusion: 语言模型确实具有偏好类型学合理语法结构的归纳偏差，这种偏好在其泛化能力中表现明显。

Abstract: Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically
frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been
investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell,
2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two
perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting
Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover
attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency
and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on
the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences.
Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental
paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders
tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

TL;DR: 提出DGRC方法，利用"议题性"概念评估语言模型对话自然度，发现模型偏好继续议题内容，指令微调增强此效应，但相关线索会降低此偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型对话自然度具有挑战性，因为"自然性"概念多变且缺乏可扩展的量化指标。

Method: 提出DGRC方法：将对话分割为提示，为子部分生成续写，重新组合对话和续写，比较重组序列的可能性。

Result: 语言模型偏好继续议题内容，指令微调模型此效应更强；当存在相关线索时，模型会降低议题偏好；指令微调不会进一步放大这种调节。

Conclusion: DGRC方法能减轻LM语言分析偏差，系统测试语篇敏感行为；模型对议题内容的偏好反映了成功对话动态的特征。

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not
trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics
remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to
assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,
Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)
generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue
and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined
sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and
enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we
find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect
enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference
when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although
instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects
a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前基于de Saussure和Chomsky理论对LLMs的语言学批评过于推测性和非建设性，需要更实用的评估框架。

Method: 采用Witold Mańczak的经验主义语言学框架，将语言定义为所有口头和书面表达的总和，并以使用频率为核心原则。

Result: 挑战了先前对LLMs的批评，为语言模型的设计、评估和解释提供了建设性指导。

Conclusion: 经验主义视角为理解LLMs提供了更实用和富有成效的框架，强调语言的实际使用模式而非理想化结构。

Abstract: Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical
frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive.
Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need
for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic
"competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the
empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical
linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational
system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above
all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as
language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior
critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating,
and interpreting language models.

TL;DR: Dr.LLM是一个动态层路由框架，通过轻量级路由器决定跳过、执行或重复transformer层，在保持或提高准确性的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM对所有token都经过所有transformer层，导致简单查询浪费计算资源，而复杂查询缺乏深度推理的灵活性。现有自适应深度方法存在推理时搜索成本高、需要架构修改或大规模重训练等问题，且往往牺牲准确性。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)推导高质量层配置，在计算预算下保持或提高准确性。采用窗口池化稳定路由、焦点损失与类别平衡、瓶颈MLP路由器等技术确保在类别不平衡和长序列下的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ARC和DART任务上，Dr.LLM准确率提升达+3.4%，平均每示例节省5层。路由器在领域外任务上仅损失0.85%准确率，同时保持效率，比现有路由方法性能提升达+7.7%。

Conclusion: Dr.LLM证明显式监督的路由器可以在不改变基础权重的情况下，为冻结的LLM提供预算感知、准确性驱动的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a
transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and
insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning.
Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on
costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining,
and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce
Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that
equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip,
execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision:
using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer
configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our
design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing,
and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long
sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to
+3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to
out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA,
AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and
outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that
explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware,
accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

This paper investigates the time and complexity required to produce
high-quality annotated speech data for a subset of low-resource languages, low

hours of Bambara voice data. We report that it takes, on average, 30 hours of
human labor to accurately transcribe one hour of speech data under laboratory
conditions and 36 hours under field conditions. The study provides a baseline

Conclusion: 为在社会科学实验中应用大型语言模型提供了操作评估指标和理论基础，解决了传统方法在捕捉LLM改进趋势方面的局限性。

Abstract: This research focuses on using large language models (LLMs) to simulate
social experiments, exploring their ability to emulate human personality in
virtual persona role-playing. The research develops an end-to-end evaluation
framework, including individual-level analysis of stability and
identifiability, as well as population-level analysis called progressive
personality curves to examine the veracity and consistency of LLMs in
simulating human personality. Methodologically, this research proposes
important modifications to traditional psychometric approaches (CFA and
construct validity) which are unable to capture improvement trends in LLMs at
their current low-level simulation, potentially leading to remature rejection
or methodological misalignment. The main contributions of this research are:
proposing a systematic framework for LLM virtual personality evaluation;
empirically demonstrating the critical role of persona detail in personality
simulation quality; and identifying marginal utility effects of persona
profiles, especially a Scaling Law in LLM personality simulation, offering
operational evaluation metrics and a theoretical foundation for applying large
language models in social science experiments.

Abstract: As Large Language Models increasingly mediate human communication and
decision-making, understanding their value expression becomes critical for
research across disciplines. This work presents the Ethics Engine, a modular
Python pipeline that transforms psychometric assessment of LLMs from a
technically complex endeavor into an accessible research tool. The pipeline
demonstrates how thoughtful infrastructure design can expand participation in
AI research, enabling investigators across cognitive science, political
psychology, education, and other fields to study value expression in language
models. Recent adoption by University of Edinburgh researchers studying
authoritarianism validates its research utility, processing over 10,000 AI
responses across multiple models and contexts. We argue that such tools
fundamentally change the landscape of AI research by lowering technical
barriers while maintaining scientific rigor. As LLMs increasingly serve as
cognitive infrastructure, their embedded values shape millions of daily
interactions. Without systematic measurement of these value expressions, we
deploy systems whose moral influence remains uncharted. The Ethics Engine
enables the rigorous assessment necessary for informed governance of these
influential technologies.

limitations, we therefore performed an experimental study that combines
different GenAI approaches. Language models were used to automatically
translate and analyze the contents of each program, deriving five potential
visual appearance changes to the city of Dortmund. Based on each analysis, we
then generated images with diffusion models and published all results as an
interactive webpage. All GenAI models were locally deployed on a Dortmund-based

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving educational landscape, the integration of technology
has shifted from an enhancement to a cornerstone of educational strategy
worldwide. This transition is propelled by advancements in digital technology,
especially the emergence of artificial intelligence as a crucial tool in
learning environments. This research project critically evaluates the impact of
three distinct educational settings: traditional educational methods without
technological integration, those enhanced by non-AI technology, and those
utilising AI-driven technologies. This comparison aims to assess how each
environment influences educational outcomes, engagement, pedagogical methods,
and equity in access to learning resources, and how each contributes uniquely
to the learning experience. The ultimate goal of this research is to synthesise
the strengths of each model to create a more holistic educational approach. By
integrating the personal interaction and tested pedagogical techniques of
traditional classrooms, the enhanced accessibility and collaborative tools
offered by non-AI technology, and the personalised, adaptive learning
strategies enabled by AI-driven technologies, education systems can develop
richer, more effective learning environments. This hybrid approach aims to
leverage the best elements of each setting, thereby enhancing educational
outcomes, engagement, and inclusiveness, while also addressing the distinct
challenges and limitations inherent in each model. The intention is to create
an educational framework deeply attentive to the diverse needs of students,
ensuring equitable access to high-quality education for all.

TL;DR: 比较中国和北美兽医专业人员对AI的认知、采用和应用情况，发现存在"采用悖论"：中国采用率高但熟悉度低，主要用于临床诊断；北美熟悉度高但采用率低，主要用于行政任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同地区兽医专业人员对AI的采用模式是否受区域市场和人口因素影响，测试假设认为采用模式由这些因素塑造。

Method: 采用描述性横断面调查，在中国调查455名兽医专业人员（2025年5-7月），并与北美2024年调查的3,968名兽医专业人员数据进行比较。

Result: 中国兽医AI采用率71.0%但熟悉度仅55.4%，主要用于疾病诊断(50.1%)和处方计算(44.8%)；北美兽医熟悉度83.8%但采用率39.2%，主要用于影像分析(39.0%)和记录保存(39.0%)。

Conclusion: 不同地区存在不同的AI采用模式：中国是自下而上的临床效能增强模式，北美是自上而下的行政效率提升模式，需要针对特定区域的定制化AI整合策略。

Abstract: This study compares the perception, adoption, and application of artificial
intelligence (AI) among veterinary professionals in China and North America
(NA), testing the hypothesis that adoption patterns are shaped by regional
market and demographic factors. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was
conducted with 455 veterinary professionals in China between May and July 2025.
The results were compared with published data from a 2024 survey of 3,968
veterinary professionals in the United States and Canada. The Chinese cohort,
primarily composed of clinicians (81.5%), showed a high AI adoption rate
(71.0%) despite low familiarity (55.4%). Their AI use was focused on clinical
tasks, such as disease diagnosis (50.1%) and prescription calculation (44.8%).
In contrast, the NA cohort reported high familiarity (83.8%) but a lower
adoption rate (39.2%). Their priorities were administrative, including imaging
analysis (39.0%) and record-keeping (39.0%). Concerns about AI reliability and
accuracy were the top barrier in both groups. Our findings reveal an "adoption
paradox" where the Chinese market demonstrates a practitioner-driven, bottom-up
adoption model focused on augmenting clinical efficacy, while the NA market
shows a more cautious, structured, top-down integration aimed at improving
administrative efficiency. This suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to
AI development and integration is insufficient, and tailored, region-specific
strategies are necessary to responsibly incorporate AI into global veterinary

### [68] [From Delegates to Trustees: How Optimizing for Long-Term Interests Shapes Bias and Alignment in LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12689)
*Suyash Fulay,Jocelyn Zhu,Michiel Bakker*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了AI系统在代表人类利益时作为代理人（镜像表达偏好）还是受托人（基于长期利益判断）的设计权衡，通过模拟美国政策投票实验发现受托人模型在明确问题上更符合专家共识，但在主观议题上存在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注行为克隆，即模型如何复制个体表达偏好，但忽略了AI系统应作为代理人还是受托人的设计权衡，这关系到LLM的谄媚性问题。

Method: 通过在美国背景下模拟各种政策议题的投票实验，应用时间效用框架权衡短期和长期利益（模拟受托人角色），并与行为克隆模型（模拟代理人）的投票结果进行比较。

Result: 偏向长期利益的受托人式预测在明确问题上产生更符合专家共识的政策决策，但在缺乏明确共识的话题上显示出对模型默认立场的更大偏见。

Conclusion: AI系统代表人类利益存在根本权衡：代理人模型更好地保护用户自主权但可能偏离有充分支持的政策立场，而受托人模型能在明确问题上促进福利但面临家长式作风和主观议题偏见风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising accuracy in predicting
survey responses and policy preferences, which has increased interest in their
potential to represent human interests in various domains. Most existing
research has focused on behavioral cloning, effectively evaluating how well
models reproduce individuals' expressed preferences. Drawing on theories of
political representation, we highlight an underexplored design trade-off:
whether AI systems should act as delegates, mirroring expressed preferences, or
as trustees, exercising judgment about what best serves an individual's
interests. This trade-off is closely related to issues of LLM sycophancy, where
models can encourage behavior or validate beliefs that may be aligned with a
user's short-term preferences, but is detrimental to their long-term interests.
Through a series of experiments simulating votes on various policy issues in
the U.S. context, we apply a temporal utility framework that weighs short and
long-term interests (simulating a trustee role) and compare voting outcomes to
behavior-cloning models (simulating a delegate). We find that trustee-style
predictions weighted toward long-term interests produce policy decisions that
align more closely with expert consensus on well-understood issues, but also
show greater bias toward models' default stances on topics lacking clear
agreement. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off in designing AI
systems to represent human interests. Delegate models better preserve user
autonomy but may diverge from well-supported policy positions, while trustee
models can promote welfare on well-understood issues yet risk paternalism and
bias on subjective topics.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a framework for deception in quantum games,
extending the Honey-X paradigm from classical zero-sum settings into the
quantum domain. Building on a view of deception in classical games as
manipulation of a player's perception of the payoff matrix, we formalize
quantum deception as controlled perturbations of the payoff Hamiltonian subject
to a deception budget. We show that when victims are aware of possible
deception, their equilibrium strategies surprisingly coincide with those of
naive victims who fully trust the deceptive Hamiltonian. This equivalence
allows us to cast quantum deception as a bilevel optimization problem, which
can be reformulated into a bilinear semidefinite program. To illustrate the
framework, we present simulations on quantum versions of the Penny Flip game,
demonstrating how quantum strategy spaces and non-classical payoffs can amplify
the impact of deception relative to classical formulations.

Abstract: The most startling of the contemporary problems is the sleepiness of
chauffeur which causes lots of car accidents. Prevention of those impending
accidents by detecting and alerting the sleepy chauffeur is vital, otherwise
that would lead to loss of lives and various traumas along with severe
injuries. The slumber or sleep may be caused by huge stress, pressure,
relentless work load or alcoholism, for which sleep deprivation occurs and the
chauffeur while driving gets drowsy. So far, considerable amount of systems has

image processing algorithms using cameras. Some of them also incorporate
artificial intelligence and machine learning based algorithms. This paper
presents a review of the existing systems and also proposes an easy and cheap
system using sensors and Arduino, capable of detecting sleepiness and generates
siren alarm and send alert message to take precautionary measures.

Result: 通过四个案例研究证明该方法能有效激励终端产消者参与市场，同时确保其行为不会对电网运行产生不利影响。

Conclusion: 基于概率位置边际定价的本地电力市场框架能够有效处理可再生能源不确定性，为大规模可再生能源整合提供关键支持。

Abstract: Since the 1990s, widespread introduction of central (wholesale) electricity
markets has been seen across multiple continents, driven by the search for
efficient operation of the power grid through competition. The increase of
renewables has made significant impacts both on central electricity markets and
distribution-level grids as renewable power generation is often connected to
the latter. These stochastic renewable technologies have both advantages and
disadvantages. On one hand they offer very low marginal cost and carbon
emissions, while on the other hand, their output is uncertain, requiring
flexible backup power with high marginal cost. Flexibility from end-prosumers
or smaller market participants is therefore seen as a key enabler of
large-scale integration of renewables. However, current central electricity
markets do not directly include uncertainty into the market clearing and do not
account for physical constraints of distribution grids. In this paper we
propose a local electricity market framework based on probabilistic locational
marginal pricing, effectively accounting for uncertainties in production,
consumption and grid variables. The model includes a representation of the grid
using the lindistflow equations and accounts for the propagation of uncertainty
using general Polynomial Chaos (gPC). A two-stage convex model is proposed; in
the day-ahead stage, probability distributions of prices are calculated for
every timestep, where the expected values represent the day-ahead (spot)
prices. In the real-time stage, uncertainties are realized (measured) and a
trivial calculation reveals the real-time price. Through four instructive
case-studies we highlight the effectiveness of the method to incentivize
end-prosumers' participation in the market, while ensuring that their behavior
does not have an adverse impact on the operation of the grid.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种物理信息强化学习算法PI-TD3，将可微分潮流模型和基于电压的奖励设计集成到TD3算法中，实现电动汽车在满足用户需求的同时提供实时电压支撑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车虽然为电网服务提供了灵活性，但大规模无序充电会威胁配电网电压稳定性。现有强化学习方法往往忽视物理电网约束或在复杂大规模任务中性能有限，限制了其可扩展性和实际应用性。

Method: 将可微分潮流模型和基于电压的奖励设计集成到TD3算法中，形成PI-TD3算法。该方法考虑了物理电网约束，能够处理不确定和过载条件下的电压调节。

Result: 在IEEE 34总线和123总线网络上的基准测试表明，PI-TD3在电网约束管理、用户满意度和经济指标方面优于无模型强化学习和基于优化的基准方法，即使系统扩展到数百辆电动汽车时仍能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: PI-TD3算法实现了更快收敛、改进的样本效率和可靠的电压幅值调节，为增强电网韧性和支持配电网运行提供了鲁棒、可扩展且实用的电动汽车充电策略。

Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) offer substantial flexibility for grid services, yet
large-scale, uncoordinated charging can threaten voltage stability in
distribution networks. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for
smart charging often disregard physical grid constraints or have limited
performance for complex large-scale tasks, limiting their scalability and
real-world applicability. This paper introduces a physics-informed (PI) RL
algorithm that integrates a differentiable power flow model and voltage-based
reward design into the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)
algorithm, enabling EVs to deliver real-time voltage support while meeting user
demands. The resulting PI-TD3 algorithm achieves faster convergence, improved
sample efficiency, and reliable voltage magnitude regulation under uncertain
and overloaded conditions. Benchmarks on the IEEE 34-bus and 123-bus networks
show that the proposed PI-TD3 outperforms both model-free RL and
optimization-based baselines in grid constraint management, user satisfaction,
and economic metrics, even as the system scales to hundreds of EVs. These
advances enable robust, scalable, and practical EV charging strategies that
enhance grid resilience and support distribution networks operation.

TL;DR: 提出一种非参数频域方法，用于在宽频带内识别小信号dq不对称电网阻抗，使用电网连接变流器实现超快速识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有识别方法面临显著权衡：被动方法依赖环境谐波和罕见电网事件，只能在少数频率提供估计；主动方法需要长时间序列测量和专用设备。时间域方法虽减少测量时间，但需要简化假设或繁琐的模型阶数调整。

Method: 非参数频域方法，无需专用激励信号或硬件，实现超快速（<1秒）识别，大幅减少测量时间。该方法不对电网结构做任何假设。

Result: 通过详细电磁暂态仿真验证该方法，并证明其相对于现有替代方案的明显优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有电网阻抗识别方法的挑战，实现了快速、准确且无需专用设备的阻抗识别。

Abstract: We propose a non-parametric frequency-domain method to identify small-signal
$dq$-asymmetric grid impedances, over a wide frequency band, using
grid-connected converters. Existing identification methods are faced with
significant trade-offs: e.g., passive approaches rely on ambient harmonics and
rare grid events and thus can only provide estimates at a few frequencies,
while many active approaches that intentionally perturb grid operation require
long time series measurement and specialized equipment. Although active
time-domain methods reduce the measurement time, they either make crude
simplifying assumptions or require laborious model order tuning. Our approach
effectively addresses these challenges: it does not require specialized
excitation signals or hardware and achieves ultrafast ($<1$ s) identification,
drastically reducing measurement time. Being non-parametric, our approach also
makes no assumptions on the grid structure. A detailed electromagnetic
transient simulation is used to validate the method and demonstrate its clear
superiority over existing alternatives.

Abstract: This paper proposes a unidirectionally connected fully actuated system
(UC-FAS) approach for the sub-stabilization and tracking control of 6-DOF
quadrotors, tackling limitations both in state-space and FAS framework to some
extent. The framework systematically converts underactuated quadrotor dynamics
into a UC-FAS model, unifying the existing different FAS transformation ways.
By eliminating estimation of the high-order derivatives of control inputs, a
drawback of current methods, the UC-FAS model simplifies controller design and
enables direct eigenstructure assignment for closed-loop dynamics. Simulations
demonstrate precise 6-DOF tracking performance. This work bridges theoretical
FAS approach advancements with practical implementation needs, offering a
standardized paradigm for nonlinear quadrotor control.

Abstract: Wind power producers can benefit from forming coalitions to participate
cooperatively in electricity markets. To support such collaboration, various
profit allocation rules rooted in cooperative game theory have been proposed.
However, existing approaches overlook the lack of coherence among producers
regarding forecast information, which may lead to ambiguity in offering and
allocations. In this paper, we introduce a ``reconcile-then-optimize''
framework for cooperative market offerings. This framework first aligns the
individual forecasts into a coherent joint forecast before determining market
offers. With such forecasts, we formulate and solve a two-stage stochastic
programming problem to derive both the aggregate offer and the corresponding
scenario-based dual values for each trading hour. Based on these dual values,
we construct a profit allocation rule that is budget-balanced and stable.
Finally, we validate the proposed method through empirical case studies,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness and theoretical soundness.

Conclusion: 提出的dSB硬件架构在低端FPGA上成功实现了256变量组合优化问题的求解，证明了该方法的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems exhibit exponential complexity,
making their resolution challenging. Simulated Adiabatic Bifurcation (aSB) is a
quantum-inspired algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to largescale CO
problems written in the Ising form. It explores the solution space by emulating
the adiabatic evolution of a network of Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators
(KPOs), where each oscillator represents a variable in the problem. The optimal
solution corresponds to the ground state of this system. A key advantage of
this approach is the possibility of updating multiple variables simultaneously,
making it particularly suited for hardware implementation. To enhance solution
quality and convergence speed, variations of the algorithm have been proposed
in the literature, including ballistic (bSB), discrete (dSB), and thermal
(HbSB) versions. In this work, we have comprehensively analyzed dSB, bSB, and
HbSB using dedicated software models, evaluating the feasibility of using a
fixed-point representation for hardware implementation. We then present an
opensource hardware architecture implementing the dSB algorithm for
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The design allows users to adjust the
degree of algorithmic parallelization based on their specific requirements. A
proof-of-concept implementation that solves 256-variable problems was achieved
on an AMD Kria KV260 SoM, a low-tier FPGA, validated using well-known max-cut
and knapsack problems.

Motivation: 在农村地区，路边单元稀疏且功率受限或离网，需要在保证安全的同时考虑能源效率。

Method: 通过分析三个通信控制因素（子载波间距、调制编码方案、发射功率）在不同交通场景下对包接收率和最小通信距离的影响。

Result: 在重交通场景下，增加发射功率并选择低速率调制编码方案可维持高包接收率但能耗较高；在轻交通场景下，保持较低发射功率和低调制编码方案可实现良好的可靠性-能耗权衡。

Conclusion: 需要采用自适应、能量感知的策略来保证农村V2X系统的安全性和能源效率。

Abstract: Connected braking can reduce fatal collisions in connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) by using reliable, low-latency 5G New Radio (NR) links,
especially NR Sidelink Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). In rural areas, road side
units are sparse and power-constrained or off-grid, so energy efficiency must
be considered alongside safety. This paper studies how three communication
control factors including subcarrier spacing ($\mathrm{SCS}$), modulation and
coding scheme ($\mathrm{MCS}$), and transmit power ($P_{\mathrm{t}}$) should be
configured to balance safety and energy consumption in rural line-of-sight
(LOS) scenarios in light and heavy traffic scenarios. Safety is quantified by
the packet receive ratio ($\mathrm{PRR}$) against the minimum communication
distance $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$, defined as the distance that the vehicle travels
during the transmission of the safety message. Results show that, under heavy
traffic, increasing $P_{\mathrm{t}}$ and selecting a low-rate $\mathrm{MCS}$ at
$\mathrm{SCS} = 30$ kHz sustains high $\mathrm{PRR}$ at $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$,
albeit with higher energy cost. In light traffic, maintaining lower
$P_\mathrm{t}$ with low $\mathrm{MCS}$ levels achieves a favorable
reliability-energy trade-off while preserving acceptable $\mathrm{PRR}$ at
$D_{\mathrm{comm}}$. These findings demonstrate the necessity of adaptive,
energy-aware strategy to guarantee both safety and energy efficiency in rural
V2X systems.

Motivation: 解决分布式估计中观测数据隐私保护和有限数据率通信之间的矛盾，需要在保护敏感信息的同时减少通信开销。

Method: 采用二值量化器设计隐私保护分布式估计算法，通过时变隐私噪声和步长的协同设计，使Fisher信息矩阵关于敏感信息以多项式速率收敛到零。

Result: 算法估计值几乎必然收敛到真实参数，获得多项式收敛速率，并建立了隐私保护与收敛速率之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 该算法成功实现了隐私保护与通信成本的平衡，量化器带来的隐私改善具有乘法效应，数值实验验证了主要结果。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving distributed estimation problem
with a limited data rate, where the observations are the sensitive information.
Specifically, a binary-valued quantizer-based privacy-preserving distributed
estimation algorithm is developed, which improves the algorithm's
privacy-preserving capability and simultaneously reduces the communication
costs. The algorithm's privacy-preserving capability, measured by the Fisher
information matrix, is dynamically enhanced over time. Notably, the Fisher
information matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive
information converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in
privacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a
multiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits
only 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally,
the assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is
not required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and
reducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge
almost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a
co-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes. A
polynomial almost sure convergence rate is obtained, and then the trade-off
between privacy and convergence rate is established. Numerical examples
demonstrate the main results.

Abstract: In the transition toward a sustainable power system, renewable-based Virtual
Power Plants (RVPPs) have emerged as a promising solution to the challenges of
integrating renewable energy sources into electricity markets. Their viability,
however, depends on effective market participation strategies and the ability
to manage uncertainties while leveraging flexible resources. This paper
analyzes the impact of different flexible resources - such as concentrated
solar power plants, hydro plants, biomass plants, and flexible demand - on the
participation of RVPPs in energy and reserve markets. Multiple sources of
uncertainty in generation, consumption, and electricity prices are addressed
using a two-stage robust optimization approach. The contribution of different
technologies to RVPP profitability is evaluated through a marginal contribution
method, ensuring fair allocation of profits among them according to their
actual role in energy and reserve provision across markets. Simulations for an
RVPP in southern Spain demonstrate how strategic decisions and the availability
of flexible resources influence viability, market participation, and unit
scheduling.

Abstract: This paper studies variance estimators in panel data settings. There has been
a recent surge in research on panel data models with a number of new estimators
proposed. However, there has been less attention paid to the quantification of
the precision of these estimators. Of the variance estimators that have been
proposed, their relative merits are not well understood. In this paper we
develop a common framework for comparing some of the proposed variance
estimators for generic point estimators. We reinterpret three commonly used
approaches as targeting different conditional variances under an
exchangeability assumption. We find that the estimators we consider are all
valid on average, but that their performance in terms of power differs
substantially depending on the heteroskedasticity structure of the data.
Building on these insights, we propose a new variance estimator that flexibly
accounts for heteroskedasticity in both the unit and time dimensions, and
delivers superior statistical power in realistic panel data settings.

Abstract: We leverage an ensemble of many regressors, the number of which can exceed
the sample size, for economic prediction. An underlying latent factor structure
implies a dense regression model with highly correlated covariates. We propose
the L2-relaxation method for estimating the regression coefficients and
extrapolating the out-of-sample (OOS) outcomes. This framework can be applied
to policy evaluation using the panel data approach (PDA), where we further
establish inference for the average treatment effect. In addition, we extend
the traditional single unit setting in PDA to allow for many treated units with
a short post-treatment period. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that our
approach exhibits excellent finite sample performance for both OOS prediction
and policy evaluation. We illustrate our method with two empirical examples:
(i) predicting China's producer price index growth rate and evaluating the
effect of real estate regulations, and (ii) estimating the impact of Brexit on
the stock returns of British and European companies.

Abstract: We develop a class of optimal tests for a structural break occurring at an
unknown date in infinite and growing-order time series regression models, such
as AR($\infty$), linear regression with increasingly many covariates, and
nonparametric regression. Under an auxiliary i.i.d. Gaussian error assumption,
we derive an average power optimal test, establishing a growing-dimensional
analog of the exponential tests of Andrews and Ploberger (1994) to handle
identification failure under the null hypothesis of no break. Relaxing the
i.i.d. Gaussian assumption to a more general dependence structure, we establish
a functional central limit theorem for the underlying stochastic processes,
which features an extra high-order serial dependence term due to the growing
dimension. We robustify our test both against this term and finite sample bias
and illustrate its excellent performance and practical relevance in a Monte
Carlo study and a real data empirical example.

### [83] [Nonparametric Identification and Estimation of Spatial Treatment Effect Boundaries: Evidence from 42 Million Pollution Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12289)
*Tatsuru Kikuchi*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 开发非参数框架识别和估计地理溢出效应中的空间边界，使用4200万卫星NO₂观测数据，发现核回归比参数化指数衰减假设平均减少1.0个百分点预测误差，在政策相关距离改善最大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气扩散理论预测的理想化指数衰减假设（稳定风场、均匀大气、平坦地形）在实践中系统性地被违反，需要更灵活的方法来准确估计污染物的空间边界。

Method: 建立弱平滑性和单调性条件下的非参数识别，提出基于核的估计器与数据驱动带宽选择，推导渐近理论进行统计推断。

Result: 非参数核回归相比参数化指数衰减平均减少1.0个百分点预测误差，在10公里处改善2.8个百分点（近源影响），在100公里处改善3.7个百分点（长距离传输）。参数方法系统性地低估近源浓度而高估长距离衰减。

Conclusion: 灵活的数据驱动空间方法在环境政策应用中显著优于限制性参数假设，COVID-19自然实验验证了框架的时间敏感性。

Abstract: This paper develops a nonparametric framework for identifying and estimating
spatial boundaries of treatment effects in settings with geographic spillovers.
While atmospheric dispersion theory predicts exponential decay of pollution
under idealized assumptions, these assumptions -- steady winds, homogeneous
atmospheres, flat terrain -- are systematically violated in practice. I
establish nonparametric identification of spatial boundaries under weak
smoothness and monotonicity conditions, propose a kernel-based estimator with
data-driven bandwidth selection, and derive asymptotic theory for inference.
Using 42 million satellite observations of NO$_2$ concentrations near coal
plants (2019-2021), I find that nonparametric kernel regression reduces
prediction errors by 1.0 percentage point on average compared to parametric
exponential decay assumptions, with largest improvements at policy-relevant
distances: 2.8 percentage points at 10 km (near-source impacts) and 3.7
percentage points at 100 km (long-range transport). Parametric methods
systematically underestimate near-source concentrations while overestimating
long-range decay. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a natural experiment
validating the framework's temporal sensitivity: NO$_2$ concentrations dropped
4.6\% in 2020, then recovered 5.7\% in 2021. These results demonstrate that
flexible, data-driven spatial methods substantially outperform restrictive
parametric assumptions in environmental policy applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了软约束薛定谔桥问题（SCSBP），通过用惩罚函数替代硬终端约束来解决经典薛定谔桥问题在实践中的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典薛定谔桥问题在实现中强制执行硬终端约束，导致在高维或数据稀缺情况下不稳定。需要一种更灵活的方法来改善生成式AI的稳健性。

Method: 采用软约束薛定谔桥问题框架，将终端约束替换为一般惩罚函数，形成更灵活的McKean-Vlasov型随机控制公式。

Result: 建立了所有惩罚水平下最优解的存在性，并证明当惩罚增加时，控制和价值函数以线性速率收敛到经典薛定谔桥问题的解。

Conclusion: 软约束方法不仅提供了定量收敛保证，还揭示了惩罚正则化如何实现稳健的生成建模、微调和迁移学习。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor是一个用于ICU死亡率预测的框架，通过原型学习实现内在可解释性，整合了临床病程识别、人口统计学异质性和预后意识三个关键决策要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU死亡率预测不仅需要预测准确性，还需要可解释性来建立临床信任。现有方法主要关注人口统计学异质性，忽视了临床病程识别和预后意识。

Method: ProtoDoctor包含两个创新模块：预后临床病程识别模块（通过原型学习识别临床病程，使用新的正则化机制实现预后意识）和人口统计学异质性识别模块（通过队列特定原型和风险调整建模异质性）。

Result: 广泛的实证评估表明ProtoDoctor在预测准确性上优于最先进的基线方法。人工评估进一步证实其解释在临床实践中更具意义、可信度和适用性。

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor成功整合了ICU决策实践的三个关键要素，在保持高预测准确性的同时提供了临床上有意义的解释，适用于ICU实践。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

TL;DR: 提出GAR框架，通过生成对抗强化学习联合训练问题生成器和求解器，实现隐式课程学习，提高数学定理证明的训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于固定问题集的强化学习方法训练效率低，难以处理复杂问题，需要更有效的训练框架。

Method: GAR框架：在对抗循环中联合训练问题生成器和求解器，通过隐式课程学习机制使任务难度与证明者能力对齐。

Result: 在MiniF2F-Test基准上平均相对提升4.20%，在ProofNet-Test上pass@32从22.58%提升至25.81%。

Conclusion: GAR建立了可验证环境下问题生成与求解协同进化的一般强化学习范式。

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

TL;DR: Janus框架通过联合使用欧几里得和双曲图神经网络来检测节点级异常，利用对比学习对齐不同几何空间的嵌入，有效识别图中复杂异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 节点级异常检测面临结构模式和特征分布多样性的挑战，在欺诈检测、网络安全和推荐系统等应用中至关重要。

Method: 每个节点由原始特征和结构特征（随机游走和度）组成两个视图，分别嵌入欧几里得和双曲空间。使用多图自编码器框架，通过对比学习目标作为正则化项来对齐嵌入。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，Janus始终优于浅层和深层基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合多种几何表示提供了识别图中细微复杂异常的稳健有效方法。

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的无梯度方法，仅使用中间检查点的损失值来估计训练数据对模型预测的影响，解决了现有方法在大模型上计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解训练数据如何影响机器学习模型预测行为至关重要，但现有影响估计方法在大模型上存在精度低或计算成本过高的问题。

Method: 使用零阶近似方法，仅依赖训练和测试数据在中间检查点上的损失值以及检查点本身，无需梯度或逆Hessian计算。

Result: 该方法在计算效率和内存占用上显著优于现有方法，在自影响估计上精度更高，在训练-测试影响估计上精度相当或更好。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模语言模型的训练数据分析提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案，即使对于不可微损失函数也适用。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了Boundary Guidance方法，通过强化学习微调生成模型，使其远离安全分类器的决策边界，从而同时提高输出的安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过微调生成模型来降低被安全分类器过滤的概率，但这往往使模型产生靠近分类器决策边界的样本，增加了假阳性和假阴性错误。

Method: 使用强化学习进行微调，明确引导生成远离分类器的边界区域。

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示的基准测试中，Boundary Guidance提高了输出的安全性和实用性，LLM-as-a-Judge评估证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模和奖励设计下都表现出鲁棒性，为生成模型的安全优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

TL;DR: WaveletDiff是一个新颖的扩散模型框架，通过在小波系数上训练来生成高质量的时间序列数据，解决了现有方法在时域或频域单一建模的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中时间序列数据稀缺，现有生成模型难以捕捉时间序列固有的多尺度结构，需要一种能够同时建模时域和频域特征的方法。

Method: 使用小波变换将时间序列分解到多分辨率结构，为每个分解层级训练专用transformer，并通过跨层级注意力机制实现时频尺度间的选择性信息交换，同时基于Parseval定理加入能量保持约束。

Result: 在能源、金融和神经科学等6个真实数据集上的测试表明，WaveletDiff在5个不同性能指标上始终优于最先进的时域和频域生成方法，判别分数和Context-FID分数平均比次优基线小3倍。

Conclusion: WaveletDiff通过在小波域训练扩散模型，有效捕捉时间序列的多尺度结构，在生成质量和频谱保真度方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Motivation: 语言模型在适应新任务时面临基本权衡：既要学习新能力，又要避免对现有知识的灾难性遗忘。现有研究对计算约束下平衡任务性能和知识保留的最优回放比例理解不足。

Method: 使用bAbI推理任务作为目标，应用合成数据生成技术，系统评估不同总token预算和回放比例配置，分析它们对任务掌握和通用知识保留的影响。

Conclusion: 提供了基于实证的回放比例选择指南，使实践者能够以显著降低的训练成本实现强大的任务适应能力。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Result: 当前模型在二元讽刺检测方面取得中等成功，但在生成高质量解释方面表现不足，需要任务特定微调。

Conclusion: 开源VLMs在多模态讽刺检测方面有潜力，但在解释生成能力上仍需改进，需要进一步的任务特定优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测性过程监控对主动决策至关重要，而过程通常是资源驱动的，因此理解和纳入参与者行为在预测中很关键。现有研究虽然纳入了参与者行为的某些方面，但将其作为时变信号在预测性过程监控中的作用仍然有限。

Method: 使用真实事件日志构建多变量时间序列，包括吞吐时间以及参与者参与度、继续、中断和交接行为的频率和持续时间等参与者中心特征。训练和比较多个模型来研究添加参与者行为的好处。

Result: 结果显示，在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上，加入参与者行为信息的模型始终优于仅包含吞吐时间特征的基线模型。

Conclusion: 将参与者行为随时间建模并纳入预测模型能够提高性能指标预测的效果。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成显式负向陈述的知识嵌入学习方法，通过双模型架构分别训练正向和负向陈述，在训练过程中相互生成负样本，显著提升了链接预测和三元组分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图嵌入方法大多依赖封闭世界假设，将缺失三元组视为假，这与现实世界知识图的开放世界假设不符。显式负向陈述有助于区分假三元组和未知三元组，但很少被包含在知识图中且常被忽略。

Method: 采用双模型架构，两个嵌入模型并行训练：一个在正向陈述上训练，另一个在负向陈述上训练。训练时，每个模型通过破坏正样本并选择另一个模型评分最高的候选作为负样本来生成负样本。

Result: 在通用和领域特定知识图上的广泛实验表明，该方法在链接预测和三元组分类任务上优于最先进的嵌入模型，证明了将有意义负向知识集成到嵌入学习中的价值。

Conclusion: 集成显式负向陈述的知识嵌入学习方法能够有效提升预测性能，为知识图嵌入学习提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在序列决策中的应用日益增多，但基于序列建模的强化学习方法在对抗鲁棒性方面尚未充分探索，需要解决决策变换器在对抗性环境中的脆弱性问题。

Method: 将每个阶段的交互建模为阶段博弈，定义基于后续状态期望最大值的收益函数，通过条件化Transformer策略于阶段博弈的NashQ值，生成鲁棒且保守的策略。

Result: CART在对抗性随机游戏中实现了更准确的极小极大值估计，并在各种环境下持续获得更优的最坏情况回报。

Conclusion: CART框架成功提升了决策变换器在对抗性环境中的鲁棒性，通过阶段博弈建模和NashQ值条件化，实现了对抗鲁棒性和保守性的平衡。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

Method: 采用双层次优化：下层在固定秩约束下优化策略，从Wasserstein球中采样动态；上层自适应调整秩以平衡偏差-方差权衡，将策略参数投影到低秩流形。

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制基准测试中，AdaRL优于固定秩基线和最先进鲁棒RL方法，并能收敛到任务的内在秩。

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为模型不确定性下的鲁棒强化学习提供了高效且原则性的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架，将个人事件和关系事件结合建模，并发布了相关数据集，证明同时考虑两种事件类型能提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将个人事件和关系事件分开建模，但现实系统中需要同时捕捉这两种事件类型，缺乏统一的建模方法和公开数据集。

Method: 引入包含个人和关系事件的数据集集合，提出统一的形式化方法，并实证验证模型能从结合两种事件类型中获益。

Result: 实验结果表明，同时考虑个人和关系事件能提升模型性能，但现有方法仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: 发布了数据集和资源以支持统一用户事件建模的进一步研究，鼓励该方向的发展。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

TL;DR: 提出VMoGE方法，通过变分图神经网络专家模型整合频段特异性生物标志物识别和结构化变分推理，显著提升痴呆症亚型和严重程度分期的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆等痴呆症在EEG中表现出重叠的电生理特征，现有基于EEG的方法受限于全频段分析，难以精确区分痴呆亚型和严重程度阶段。

Method: VMoGE采用多粒度transformer提取四个频段的多尺度时间模式，然后使用高斯马尔可夫随机场先验的变分图卷积编码器，通过结构化变分推理和自适应门控将神经专业化与生理学意义的EEG频段联系起来。

Result: 在两个不同数据集上的评估显示，VMoGE在亚型分类和严重程度分期任务中表现优异，AUC比最先进方法提高4%到10%。

Conclusion: VMoGE不仅提供卓越的诊断性能，还通过专家权重和空间模式提供可解释的见解，有助于EEG生物标志物发现，支持全面的痴呆症诊断和监测。

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 是一种简单的一行代码修改，仅在参数坐标符号与优化器更新一致时应用权重衰减，无需额外超参数即可提升语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解耦衰减隐式优化正则化或约束目标，而CWD旨在保持原始损失函数不变，在达到平稳流形时诱导滑动模式行为，寻找未修改目标的局部帕累托最优平稳点。

Method: CWD是一种优化器无关的修改，仅对符号与优化器更新对齐的参数坐标应用权重衰减，可作为AdamW、Lion和Muon等优化器的即插即用替换。

Result: 在语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务中，CWD在百万到十亿参数规模上持续改善最终损失和准确率。

Conclusion: CWD是一种简单有效的权重衰减改进方法，无需额外调参即可在各种优化器和任务中提升性能。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

TL;DR: Locaris是一个基于解码器大语言模型的室内定位系统，将Wi-Fi接入点测量作为token处理，无需预处理即可直接处理原始Wi-Fi遥测数据，实现轻量级且可泛化的室内定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统室内Wi-Fi定位方法对环境动态、信道传播特性和硬件异构性高度敏感，需要大量人工校准且性能容易退化。

Method: 通过在不同Wi-Fi数据集上微调LLM，将每个接入点测量视为token，直接从原始信号学习到设备位置的映射。

Result: 实验表明Locaris在各种遥测类型上匹配或超越现有技术，仅用几百个样本即可达到亚米级精度，在缺失AP情况下仍保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 紧凑型LLM可作为免校准回归模型用于室内定位，在大规模部署中提供可扩展和稳健的跨环境性能。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决Impagliazzo等人提出的可复现性定义下的统计聚类问题，即算法在不同输入但相同分布的数据上运行时，在共享内部随机性的情况下能产生相同分区的需求。

Method: 使用组合优化问题近似算法作为黑盒，设计了统计k-medians、k-means和k-centers的可复现算法。对于统计欧几里得k-medians和k-means，提出了多项式样本复杂度的O(1)近似算法；对于统计欧几里得k-centers，提出了带O(1)加性误差的算法，但样本复杂度为指数级。

Result: 实现了统计欧几里得k-medians和k-means的可复现O(1)近似算法，样本复杂度为poly(d)；统计欧几里得k-centers的可复现O(1)近似算法，带O(1)加性误差，但样本复杂度为exp(d)。在2D合成分布上的实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 成功设计了统计聚类问题的可复现算法，在k-medians和k-means问题上取得了多项式样本复杂度的良好结果，但在k-centers问题上样本复杂度较高，显示了不同聚类问题在可复现性框架下的难度差异。

Abstract: We design replicable algorithms in the context of statistical clustering
under the recently introduced notion of replicability from Impagliazzo et al.
[2022]. According to this definition, a clustering algorithm is replicable if,
with high probability, its output induces the exact same partition of the
sample space after two executions on different inputs drawn from the same
distribution, when its internal randomness is shared across the executions. We
propose such algorithms for the statistical $k$-medians, statistical $k$-means,
and statistical $k$-centers problems by utilizing approximation routines for
their combinatorial counterparts in a black-box manner. In particular, we
demonstrate a replicable $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for statistical
Euclidean $k$-medians ($k$-means) with $\operatorname{poly}(d)$ sample
complexity. We also describe an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm with an
additional $O(1)$-additive error for statistical Euclidean $k$-centers, albeit
with $\exp(d)$ sample complexity. In addition, we provide experiments on
synthetic distributions in 2D using the $k$-means++ implementation from sklearn
as a black-box that validate our theoretical results.

Motivation: 解决现实应用中需要在上下文变化环境下实现公平收益分配的问题，其中跨上下文的最低奖励约束聚合带来了更好的性能和可行性，但也引入了技术挑战。

Method: 设计并分析了两种算法：乐观优先考虑性能的算法和悲观强制约束满足的算法。

Result: 为每种算法推导了问题相关的遗憾和约束违反上界，并建立了下界证明时间依赖性的最优性。

Conclusion: 揭示了先前工作中利用的自由探索原则的基本局限性，证明了时间依赖性的最优性。

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Motivation: 针对Mao等人(2022)的RestartQ-UCB算法存在的两个核心问题：完全遗忘（重启后丢失所有环境信息）和预定重启（不考虑策略与当前环境动态的不兼容性）。

Method: 引入了三种重启方法：部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，用于改进RestartQ-UCB和RANDOMIZEDQ算法。

Result: 在多种不同环境中实现了接近最优的实证性能，相对于RestartQ-UCB将动态遗憾降低了高达91%。

Conclusion: 提出的三种重启范式有效解决了现有重启算法的问题，显著提升了非平稳强化学习的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Conclusion: 成功设计了多种可复现的大间隔半空间学习算法，在不同参数范围内实现了样本复杂度和时间复杂度的优化平衡，为可复现学习提供了新的高效解决方案。

Abstract: We provide efficient replicable algorithms for the problem of learning
large-margin halfspaces. Our results improve upon the algorithms provided by
Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell [STOC, 2022]. We design the first
dimension-independent replicable algorithms for this task which runs in
polynomial time, is proper, and has strictly improved sample complexity
compared to the one achieved by Impagliazzo et al. [2022] with respect to all
the relevant parameters. Moreover, our first algorithm has sample complexity
that is optimal with respect to the accuracy parameter $\epsilon$. We also
design an SGD-based replicable algorithm that, in some parameters' regimes,
achieves better sample and time complexity than our first algorithm. Departing
from the requirement of polynomial time algorithms, using the
DP-to-Replicability reduction of Bun, Gaboardi, Hopkins, Impagliazzo, Lei,
Pitassi, Sorrell, and Sivakumar [STOC, 2023], we show how to obtain a
replicable algorithm for large-margin halfspaces with improved sample
complexity with respect to the margin parameter $\tau$, but running time doubly
exponential in $1/\tau^2$ and worse sample complexity dependence on $\epsilon$
than one of our previous algorithms. We then design an improved algorithm with
better sample complexity than all three of our previous algorithms and running
time exponential in $1/\tau^{2}$.

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE框架使用KL散度惩罚来鼓励潜在空间匹配因子化高斯先验，但作者发现这种机制不可靠，无法有效强制执行目标分布，导致表示纠缠问题。

Method: 提出可编程先验框架，基于最大均值差异(MMD)方法，允许显式塑造潜在空间，同时开发了无监督的潜在可预测性评分(LPS)来量化纠缠程度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和Tiny ImageNet等复杂数据集上实现了最先进的相互独立性，且没有常见的重建权衡问题，能够构建与语义特征更好对齐的复杂先验。

Conclusion: 该工作为表示工程提供了基础工具，为模型可识别性和因果推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Motivation: Mamba作为新提出的线性时间序列模型，虽然计算效率高且实证表现强，但其理论机制理解有限，需要对其上下文学习能力进行严谨分析。

Method: 研究Mamba在低维非线性目标函数任务中的上下文学习能力，特别关注单索引模型，通过梯度预训练方法分析其测试时特征学习机制。

Result: 证明Mamba能够通过测试时特征学习高效提取相关方向，样本复杂度优于线性Transformer（表现为核方法），与非线性Transformer相当，接近信息理论最优速率。

Conclusion: Mamba的非线性门控机制在特征提取中起关键作用，这是其实现计算效率和高性能的根本驱动力。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Method: 引入基于新型速度驱动传输成本的Y形生成流，具有次线性指数（0到1之间），通过可扩展的神经ODE训练目标实现。

Result: 在合成、图像和生物学数据集上，Y流恢复了层次感知结构，在分布指标上优于强流基线，并以更少的积分步骤达到目标。

Conclusion: Y形生成流通过共享路径和分支结构有效捕捉数据中的层次结构，提高了生成模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

Motivation: 扩散模型的预训练过程存在明显的学习速度阶段差异，但现有后训练加速方法完全忽略了这一特性。

Method: 采用自适应剪枝策略：中间快速学习阶段保守剪枝以保留关键特征，早期和后期慢速学习阶段进行更激进的剪枝，与预训练学习速度变化保持一致。

Result: 在DiT和SDXL上的大量实验表明，该方法在采样速度上实现显著提升，且不损害输出质量，大幅超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为更高效和鲁棒的无训练扩散加速提供了新视角，首次明确地将预训练动态与加速过程相协调。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

Method: 提出跨尺度重建方法，从粗粒度序列重建细粒度序列以显式捕获跨尺度关联；设计查询库并融入全局多尺度上下文以克服固定窗口大小的限制

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上使用九种评估指标进行广泛实验，验证了CrossAD的有效性

Conclusion: CrossAD框架通过考虑跨尺度关联和跨窗口建模，在时间序列异常检测中表现出色，实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

### [112] [Learning Dynamics of VLM Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11978)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CW-DPO是一种两阶段的视觉语言模型对齐方法，通过温和负样本和监督微调来稳定训练，然后使用基于平均标记对数概率的冷却权重来缩放DPO的负项，抑制无信息梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于偏好的视觉语言模型微调很脆弱，琐碎的负样本会注入无信息梯度导致训练不稳定。

Method: 第一阶段：使用温和负样本进行监督微调，通过低权重平滑监督来正则化基础策略；第二阶段：应用DPO目标，其中负项通过基于模型对每个负样本的平均标记对数概率计算的冷却权重进行缩放。

Result: 在各种VLM任务中，CW-DPO相比仅SFT和普通DPO实现了更稳定的优化、更好的校准和更高的成对胜率，同时收敛步数更少。

Conclusion: 在冷却偏好之前平滑学习动态是稳健VLM对齐的简单通用原则。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision
boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the
homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw
similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral
cell-count, as the model is trained.

Conclusion: 损失函数景观可能不像传统认为的那样充满局部最小值，精确二阶方法失败提供了对神经网络优化几何结构的新见解。

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our

Conclusion: 神经网络学习过程中的影响关系是动态变化的，分阶段归因框架能更准确地揭示模型学习语义层次结构的发展过程。

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

TL;DR: Chimera是一个统一模型，通过状态空间模型直接融入数据拓扑结构，无需领域特定的偏置，在语言、视觉和图领域均取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer方法依赖自注意力机制，将数据视为无序集合，忽略了数据的邻域结构或图拓扑，需要设计任务特定的偏置（如位置嵌入、随机游走）来融入拓扑，但这些偏置设计复杂且可能阻碍泛化。

Method: 提出Chimera模型，将状态空间模型（自然不需要位置嵌入）推广到捕获任意图拓扑，并提出算法优化：对于有向无环图可实现线性时间递归，对于一般图通过数学松弛达到Transformer的二次复杂度。

Result: Chimera在GLUE上比BERT高0.7分，在ImageNet-1k上比ViT高2.6%，在Long Range Graph Benchmark上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 验证了Chimera的核心贡献，支持数据拓扑是跨模态的强大归纳偏置这一观点。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

TL;DR: 提出了GRACE框架，通过自适应频谱专家和跨集分布校准技术解决图少样本学习中的局部结构异质性和分布不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图少样本学习方法存在两个主要局限：1）使用预定义的统一图滤波器无法处理真实图中局部拓扑结构的异质性；2）假设支持集和查询集来自相同分布，但在少样本条件下支持集的有限标记数据可能无法充分捕捉查询集的复杂分布。

Conclusion: GRACE框架有效解决了图少样本学习中的关键挑战，在理论和实验层面都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护隐私，但参与者对训练数据的独立性使其容易受到投毒攻击，且协作会传播偏见。本文旨在研究恶意客户端如何故意发送有偏模型来增加系统偏见。

Method: 通过解决公平性指标（如人口统计均等和均等化机会）的优化问题来计算公平性损失，恶意客户端在训练时增加公平性损失来生成有偏模型。

Result: 实验表明，即使只有一个恶意客户端，攻击也能将偏见增加高达90%，且能抵抗最先进的拜占庭鲁棒和公平感知聚合方案。

Conclusion: 该攻击隐蔽且难以检测，揭示了联邦学习系统在公平性方面的脆弱性，即使数据分布均匀，单个恶意客户端也能显著增加系统偏见。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

Conclusion: 该研究为如何将预算学习应用于生存数据提供了理论和实验基础，并展示了其相对于其他方法的优势。

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

Motivation: 分析大型语言模型在思维链推理中的自验证反思机制如何贡献于性能提升，由于LLMs在检测思维链错误方面能力有限，反思机制的实际效果尚不明确。

Method: 构建最小化推理框架，支持小型Transformer进行无自然语言的基本自验证反思，确保分析清晰性并降低实验成本。理论证明自验证反思在验证误差有界时能保证改进。

Result: 实验显示仅几百万参数的小型Transformer在训练和反思执行中都能从自验证中受益，在整数乘法和数独任务中达到显著的LLM级别性能。强化学习主要优化浅层统计模式而非忠实减少验证误差。

Conclusion: 将生成式Transformer与判别式验证相结合，本质上促进了思维链推理，这种效果不依赖于模型规模和自然语言。

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

TL;DR: 该论文对元学习样本重加权方法在标签噪声下的训练动态进行了理论分析，揭示了其三个训练阶段，并基于分析提出了一个轻量级替代方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 元学习样本重加权方法虽然能利用少量干净样本来指导训练，但其行为和训练动态缺乏理论理解，特别是在标签噪声环境下的表现机制不明确。

Method: 首先对元重加权方法进行严格的理论分析，揭示其训练轨迹的三个阶段；然后基于分析设计了一个轻量级替代方法，集成了均值中心化、行偏移和标签符号调制等技术。

Result: 在合成和真实标签噪声基准测试中，所提出的方法一致地优于强力的重加权/选择基线方法。

Conclusion: 元重加权的训练动态可分解为三个阶段，其机制依赖于训练信号与干净子集信号之间的相似性加权耦合；提出的轻量级替代方法能够获得更稳定的性能，同时避免了昂贵的双层优化。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

Result: 在六个真实医疗数据集上的广泛实验显示达到了最先进的性能，消融研究确认了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: DE3S通过精确的形状发现和创新的学习框架，成功解决了医疗早期时间序列分类中的准确性和早期性权衡问题。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

TL;DR: 提出Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion框架，通过Koopman算子理论将非线性扩散动态提升到线性潜在空间，实现单步采样和可解释生成轨迹，解决扩散模型采样慢与可解释性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但迭代去噪过程导致采样速度慢。现有单步方法虽然加速推理，但牺牲了扩散动态的可解释性和精细控制能力，而这些正是可编辑生成等应用的关键优势。

Method: 基于Koopman算子理论，将非线性扩散动态提升到潜在空间，其中演化由全局线性算子控制，实现闭式轨迹解。设计分层架构，通过尺度特定Koopman子空间解耦不同空间分辨率的生成动态，系统捕获从粗到细的细节。

Result: Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion不仅实现了具有竞争力的单步生成性能，还通过谱分析提供了理解和操纵生成过程的原则性机制。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样与可解释性之间的差距，为生成建模中的可解释图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

Method: IMDGA框架包含三个紧密集成的模块，在保持可解释性的同时，协调图结构和文本特征的多层次扰动，实现平衡攻击效果和可理解性的对抗攻击。

Result: 通过理论分析和多数据集、多架构的实证评估，IMDGA在可解释性、攻击效果、隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法，成功暴露了Graph-LLMs的语义维度漏洞。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and
resources are publicly available at

Conclusion: MoRA通过实例特定的动态适配有效整合分子图结构与LLM，在保持LLM通用推理能力的同时提升分子任务性能。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

Conclusion: 可以通过预期执行性效应的强度来设置正则化参数，从而更好地应对执行性学习中的分布变化问题。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively
maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for
papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.

Conclusion: HiLoRA提供了一种无需训练的高效LoRA重用方法，通过分层路由机制显著提升了领域泛化性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用傅里叶特征物理信息极限学习机(GFF-PIELM)，通过集成傅里叶特征映射作为激活函数，解决了传统PIELM在处理高频和变频PDE时的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PIELM在处理高频和变频偏微分方程时面临挑战，需要改进以有效捕捉目标解的不同频率分量。

Method: 1) 将傅里叶特征映射变体集成到ELM中作为基于傅里叶的激活函数；2) 为隐藏神经元分配频率系数集；3) 开发创新的超参数初始化方法，通过监控ELM输出权重分布。

Result: 在5个案例研究共10个数值例子中验证了GFF-PIELM的可行性，相比传统PIELM显著提高了预测精度，且不增加训练时间和架构复杂度。

Conclusion: GFF-PIELM成功扩展了PIELM解决高频和变频PDE的能力，其初始化策略可能启发其他物理信息机器学习框架的改进。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全策略改进理论主要关注离线、表格化强化学习，缺乏在在线、深度强化学习环境中的理论保证。

Method: 开发理论框架限制策略更新在当前策略的邻域内，结合局部转移和奖励损失与正则化策略更新，提出DeepSPI算法。

Result: 在ALE-57基准测试中，DeepSPI匹配或超越了PPO和DeepMDPs等强基线方法，同时保持理论保证。

Conclusion: 成功将安全策略改进理论扩展到在线深度强化学习，提供了理论保证并实现了竞争性性能。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

TL;DR: 首次对具有演化奖励函数的单时间尺度actor-critic算法进行有限时间收敛分析，证明在马尔可夫采样下可实现O(1/√T)收敛率，与静态奖励的最佳已知速率匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实用的强化学习算法使用演化奖励函数（如奖励塑造、熵正则化、课程学习），但其理论基础尚不完善。

Method: 在马尔可夫采样下分析单时间尺度actor-critic算法，考虑每个时间步可能变化的奖励参数对策略优化和值估计的影响。

Result: 在标准假设下，推导了actor和critic误差的非渐近界，证明只要奖励参数演化足够慢，就能实现O(1/√T)收敛率。

Conclusion: 为许多流行的RL技术提供了理论基础，并在静态奖励情况下将分布不匹配分析的最佳已知速率提高了log²T倍。

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

Motivation: 随着用户使用私密信息与LLM交互，需要安全加密通信。同态加密虽支持加密数据计算，但文本生成特别是下一个令牌预测仍是实践障碍。

Method: 采用基于旅行商问题(TSP)的令牌重排序策略，结合后处理步骤减少近似误差，防止生成崩溃。

Result: 理论分析和实验证明，该方法防止生成崩溃，提高生成文本连贯性，全程保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了实用且保护隐私的LLM推理的可行性。

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

Motivation: 解决大规模组织中跨模态数据质量管理的挑战，特别是表格、图像和文本数据共存时的跨模态错误检测问题。

Method: 在四个数据集上对五种基线方法进行基准测试，包括Cleanlab标签错误检测框架和DataScope数据评估方法，结合AutoML框架进行评估。

Result: Cleanlab和DataScope在结合AutoML框架时取得了最高的F1分数，但在处理重尾真实世界数据时性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 当前跨模态错误检测方法在处理真实世界数据时存在局限性，需要进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

Result: 在真实世界的大规模异质图上进行了广泛实验，证明该方法优于现有的最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效预训练异质图上的GNN，通过结构感知和语义感知任务解决了异质图处理和语义不匹配问题，提高了模型的迁移能力。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

Conclusion: 连续距离函数为生成AI模型在功能材料发现中的评估提供了更准确和可靠的方法，有助于推动应对气候变化等科学挑战的材料研究。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

Motivation: 传统动态定价方法通常假设需求函数具有特定参数形式，这在现实场景中可能不成立，限制了方法的适用性。

Method: 使用高斯过程建模需求函数作为黑盒函数，基于贝叶斯优化开发定价算法，适用于无限和有限库存两种场景。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是复杂不确定环境中动态定价的强大实用工具，提供了后悔保证来量化学习效率。

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了平坦最小值与泛化能力的关系，指出尖锐最小值在正则化条件下往往与更好的泛化性能、校准性、鲁棒性和功能一致性相关，挑战了平坦最小值必然对应更好泛化的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为平坦最小值与更好的泛化能力相关，但近期研究显示这种关系更加复杂，存在理论反例和实证例外。本文旨在重新探讨尖锐性在模型性能中的作用。

Method: 进行了广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，比较了不同正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）下的损失景观几何特性。

Result: 研究发现正则化模型往往收敛到更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值反而与更好的泛化性能、校准性、鲁棒性和功能一致性相关。无正则化的基线模型倾向于平坦最小值但性能更差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦性主导解的几何特性，尖锐最小值可以反映更合适的归纳偏置（特别是在正则化条件下），需要对损失景观几何进行以函数为中心的重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型擅长噪声到数据的生成，但在复杂分布间的转换任务中表现不佳。桥匹配模型虽能解决分布间转换问题，但尚未应用于时间相关数据序列，而视频任务中保持时间一致性至关重要。

Method: TCVBM框架扩展桥匹配到时间相关视频序列，在扩散桥中显式建模序列间依赖关系，将时间相关性直接纳入采样过程。

Result: 在视频帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率三个任务中，TCVBM在多个定量指标上均优于基于桥匹配和扩散模型的传统方法，展现出更好的生成质量和重建保真度。

Conclusion: TCVBM成功将桥匹配扩展到时间相关视频序列，通过显式建模时间相关性，在视频任务中实现了更优的性能，为视频生成和操作任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

Conclusion: 噪声偏移是扩散模型中普遍存在的问题，NAG提供了一种简单有效的校正方法，能显著改善生成性能。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Result: 发现跨组织联邦学习面临一系列现有研究尚未充分捕捉的挑战，这些问题与跨设备联邦学习等其他形式有很大不同

Conclusion: 讨论了有助于克服这些挑战的未来研究方向

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

TL;DR: 知识蒸馏的功能性分析显示，其知识转移效果有限且存在负面知识不对称转移问题，更像数据依赖的规则化器而非压缩机制。


<details>

Motivation: 理解知识蒸馏作为压缩机制的功能影响，量化其压缩能力和知识转移效果，区分压缩与架构缩减的影响。

Method: 采用假设检验、控制组和随机控制蒸馏方法，分析不同数据模态下的知识转移机制，探索多种蒸馏变体和模型尺寸的蒸馏缩放规律。

Result: 在某些模态和架构中存在统计显著的知识转移，但程度低于预期；显著知识转移情况下存在严重的负面知识不对称转移，存在安全隐患。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏主要作为数据依赖的规则化器运行，具有负面不对称收益，而非有效的压缩机制。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Conclusion: 通过解耦变量发现和动力学拟合问题，利用FIMs实现了稳定且高效的动力学系统粗粒化方法。

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了元主动特征获取（meta-AFA）问题，并开发了Learning-to-Measure（L2M）方法，通过可靠的跨任务不确定性量化和基于条件互信息的贪婪特征获取策略，在稀疏标签和高缺失率场景下实现高效的特征获取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AFA方法通常针对单一预定任务，缺乏可扩展性，且在实际应用中面临特征系统性缺失和任务特定标签有限的问题，需要开发能够跨任务学习的通用特征获取方法。

Method: L2M包含两个核心组件：1）基于序列建模或自回归预训练的无任务可靠不确定性量化；2）不确定性引导的贪婪特征获取代理，最大化条件互信息。该方法直接在具有回顾性缺失的数据集上操作，无需每个任务重新训练。

Result: 在合成和真实世界表格基准测试中，L2M匹配或超越了任务特定基线方法，特别是在标签稀缺和高缺失率的情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: L2M通过元学习方法有效解决了跨任务特征获取问题，在保持性能的同时显著提高了方法的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

TL;DR: Laminar是一个用于大语言模型强化学习后训练的可扩展系统，通过完全解耦架构解决了现有RL框架因轨迹生成延迟高度偏斜导致的GPU利用率低下问题。

Motivation: 现有异步RL系统依赖全局权重同步，这种锁步更新方式不适合RL训练中高度偏斜且不断演化的轨迹生成延迟分布，严重限制了训练效率。

Method: 提出完全解耦架构：1) 用中继工作者层级替代全局更新，实现异步细粒度权重同步；2) 动态重新打包机制将长尾轨迹整合到专用rollout上，最大化生成吞吐量。

Result: 在1024-GPU集群上的评估显示，Laminar相比最先进系统实现了最高5.48倍的训练吞吐量加速，同时减少了模型收敛时间。

Conclusion: Laminar通过轨迹级异步和完全解耦设计，为大规模RL后训练提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，显著提升了训练效率和系统稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

TL;DR: 提出了Bellman Wasserstein距离（BWD），一种无需训练智能体即可评估离线数据集质量的方法，并在D4RL MuJoCo任务中验证其与离线RL算法性能的强相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习的数据集质量差异很大，但在实践中难以预先评估数据集质量，因为数据的来源和技能组成未知。需要一种无需训练智能体就能估计离线数据集质量的方法。

Method: 研究了一系列代理指标，从简单的累积奖励到基于学习价值的估计器，并引入了BWD——一种价值感知的最优传输评分，通过行为评论家和状态条件最优传输公式计算，无需环境交互或完整策略优化。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务中，BWD与聚合多个离线RL算法的oracle性能得分强相关，能有效预测标准智能体在给定数据集上的表现。将BWD作为正则化器集成到策略优化中，能显式地将学习策略推离随机行为并提高回报。

Conclusion: 价值感知的分布信号如BWD是筛选离线RL数据集和策略优化的实用工具。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs
zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on
synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

Conclusion: SG-XDEAT通过双流表示学习和自适应噪声抑制机制，为表格数据提供了一个更鲁棒的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

lightweight approach to AI safety with no additional training data or model
fine-tuning, while incurring only a small computational overhead at inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CoRA框架，通过保持预训练基础模型参数不变，结合Granger因果嵌入和零初始化条件注入机制，有效整合多模态外生协变量，提升时间序列基础模型的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型主要基于单变量时间序列预训练，无法有效利用现实预测任务中多模态协变量的关键信息，限制了模型性能。

Method: CoRA框架：1）保持预训练基础模型骨干网络冻结作为特征提取器；2）使用Granger因果嵌入自动评估协变量与目标变量的因果预测关系；3）采用零初始化条件注入机制逐步整合外生信息。

Result: 在协变量感知预测任务上实现31.1%的MSE降低，优于现有最先进的协变量感知深度预测器，在完整或少量训练样本下均表现优异。

Conclusion: CoRA框架与多种先进时间序列基础模型兼容，能够扩展到其他模态的协变量，为时间序列基础模型的实际应用提供了实用范式。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对城际客车异常停靠检测的新方法，通过稀疏感知分割、局部时间指标引导调整和图神经网络，有效解决了GPS轨迹稀疏和标注数据有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城际客车异常停靠检测对乘客安全和运营可靠性至关重要，但面临GPS轨迹稀疏和标注数据有限的挑战。现有方法假设密集采样或规律运动模式，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 1) 稀疏感知分割方法根据局部时空密度自适应定义段边界；2) 提出三个领域特定指标捕捉异常停靠行为；3) 局部时间指标引导调整通过局部相似图平滑指标；4) 构建时空图，应用标签传播和GCN学习关系模式；5) 自训练模块整合高置信度伪标签迭代改进预测。

Result: 在真实客车数据上的实验显示，仅使用10个标注实例就达到了0.854的AUC和0.866的AP，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效处理数据稀疏性和标签稀缺性，显著提升了异常停靠检测的性能，为城际客车安全监控提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在高维逆问题中表现出强大的生成先验能力，但当只有损坏或含噪观测数据可用时，学习这些模型仍然具有挑战性

Method: 提出DiffEM方法，利用条件扩散模型在E步从观测数据重建干净数据，在M步使用重建数据优化条件扩散模型

Result: 理论上在适当统计条件下为DiffEM迭代提供了单调收敛保证，实验证明在多种图像重建任务中有效

Conclusion: DiffEM方法能够从损坏数据中成功训练扩散模型，为高维逆问题提供了有效的生成先验学习方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在化学预训练图神经网络模型上进行多任务微调的方法，发现这种方法能显著提升药物发现中关键端点预测的性能，特别是在大数据量时效果更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学预训练模型具有提取通用化学知识的潜力，可以改进药物发现关键端点（如靶点效力和ADMET性质）的预测。多任务学习已被证明能提升预测模型性能，但尚未在化学预训练模型的微调中充分探索。

Method: 在化学预训练图神经网络模型（如KERMT和KGPT）上进行多任务微调，并与未经预训练的图神经网络模型进行对比。发布了两个多任务ADMET数据集分割以支持更准确的基准测试。

Result: 多任务微调显著优于未经预训练的图神经网络模型。令人惊讶的是，KERMT模型的多任务微调性能提升在大数据量时最为显著。

Conclusion: 多任务微调化学预训练模型是提升药物性质预测性能的有效方法，特别是在大数据场景下。提供了加速的KERMT实现和基准数据集以支持工业级药物发现工作流。

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARVQ是一种结合校正适配器和分组残差向量量化的后训练压缩方法，可将LLM嵌入层压缩至约1.6比特，减少存储需求和内存占用，适用于边缘设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的嵌入层参数庞大，导致存储需求高和内存占用大，特别是在边缘设备上存在内存限制。压缩嵌入层可以释放内存带宽并加速推理。

Method: 提出CARVQ方法，结合线性非线性映射的组合，通过校正适配器和分组残差向量量化来压缩模型嵌入层，无需专用硬件支持低位存储。

Result: 在多个预训练LLM上测试，包括LLaMA、Qwen2.5和Phi-4系列模型，在生成、判别、数学和推理任务中，CARVQ在保持合理困惑度和准确性的同时，实现了比标量化更低的平均比特数。

Conclusion: CARVQ是一种与最先进变换器量化方法兼容的新型压缩技术，可在支持4位内存的任何硬件上无缝集成，为LLM在边缘设备的高效部署迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

TL;DR: 本文研究了决策树学习中的局部搜索操作（调整切割阈值或交换特征）以最小化分类错误的问题，发现这些问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但通过参数化复杂性分析找到了固定参数可解的条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策树学习算法通常包含启发式局部搜索操作，但缺乏对这些操作计算复杂性的系统分析。本文旨在理解这些问题的难易程度及其可解条件。

Method: 采用参数化复杂性分析方法，考虑特征数量d和域大小D等参数，证明了在d和D都较小的情况下问题具有固定参数可解性，并给出了具体算法。

Result: 发现当特征数量d和域大小D都较小时，问题可在(D+1)^(2d)·|I|^O(1)时间内解决，其中|I|是输入大小。同时提供了概念验证实现和实证结果。

Conclusion: 虽然决策树局部优化问题在一般情况下是NP难的，但当特征数量和域大小都较小时，存在高效的固定参数算法，这为实际应用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Motivation: 解决农业环境中异构农场环境和隐私敏感数据的问题，同时减少通信开销并保护数据隐私。

Method: 采用三层架构：客户端智能农场、作物特定聚合器和全局模型聚合器，通过季节性订阅机制让农场加入作物特定集群进行协作训练。

Result: 实验表明本地和作物层模型能紧密跟踪实际产量模式，显著优于标准机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 分层联邦学习在农业环境中具有显著优势，特别适用于异构农场环境和隐私敏感数据场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变量重要性方法依赖于单一模型和观测特征，但实际中重要变量常被遗漏，且不同模型可能给出不同的变量重要性（Rashomon效应），导致结果不可靠。

Method: 采用Rashomon集合方法，构建近最优模型集合，通过分析这些模型集合来估计变量重要性的边界，即使存在未观测变量也能保证结果的鲁棒性。

Result: 理论分析证明了方法的鲁棒性，半合成模拟实验显示良好性能，并在信用风险评估任务中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE方法能够有效处理变量重要性分析中的未观测变量和模型不确定性，提供更可靠的变量重要性边界估计。

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络极易受到对抗攻击，这对安全和关键应用构成重大风险。需要一种轻量级、即插即用的检测解决方案。

Method: 使用KL散度（对密集低幅度扰动敏感）和L0相似度（对稀疏高影响变化敏感）两种互补指标，当它们的类别预测不一致时检测对抗攻击。仅需在预训练图像编码器上用干净图像进行简单微调。

Result: 在ResNet/CIFAR-10上达到精度0.94、召回率0.81；在CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet上达到精度0.66、召回率0.85。定理条件满足时能持续有效检测对抗样本。

Conclusion: KoALA是一种轻量级、即插即用的对抗检测解决方案，适用于现有模型和多种数据模态，无需架构修改或对抗性训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有omniprediction方法存在局限性：基于multicalibration的方法样本复杂度不优，基于对抗游戏的方法会产生复杂随机化预测器。需要设计更直接、非随机化的高效算法。

Method: 利用proper loss集合的结构特性，设计直接的非随机化算法，改进现有的在线到批量转换方法。

Result: 证明了multicalibration比omniprediction更难，前者样本复杂度不优；提出了更高效的直接算法。

Conclusion: 通过利用proper loss的结构特性，可以设计出比现有方法更简单高效的omniprediction算法，避免复杂随机化预测器。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural
games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新的大型语言模型频繁发布，开发者需要决定是否切换到新模型。虽然人类评估是黄金标准，但成本高且不可扩展。现有的LLM作为评估者方法存在严重的正向偏见问题。

Method: 提出了最优少数否决策略来缓解偏见，并针对需要更高精度的场景，提出了基于回归的框架，使用少量人工标注数据直接建模验证器偏见。

Result: 在366个高中Python程序的代码反馈任务上，回归方法将最大绝对误差降低到仅1.2%，比14个最先进LLM的最佳集成性能提升了2倍。

Conclusion: LLM作为评估者存在系统性正向偏见，提出的回归框架能有效缓解这一问题，显著提高评估准确性。

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Motivation: AI智能体评估存在诸多挑战，影响了我们对智能体实际性能的理解，需要更可靠的评估方法来确保智能体在现实世界中的可靠性。

Method: 开发标准化评估框架，在数百个虚拟机上进行并行评估；进行三维分析（模型、支架、基准）；使用LLM辅助日志检查来发现未报告的行为。

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

*Owen Queen,Harrison G. Zhang,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGBench是一个用于评估语言模型在科学文献解释能力的新基准，基于临床遗传学专家标注数据，测试模型在提取实验结果、评估证据强度、分类实验成果等方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因变异解释方法耗时费力，生成式语言模型有望加速这一过程，但现有基准任务过于狭窄，无法反映真实研究需求。

Method: 基于ClinGen专家标注的临床遗传学文献构建CGBench基准，测试8种不同语言模型在三个关键任务上的表现：精确提取实验结果、判断证据强度、分类和描述实验成果。

Result: 模型在文献解释方面显示出潜力但存在显著差距，推理模型在细粒度任务上表现优异，非推理模型在高层次解释上更好，模型经常产生幻觉或误解结果。

Conclusion: CGBench揭示了语言模型在科学文献精确解释方面的优势与不足，为AI在临床遗传学和更广泛科学领域的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

TL;DR: 提出一种训练LLMs生成顺序澄清问题的方法，通过类似扩散模型的正向和反向过程来优化用户偏好获取


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在用户历史有限的情况下，通过澄清问题获取用户偏好对个性化推荐至关重要，但跨领域生成有效的顺序澄清问题仍具挑战性

Method: 采用两阶段训练过程：正向过程从用户档案生成问题并逐步移除答案作为"噪声"；反向过程训练模型通过提问有效澄清问题来"去噪"用户档案

Result: 该方法显著提高了LLMs在提出漏斗问题和有效获取用户偏好方面的能力

Conclusion: 提出的基于扩散模型思想的训练方法能够有效提升LLMs生成顺序澄清问题的能力，从而更好地获取用户偏好

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalTrace是一个集成在SmartPilot工业CoPilot中的神经符号因果分析模块，通过数据驱动因果分析结合工业本体和知识图谱，提供因果发现、反事实推理和根因分析功能，实现透明可解释的决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造环境不仅需要准确预测，还需要对过程异常、根因和潜在干预提供可解释的见解。现有AI系统通常作为孤立的黑盒运行，缺乏预测、解释和因果推理的无缝集成，限制了在高风险工业环境中的可信度和实用性。

Result: 在学术火箭组装测试平台上，CausalTrace与领域专家达成高度一致（ROUGE-1: 0.91），根因分析性能优异（MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92）。在C3AN评估中获得4.59/5分，展示了部署的精确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: CausalTrace通过神经符号因果分析成功解决了工业AI系统中预测、解释和因果推理的集成问题，提供了透明、可解释的决策支持，在高风险制造环境中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACT是一个评估LLM生成代码在功能正确性和契约遵守性方面的框架，通过扩展HumanEval+和MBPP+基准，提供包含契约违反测试用例的评估套件，并引入新的量化指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准主要评估功能正确性，忽略了现实软件中契约遵守（处理异常输入）的重要性，导致无法衡量模型生成的代码是否真正健壮可靠。

Method: 扩展HumanEval+和MBPP+基准，构建专注于契约违反的测试套件；系统分析不同提示条件下的代码生成；在提示中增加契约违反测试用例；引入新的契约遵守量化指标。

Result: 在提示中增加契约违反测试用例相比仅使用契约描述，能显著提升模型遵守契约的能力；PACT能够揭示传统基准忽略的关键错误。

Conclusion: PACT提供了严格且可解释的指标来评估LLM生成代码在功能和契约遵守两方面的健壮性，填补了现有评估框架的重要空白。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种地理空间感知层(GAL)，将LLM智能体与结构化地球数据结合，用于改进灾害响应中的资源分配决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统计方法缺乏语义上下文、跨事件泛化能力差且可解释性有限，而LLM虽然具有少样本泛化能力但受限于文本且缺乏地理感知。

Method: 开发GAL层，从原始野火检测开始，自动从外部地理数据库中检索并整合基础设施、人口统计、地形和天气信息，生成带单位注释的感知脚本。

Result: 在真实野火场景中评估表明，地理空间接地的智能体在多个LLM模型上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成基于证据的资源分配建议，并可泛化到洪水、飓风等其他灾害类型。

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkPilot是一个无需训练就能自动优化大型推理模型推理过程的框架，通过进化过程生成think-prefixes来引导模型实现更好的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型存在推理效率低下和偏离目标的问题，而现有的无需训练方法要么依赖僵化的启发式规则，要么只能提供描述性但不可操作的分析。

Method: 使用进化过程生成think-prefixes，这些指令基于推理行为分类学进行演化，引导模型实现更优性能。

Result: ThinkPilot显著改善了准确率与推理长度的权衡关系，大幅提升了安全性（如将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B的StrongREJECT分数从27.0%降至0.7），增强了指令跟随能力，并能与现有基于训练的方法协同工作。

Conclusion: think-prefixes能够可靠地控制大型推理模型的推理行为，不同任务对特定行为分布有强烈偏好，ThinkPilot通过自动识别和激发这些行为，为将模型推理与任务需求对齐提供了可泛化的框架。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文重新诠释了AI智能体中的学习角色，将其视为具有计算能力的随机动力系统，强调时间在学习推理中的关键作用，并提出从归纳学习转向转导学习，以优化解决新任务的时间而非减少重构误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI推理智能体是否具有通用性，能否通过思维链推理解决任何可计算任务，以及学习推理的关键因素——是模型大小还是训练数据规模。

Method: 将AI智能体重新解释为计算能力的随机动力系统，提出转导学习方法，关注捕获数据的算法结构以减少解决新任务所需时间。

Result: 理论推导表明，通用求解器使用过去数据实现的最优加速与其算法信息紧密相关，并推导出推理时间与训练时间之间的幂律缩放关系。

Conclusion: 单纯扩大模型规模可能导致智能体成为仅能暴力求解任务的"专家"而非真正智能，优化推理模型的关键应是时间而非空间，时间在学习中的关键作用尚未得到充分重视。

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

TL;DR: HiCoTraj是一个基于大语言模型的零样本人口统计推理框架，通过分层思维链提示从轨迹数据中推断年龄、性别、收入等人口属性，无需标注训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于移动轨迹的人口统计推断方法严重依赖带标注的大规模轨迹数据，导致可解释性差且在不同数据集和用户群体间泛化能力有限。

Method: 将轨迹转换为语义丰富的自然语言表示，包括详细活动记录和多尺度访问摘要，然后通过分层思维链推理（事实特征提取、行为模式分析、结构化输出的人口统计推断）指导大语言模型。

Result: 在真实世界轨迹数据上的实验评估表明，HiCoTraj在零样本场景下对多个人口统计属性实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: HiCoTraj解决了标注人口统计数据稀缺的挑战，同时提供了透明的推理链，实现了无需训练数据的零样本人口统计推断。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过环境交互学习能够显著提升LLM的具身决策能力，EmboMatrix为培养真正智能的具身代理提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

Motivation: 传统异常检测主要关注轨迹级分析，但在大规模数据集中检测个体相对于自身历史模式的异常移动行为仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 学习语义丰富的移动表示，整合位置意义和时间模式；采用行为聚类感知建模机制，从正常活动中构建个性化行为档案，并通过跨时期行为比较识别异常。

Conclusion: 通过直接从无标签数据中学习个体行为，BeSTAD将异常检测推向个性化和可解释的移动分析。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

Motivation: 随着LLM技术的快速发展，许多应用需要随机性，但LLMs在处理随机性方面的能力尚不明确。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，考虑外部工具可访问性、任务类型、模型状态和提示策略等因素，涵盖生成随机数、随机字符串、洗牌和随机性质量评估等任务。

Result: LLMs能够生成具有一定随机性的输出，但性能不一致，且与预期行为存在显著偏差。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明LLMs在处理随机性任务方面存在关键限制，需要改进才能有效处理涉及随机性的任务。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Conclusion: 为自主构建未知复杂环境的程序化世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

### [192] [Precise Attribute Intensity Control in Large Language Models via Targeted Representation Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12121)
*Rongzhi Zhang,Liqin Ye,Yuzhao Heng,Xiang Chen,Tong Yu,Lingkai Kong,Sudheer Chava,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种精确控制LLM输出属性强度的方法，通过目标达成问题重构、时序差分学习训练值函数和梯度干预隐藏表示，实现细粒度的连续属性强度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐方法通常只提供方向性或开放式指导，无法可靠实现精确的属性强度控制，需要开发能适应不同用户期望的精确控制方法。

Method: 将精确属性强度控制重构为目标达成问题；使用时序差分学习训练轻量级值函数预测属性强度；在隐藏表示上应用梯度干预来精确导航到特定属性强度目标。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2-3b和Phi-4-mini上的实验证实该方法能以高精度将文本生成引导到用户指定的属性强度，并在偏好数据合成、帕累托前沿近似和优化、对齐行为蒸馏三个下游任务中展示了效率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了超越简单方向对齐的细粒度连续属性强度控制，为AI系统适应多样化用户期望提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

*Junkai Zhang,Jingru Gan,Xiaoxuan Wang,Zian Jia,Changquan Gu,Jianpeng Chen,Yanqiao Zhu,Mingyu Derek Ma,Dawei Zhou,Ling Li,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MatSciBench是一个包含1340个大学水平材料科学问题的综合基准，涵盖6个主要领域和31个子领域，具有三级难度分类和多模态推理能力。评估显示即使最佳模型准确率也不到80%，表明该基准的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学推理方面表现出色，但在材料科学领域的推理能力尚未充分探索，需要建立一个全面的基准来评估和推动LLM在该领域的发展。

Method: 创建MatSciBench基准，包含1340个结构化分类的问题，采用三级难度体系，支持多模态推理。评估了多种推理策略：基础思维链、工具增强和自我修正。

Result: 即使是表现最佳的Gemini-2.5-Pro模型，在大学水平材料科学问题上的准确率也不到80%。没有单一推理方法在所有场景中都表现优异，多模态推理任务存在挑战。

Conclusion: MatSciBench为评估和提升LLM在材料科学领域的科学推理能力建立了一个全面而坚实的基准，揭示了当前模型在该领域的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

TL;DR: 本文综述了Meta AI的LLaMA系列模型（从LLaMA 1到LLaMA 4）的快速演进，以及为这些模型开发的参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，包括模型架构、性能特点和实际应用案例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language
Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA
models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度研究代理运行在'发射后不管'模式下，用户无法在执行过程中修正错误或添加专家知识，需要一种支持实时人工控制的研究框架。

Method: 采用分层规划器-执行器架构，将每个步骤写入实时'计划即文档'，通过快速通信层将每个动作、文件变更和工具调用流式传输到Web界面，用户可以随时暂停运行、编辑计划或代码、运行自定义命令并恢复。

Result: 在完全自主模式下，ResearStudio在GAIA基准测试中达到最先进结果，超越了OpenAI的DeepResearch和Manus等系统。

Conclusion: 强大的自动化性能和精细的人工控制可以共存，这为安全可控的研究代理开发提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current deep-research agents run in a ''fire-and-forget'' mode: once started,
they give users no way to fix errors or add expert knowledge during execution.
We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time
human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design.
A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live
''plan-as-document,'' a fast communication layer streams each action, file
change, and tool call to a web interface. At any moment, the user can pause the
run, edit the plan or code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching
smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In
fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the
GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These
results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control
can coexist. The full code, protocol, and evaluation scripts are available at
https://github.com/ResearAI/ResearStudio. We will continue to update the
repository to encourage further work on safe and controllable research agents.

*Pedro Domingos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了张量逻辑，一种统一神经和符号AI的基础语言，通过张量方程作为唯一构造，将逻辑规则与爱因斯坦求和统一起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展受阻于缺乏具备所有必要特性的编程语言。PyTorch、TensorFlow等库缺乏自动推理和知识获取支持，而LISP、Prolog等AI语言缺乏可扩展性和学习支持。

Method: 基于张量方程作为唯一构造，将逻辑规则与爱因斯坦求和视为相同操作，其他所有内容都可简化为这两种操作。

Result: 优雅地实现了关键形式的神经、符号和统计AI，包括变换器、形式推理、核机器和图模型。支持嵌入空间中的可靠推理。

Conclusion: 张量逻辑结合了神经网络的可扩展性和可学习性与符号推理的可靠性和透明性，可能成为AI更广泛采用的基础。

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对65个评估可解释AI(XAI)系统的用户研究进行了全面综述，提出了以人为中心的XAI系统评估框架和设计目标，并针对不同AI专业水平的用户（AI新手和数据专家）提供了扩展的设计指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，对既高性能又可理解的智能系统需求日益增长。当前XAI系统的评估过程过于技术化，缺乏对人类用户需求的关注，因此需要开展以人为中心的评估研究来指导XAI开发。

Method: 通过对65个XAI用户研究的全面综述，分析XAI系统特性和评估指标，提出以人为中心的设计目标，并根据用户AI专业水平（AI新手和数据专家）进行差异化设计。

Result: 研究发现XAI系统由核心系统和解释组件共同构成；评估指标可分为对系统的情感、认知、可用性、可解释性和解释指标；针对AI新手的设计目标包括负责任使用、接受度和可用性，针对数据专家的设计目标则侧重于性能导向、人机协作和任务表现。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了现有的XAI评估和设计框架，提供了针对不同用户群体的差异化设计指南，有助于开发更符合人类用户需求的XAI系统。

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

*Hyunji Min,Sangwon Jung,Junyoung Sung,Dosung Lee,Leekyeung Han,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GOAT是一个无需人工标注的训练框架，能够自动从API文档构建合成数据集，用于微调LLM代理处理目标导向的API执行任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在处理需要分解高级目标为多个相互依赖API调用的目标导向查询时能力有限，且缺乏训练数据。开源模型在复杂工具使用方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出GOAT训练框架，自动从API文档构建合成数据集，训练LLM代理进行目标导向的API执行，使其能够推理相互依赖的调用并生成连贯响应。

Result: GOAT训练的代理在多个现有目标导向基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在新提出的GOATBench基准测试中也表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT为构建能够进行复杂推理和工具使用的健壮开源LLM代理提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

TL;DR: 提出了MedKGEval框架，这是一个基于结构化医学知识的多轮临床LLM评估系统，通过知识图谱驱动的患者模拟和实时评估机制来改进医疗对话评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要依赖对话记录的事后审查，无法捕捉临床环境中多轮医患互动的动态性和上下文敏感性，以及患者不断变化的信息需求。

Method: 使用知识图谱驱动患者模拟，构建控制模块从知识图谱检索相关医学事实；采用实时轮次评估框架，由法官代理评估每个模型响应的临床适当性、事实准确性和安全性；整合开源资源和专家标注数据集构建知识图谱。

Result: 建立了包含8个最先进LLM的综合多轮基准测试，证明MedKGEval能够识别传统评估流程常忽略的细微行为缺陷和安全风险。

Conclusion: MedKGEval框架能够有效评估临床LLM在多轮对话中的表现，虽然最初设计用于中英文医疗应用，但可通过切换输入知识图谱轻松扩展到其他语言。

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了PromptFlow框架，通过模块化设计和元学习来自动优化提示工程，减少人工干预并提高LLM在特定任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前自动提示工程方法缺乏动态策略选择和细粒度编辑能力的问题，同时探索如何在LLM中回收经验。

Method: 采用模块化框架设计，集成元提示、操作符、优化器和评估器，使用基于梯度的元学习和强化学习来回收经验。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了PromptFlow的有效性，能够自主探索最优提示优化路径。

Conclusion: PromptFlow为自动提示工程提供了灵活高效的解决方案，显著减少了任务特定训练数据的需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出T³方法，通过检测和截断信念偏差过大的轨迹来改进LLM主动推理训练，提升训练稳定性和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在主动推理中容易出现信念偏差，导致问题状态丢失和重复无效动作，传统强化学习难以正确归因关键探索步骤

Method: T³方法跟踪模型信念偏差，检测过度偏差并截断训练轨迹，保留信息丰富的前缀部分以改善策略优化

Result: 在5个挑战性任务中，T³提升训练稳定性、token效率和最终性能，性能提升达30%，同时减少约25%的rollout token

Conclusion: 信念控制是开发鲁棒通用LLM主动推理器的关键原则

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的信息环境本质上是多模态的，包含文本、视觉元素、结构化表格和数学表达式的丰富组合。然而现有的RAG框架仅限于文本内容，在处理多模态文档时存在根本性差距。

Method: 将多模态内容重新概念化为相互连接的知识实体，而非孤立的数据类型。引入双图构建来捕获跨模态关系和文本语义的统一表示。开发跨模态混合检索，结合结构知识导航和语义匹配。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试中表现出优越性能，相比最先进方法有显著改进。在传统方法失效的长文档上性能提升尤为明显。

Conclusion: RAG-Anything为多模态知识访问建立了新范式，消除了限制当前系统的架构碎片化问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在数学研究中验证困难的问题，将AI从竞赛数学扩展到研究级数学工具，回答Terence Tao提出的关于LLM与验证器结合能否证明复杂渐近不等式的问题。

Method: 使用LLM+CAS框架和O-Forge工具，通过上下文符号反馈循环：LLM提出域分解建议，CAS（如Mathematica）对每个部分进行公理化验证。

Result: 该框架在提出适当的域分解方面表现出显著效果，能够生成既具有创造性又经过符号验证的证明，成功应用于研究级渐近分析。

Conclusion: LLM+CAS框架证明AI可以超越竞赛数学，成为专业数学家的研究级工具，为数学研究提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的发展，编程范式从代码生成辅助转向自主编码代理，催生了'Vibe Coding'这种通过观察结果而非逐行代码理解来验证AI生成实现的新开发方法。然而，这种新兴范式的有效性尚未充分探索，实证证据显示存在意外的生产力损失和人机协作挑战。

Method: 通过对1000多篇研究论文的系统分析，建立了Vibe Coding的理论基础（约束马尔可夫决策过程），并综合现有实践提出了五种开发模型：无约束自动化、迭代对话协作、规划驱动、测试驱动和上下文增强模型。

Result: 分析表明，成功的Vibe Coding不仅依赖于代理能力，更依赖于系统化的上下文工程、完善的开发环境和人机协作开发模型。

Conclusion: Vibe Coding作为一种变革性开发方法，其成功实施需要理论框架指导、系统化实践模型和优化的协作机制，为这一新兴领域提供了首个全面分类和系统指导。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PricingLogic是首个评估LLMs在旅游定价任务中可靠性的基准，包含300个基于真实定价政策的问题，测试显示LLMs在复杂折扣计算中存在系统性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游机构希望将易出错的定价任务自动化给AI系统，但未经验证的LLM部署可能导致重大财务损失和客户信任流失。

Method: 构建包含300个自然语言问题的基准，基于42个真实定价政策，分为两个难度级别：基础客户类型定价和涉及交互折扣的捆绑旅游计算。

Result: 对一系列LLMs的评估显示，在较难层级上性能急剧下降，暴露了规则解释和算术推理的系统性失败。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs具有通用能力，但在收入关键应用中仍不可靠，需要进一步的安全保障或领域适应。

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MTOS框架，将多主题环境与LLMs结合，通过记忆机制、交互策略和信念衰减机制，模拟多主题间的观点演化，显著改变了群体极化趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决社交媒体中多主题信息交互的挑战，现有研究多关注单一主题，无法捕捉跨域认知转移，传统数值模型缺乏解释性和行为一致性。

Method: MTOS框架整合LLMs与短长期记忆，采用多种用户选择交互机制、动态主题选择策略和信念衰减机制，实现跨主题观点更新。

Result: 多主题设置显著改变极化趋势：正相关主题放大回音室效应，负相关主题抑制回音室，无关主题通过资源竞争缓解回音室。相比数值模型，LLM代理能更真实模拟观点动态变化。

Conclusion: MTOS框架通过多主题与LLMs的结合，提高了模拟的解释性和系统稳定性，能捕捉复杂的人类推理过程，再现新闻文本的语言特征。

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无信号交叉口的自动驾驶决策面临复杂动态交互和高冲突风险的挑战，需要实现主动安全控制。

Method: 基于Soft Actor-Critic算法，使用偏置注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，评估车辆进入交叉口的长期碰撞风险，并将风险转化为密集奖励信号。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法有效提高了交叉口的交通效率和车辆安全性。

Conclusion: 该智能决策框架在复杂场景中具有有效性，证明了基于深度强化学习和风险预测的方法能够实现安全高效的自动驾驶决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is
available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了LLM作为评判者时的偏见问题，发现现有模型对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，但微调会显著降低性能，并提出了四种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM被广泛用于通信系统中的内容质量评估，这些AI"评判者"的公正性无法保证，其评估标准中的偏见可能扭曲结果并损害用户信任。

Method: 在点式评分设置下系统调查了两种LLM评判模型(GPT-Judge和JudgeLM)的11种偏见类型，涵盖隐式和显式形式。

Result: 发现最先进的LLM评判者对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，通常给它们分配比干净样本更低的分数；提供详细评分标准能进一步增强鲁棒性；微调LLM会显著降低性能；评判分数与任务难度相关。

Conclusion: 提出了四种潜在的缓解策略，以确保在实际通信场景中实现公平可靠的AI评判。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于有向无环图的任务导向医疗对话框架，包含问题转换、冷启动、自适应分支、终止逻辑和报告生成等功能，在初步评估中表现出低认知负荷、高可用性和用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为医疗领域开发一个系统化的任务导向对话系统，能够将医疗算法和指南转化为结构化问诊流程，提高临床工作效率并减少认知负担。

Method: 采用有向无环图结构组织医疗问题，包含五个核心机制：问题转换管道、基于层次聚类的冷启动、扩展剪枝的自适应分支、终止逻辑和结构化报告生成。

Result: 患者应用：NASA-TLX=15.6（低负荷），SUS=86（高可用性），QUIS=8.1/9（高满意度）；医生应用：NASA-TLX=26（中等负荷），SUS=88.5（优秀可用性），QUIS=8.3/9（高满意度）。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效集成到临床工作流程中，降低认知需求并支持高效报告生成，但存在系统延迟和小样本评估的局限性。

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI虚拟细胞模型在跨实验室和平台的可迁移性有限，存在数据泄露和覆盖偏差问题，且剂量、时间和组合效应尚未系统处理。跨尺度耦合受限，分子、细胞和组织水平的锚点稀疏。

Method: 采用模型无关的CSL视角，通过测量、提升/投影（跨尺度耦合）和干预（剂量和调度）的操作符语法组织学习。强调操作符感知的数据设计、抗泄露分区和透明校准。

Result: 提出了决策对齐的评估框架，重点关注功能空间读数，如通路活性、空间邻域和临床相关终点。

Conclusion: 建议采用操作符感知的数据设计、抗泄露分区和透明校准报告，以实现可重复的同类比较，促进AI虚拟细胞模型的实际应用。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

TL;DR: ProtoSiTex是一个半可解释框架，用于细粒度多标签文本分类，通过双阶段交替训练策略学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，实现最先进性能并提供忠实的人类对齐解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户生成评论激增需要可解释模型提供细粒度洞察。现有基于原型的模型在粗粒度（句子或文档级）操作，无法处理真实世界文本分类的多标签性质。

Method: 采用双阶段交替训练策略：无监督原型发现阶段学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，监督分类阶段将这些原型映射到类别标签。使用分层损失函数在子句、句子和文档级别强制一致性。

Result: 在酒店评论基准数据集和两个公共基准测试（二分类和多分类）上的实验表明，ProtoSiTex实现了最先进的性能，同时提供忠实的人类对齐解释。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex通过自适应原型和多头注意力捕获重叠和冲突语义，为半可解释多标签文本分类提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

Motivation: 受自然选择中竞争与合作力量驱动智力演化的启发，旨在创建能模拟生物进化社会动态的多智能体系统，超越传统的二元团队结构。

Method: 为每个智能体分配基因型，设计基于包容性适应度的奖励函数，基因材料可在智能体间共享，在囚徒困境网络游戏中研究社会动态。

Result: 实验结果与汉密尔顿法则等生物学原理一致，展示了基于基因相似度的合作谱系，能够产生独特的非团队社会动态。

Conclusion: 基于包容性适应度的奖励机制为更高级战略智能和社交智能的出现提供了基础，可扩展到具有时空结构、有限资源和演化种群的开放环境。

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注9x9数独等流行谜题，存在过拟合规范格式和记忆解模式的风险，无法评估模型对新规则的理解和策略适应能力。

Method: 通过三个维度系统化转换规范谜题：增加复杂性(IC)、不常见元素(UE)、不可解谜题(UP)，减少对捷径记忆的依赖。

Result: 评估显示即使在其他基准测试中表现优异的模型也出现显著性能下降，表明模型严重依赖记忆的刻板模式。增加复杂性是主要困难来源，但模型在细微规则变化上也表现不佳。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic揭示了当前大型推理模型的局限性，为推进高级逻辑推理建立了基准测试。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Conclusion: 将内存管理作为可学习的内在能力进行端到端优化，能够有效提升智能体在长视野任务中的表现和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Motivation: 解决高性能具身AI系统依赖昂贵大型模型，而小型模型缺乏必要知识和技能的问题。

Method: 第一阶段：具身先验学习，从轨迹增强先验、环境锚定先验和外部知识先验中提取知识；第二阶段：在线强化学习，包含自总结、密集奖励塑造和回合级策略优化。

Result: ERA-3B在EB-ALFRED任务上比GPT-4o提升8.4%，在EB-Manipulation任务上提升19.4%，并在未见任务上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ERA为可扩展的具身智能提供了实用路径，为未来具身AI系统提供了方法论见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM作为法官的方法依赖简单聚合（如多数投票），但即使个体智能体给出正确答案，这种方法也可能失败。需要更有效的协作判断机制。

Method: 设计多智能体辩论框架，智能体协作推理并迭代优化回答。引入稳定性检测机制，通过时变Beta-Binomial混合模型建模法官共识动态，基于分布相似性（K-S检验）自适应停止。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上的实验表明，该框架相比多数投票提高了判断准确性，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论框架能有效提升LLM自动判断任务的性能，通过协作推理和自适应停止机制实现更好的准确性和效率平衡。

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶、交通和医疗等安全关键系统中，AI系统需要在各种条件下保持可靠性能，包括处理分布外样本、对抗攻击和环境变化，系统故障可能带来严重后果。

Method: 结合自监督学习原则和图论技术，从无标记数据中学习有用表示，从而更有效地识别和分类OOD样本。

Result: 与现有最先进方法相比，该方法在AUROC指标上达到0.99。

Conclusion: 该方法成功提高了AI系统的鲁棒性，特别是在OOD检测方面，且无需依赖标记数据。

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =
0.99.

TL;DR: CLUTCH是一种基于深度组合多臂老虎机的新型JavaScript模糊测试方法，通过注意力机制和Concrete Dropout动态选择变异目标，相比现有方法提高了测试用例有效性和覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有JavaScript模糊测试方法使用随机选择进行代码变异，效率较低。作者认为选择更好的变异目标适合使用组合多臂老虎机方法来解决。

Method: 提出CLUTCH深度组合多臂老虎机，使用注意力机制处理可变长度的JavaScript测试用例表示，并通过Concrete Dropout动态调整探索策略。

Result: CLUTCH相比三种最先进方法，平均提高有效测试用例数量20.3%，每个测试用例覆盖率8.9%。在波动和组合设置中，遗憾值分别减少至少78.1%和4.1%。

Conclusion: CLUTCH在JavaScript模糊测试中显著提高了效率，证明了组合多臂老虎机方法在代码变异目标选择中的有效性。

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CTRL-Rec是一种允许用户通过自然语言实时控制推荐系统的方法，通过LLM模拟用户对推荐项目的判断，训练嵌入模型来近似这些判断，并将其集成到传统推荐系统的信号加权中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户对推荐系统不满意时，他们通常缺乏细粒度的控制手段来改变推荐结果。大型语言模型提供了通过自然语言请求来指导推荐的可能性。

Method: 在训练阶段使用LLM模拟用户基于语言请求对项目的批准判断，训练嵌入模型来近似这些模拟判断，然后将这些基于用户请求的预测集成到传统推荐系统的标准信号加权中。部署时每个用户请求只需一次LLM嵌入计算。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种请求下都能实现细粒度控制。在19名Letterboxd用户的研究中，CTRL-Rec受到用户积极评价，与传统控制相比显著增强了用户的控制感和满意度。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec方法成功实现了通过自然语言实时控制推荐系统，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了用户体验和控制感。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

TL;DR: Ax-Prover是一个基于多智能体系统的自动定理证明器，能够在Lean中解决跨科学领域的问题，既可以自主运行，也可以与人类专家协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学问题需要结合创造性推理和严格的形式化验证，传统专用证明器难以泛化到不同领域。

Method: 通过模型上下文协议（MCP）为大型语言模型配备Lean工具，将LLM的知识推理能力与形式化验证工具相结合。

Result: 在公共数学基准测试中与最先进证明器竞争，在新引入的抽象代数和量子理论基准测试中表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于工具的多智能体定理证明方法为跨科学领域的形式化验证提供了可泛化的解决方案，并成功协助专家数学家完成复杂密码学定理的形式化证明。

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有日内电价概率预测研究依赖特定领域特征（如VWAP和最后价格），但订单簿中的丰富信息未被充分探索，且现有方法通常在单一国家和产品类型上开发，缺乏泛化性验证。

Method: 从订单簿提取384个特征，通过特征选择识别有效特征集，使用经典统计模型、树集成方法和深度学习模型在德国和奥地利的60分钟和15分钟产品上进行综合基准测试。

Result: 建立了跨国家和产品类型的综合基准，识别出有效的订单簿特征，并揭示了模型在跨国家和产品类型泛化时存在不对称现象。

Conclusion: 订单簿特征对日内电价预测具有重要价值，但模型泛化能力存在不对称性，需要在不同市场环境下谨慎评估模型性能。

Abstract: Accurate probabilistic forecasting of intraday electricity prices is critical
for market participants to inform trading decisions. Existing studies rely on
specific domain features, such as Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and the
last price. However, the rich information in the orderbook remains
underexplored. Furthermore, these approaches are often developed within a
single country and product type, making it unclear whether the approaches are
generalizable. In this paper, we extract 384 features from the orderbook and
identify a set of powerful features via feature selection. Based on selected
features, we present a comprehensive benchmark using classical statistical
models, tree-based ensembles, and deep learning models across two countries
(Germany and Austria) and two product types (60-min and 15-min). We further
perform a systematic generalization study across countries and product types,
from which we reveal an asymmetric generalization phenomenon.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文研究了单层注意力风格模型中成对交互学习的最小化收敛率，证明了收敛率仅依赖于激活函数的平滑度β，与token数量、环境维度或权重矩阵秩无关，揭示了注意力机制在维度无关统计效率方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力风格模型中成对交互学习的统计效率，特别关注其是否受到token数量、环境维度或权重矩阵秩等参数的影响，为理解注意力机制的理论基础提供支撑。

Method: 通过理论分析证明单层注意力风格模型（token通过权重矩阵和非线性激活函数交互）的最小化收敛率，建立数学框架分析统计效率。

Result: 证明了最小化收敛率为M^{-2β/(2β+1)}，其中M为样本大小，β为激活函数平滑度，该收敛率与token数量、环境维度、权重矩阵秩无关，体现了维度无关的统计效率。

Conclusion: 注意力风格的非局部模型具有基本的维度无关统计效率，即使权重矩阵和激活函数不可单独识别，这为理解注意力机制及其训练提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study the convergence rate of learning pairwise interactions in
single-layer attention-style models, where tokens interact through a weight
matrix and a non-linear activation function. We prove that the minimax rate is
$M^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta+1}}$ with $M$ being the sample size, depending only
on the smoothness $\beta$ of the activation, and crucially independent of token
count, ambient dimension, or rank of the weight matrix. These results highlight
a fundamental dimension-free statistical efficiency of attention-style nonlocal
models, even when the weight matrix and activation are not separately
identifiable and provide a theoretical understanding of the attention mechanism
and its training.

TL;DR: 论文研究了贝叶斯优化中忽略双边不确定性(BU)的实践影响，发现虽然精确方法性能更好，但差异在实际应用中不显著，支持了BU忽略近似在实践中的充分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化中的加性假设虽然能缓解高维建模和搜索的困难，但常用采集函数忽略了维度间的双边不确定性，这种近似在小预算情况下的实际影响尚不清楚。

Method: 利用条件独立性，开发了尊重双边不确定性的Thompson采样方法，并进行了实证研究比较精确方法与加性近似的性能差异。

Result: 加性近似的Thompson采样确实比精确方法性能稍差，但这种差异在实际应用中并不显著。

Conclusion: 研究支持了理论理解，表明即使在非渐近情况下，忽略双边不确定性的近似方法在实践中已经足够使用。

Abstract: In Bayesian Optimization (BO), additive assumptions can mitigate the twin
difficulties of modeling and searching a complex function in high dimension.
However, common acquisition functions, like the Additive Lower Confidence
Bound, ignore pairwise covariances between dimensions, which we'll call
\textit{bilateral uncertainty} (BU), imposing a second layer of approximations.
While theoretical results indicate that asymptotically not much is lost in
doing so, little is known about the practical effects of this assumption in
small budgets. In this article, we show that by exploiting conditional
independence, Thompson Sampling respecting BU can be efficiently conducted. We
use this fact to execute an empirical investigation into the loss incurred by
ignoring BU, finding that the additive approximation to Thompson Sampling does
indeed have, on balance, worse performance than the exact method, but that this
difference is of little practical significance. This buttresses the theoretical
understanding and suggests that the BU-ignoring approximation is sufficient for
BO in practice, even in the non-asymptotic regime.

Conclusion: 提出的希尔伯特空间主动子空间分析方法能够有效处理无限维问题，在可视化和优化建模中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Active subspace analysis uses the leading eigenspace of the gradient's second
moment to conduct supervised dimension reduction. In this article, we extend
this methodology to real-valued functionals on Hilbert space. We define an
operator which coincides with the active subspace matrix when applied to a
Euclidean space. We show that many of the desirable properties of Active
Subspace analysis extend directly to the infinite dimensional setting. We also
propose a Monte Carlo procedure and discuss its convergence properties.
Finally, we deploy this methodology to create visualizations and improve

Motivation: 传统LDP分析通常关注期望性能，但在实际应用中需要高概率保证。此外，用户可能具有不同的隐私需求，这需要开发能够处理异构隐私级别的算法。

Method: 针对一维和多维均值估计问题，开发了具有高概率保证的有限样本上界；对于分布学习，设计了在ℓ∞距离下处理异构隐私需求的算法。

Result: 建立了在异构LDP机制下的最优有限样本上界，并通过匹配的极小极大下界证明了结果的紧致性，为具有用户特定隐私级别的场景提供了理论指导。

Conclusion: 本文为异构局部差分隐私设置提供了系统的理论框架和算法设计原则，填补了高概率保证分析在异构隐私需求下的空白。

Abstract: We study statistical estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) when
users may hold heterogeneous privacy levels and accuracy must be guaranteed
with high probability. Departing from the common in-expectation analyses, and
for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional mean estimation problems, we develop
finite sample upper bounds in $\ell_2$-norm that hold with probability at least
$1-\beta$. We complement these results with matching minimax lower bounds,
establishing the optimality (up to constants) of our guarantees in the
heterogeneous LDP regime. We further study distribution learning in
$\ell_\infty$-distance, designing an algorithm with high-probability guarantees
under heterogeneous privacy demands. Our techniques offer principled guidance

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为最优传输中的低秩结构恢复提供了一个统一且理论完备的方法，在理论和实践层面都表现出良好性能。

Abstract: We propose a new general framework for recovering low-rank structure in
optimal transport using Schatten-$p$ norm regularization. Our approach extends
existing methods that promote sparse and interpretable transport maps or plans,
while providing a unified and principled family of convex programs that
encourage low-dimensional structure. The convexity of our formulation enables
direct theoretical analysis: we derive optimality conditions and prove recovery
guarantees for low-rank couplings and barycentric maps in simplified settings.
To efficiently solve the proposed program, we develop a mirror descent
algorithm with convergence guarantees for $p \geq 1$. Experiments on synthetic
and real data demonstrate the method's efficiency, scalability, and ability to
recover low-rank transport structures.

Conclusion: 提出的框架不仅填补了SGD理论的关键空白，还为分析广泛的高维学习算法提供了新的工具包。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its Ruppert-Polyak averaged variant
(ASGD) lie at the heart of modern large-scale learning, yet their theoretical
properties in high-dimensional settings are rarely understood. In this paper,
we provide rigorous statistical guarantees for constant learning-rate SGD and
ASGD in high-dimensional regimes. Our key innovation is to transfer powerful
tools from high-dimensional time series to online learning. Specifically, by
viewing SGD as a nonlinear autoregressive process and adapting existing
coupling techniques, we prove the geometric-moment contraction of
high-dimensional SGD for constant learning rates, thereby establishing
asymptotic stationarity of the iterates. Building on this, we derive the $q$-th
moment convergence of SGD and ASGD for any $q\ge2$ in general $\ell^s$-norms,
and, in particular, the $\ell^{\infty}$-norm that is frequently adopted in
high-dimensional sparse or structured models. Furthermore, we provide sharp
high-probability concentration analysis which entails the probabilistic bound
of high-dimensional ASGD. Beyond closing a critical gap in SGD theory, our
proposed framework offers a novel toolkit for analyzing a broad class of
high-dimensional learning algorithms.

Abstract: We study neural network compressibility by using singular learning theory to
extend the minimum description length (MDL) principle to singular models like

Motivation: 解决解耦多臂老虎机问题，其中学习者在每轮选择一个探索臂（观察损失但不计入）和一个利用臂（产生损失但不观察），旨在实现随机和对抗环境下的最优性能。

Method: 在FTPL框架中使用帕累托扰动，避免了之前方法所需的凸优化步骤和重采样步骤，从而显著提高计算效率。

Result: 在随机环境中实现常数遗憾（优于标准MAB的最优界限），在对抗环境中实现极小极大最优遗憾，计算速度比Decoupled-Tsallis-INF快约20倍，且实证性能更好。

Conclusion: 该方法在解耦MAB问题中实现了最佳性能，计算效率显著提升，并证明纯探索策略或简单组合探索与利用策略是次优的。

Abstract: We study the decoupled multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where the learner
selects one arm for exploration and one arm for exploitation in each round. The
loss of the explored arm is observed but not counted, while the loss of the
exploited arm is incurred without being observed. We propose a policy within
the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) framework using Pareto perturbations.
Our policy achieves (near-)optimal regret regardless of the environment, i.e.,
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW): constant regret in the stochastic regime, improving
upon the optimal bound of the standard MABs, and minimax optimal regret in the
adversarial regime. Moreover, the practicality of our policy stems from
avoiding both the convex optimization step required by the previous BOBW
policy, Decoupled-Tsallis-INF (Rouyer & Seldin, 2020), and the resampling step
that is typically necessary in FTPL. Consequently, it achieves substantial
computational improvement, about $20$ times faster than Decoupled-Tsallis-INF,
while also demonstrating better empirical performance in both regimes. Finally,
we empirically show that our approach outperforms a pure exploration policy,
and that naively combining a pure exploration with a standard exploitation
policy is suboptimal.

Abstract: In this paper, we refine the Berry-Esseen bounds for the multivariate normal
approximation of Polyak-Ruppert averaged iterates arising from the linear
stochastic approximation (LSA) algorithm with decreasing step size. We consider
the normal approximation by the Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix
predicted by the Polyak-Juditsky central limit theorem and establish the rate
up to order $n^{-1/3}$ in convex distance, where $n$ is the number of samples
used in the algorithm. We also prove a non-asymptotic validity of the
multiplier bootstrap procedure for approximating the distribution of the
rescaled error of the averaged LSA estimator. We establish approximation rates
of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$ for the latter distribution, which significantly
improves upon the previous results obtained by Samsonov et al. (2024).

*Alvaro Ortiz,Tomasa Rodrigo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文构建了42个国家的高频新闻情绪指标数据集，研究了地缘政治风险、经济政策不确定性等情绪指标对主权风险的影响及其预测价值，发现机器学习方法能显著提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主权风险分析主要依赖全球货币政策等传统驱动因素，缺乏对新闻情绪指标的关注。本文旨在研究新闻情绪动态如何影响主权风险，并评估其相对于传统因素的预测价值。

Method: 构建高频日度面板数据集，包含42个国家的地缘政治风险、经济政策不确定性等新闻指标；采用赛马分析比较不同预测模型，特别使用随机森林等非线性机器学习方法。

Result: 新闻情绪指标显著提升主权风险预测精度，随机森林方法效果最佳；全球金融变量仍是主要驱动因素，但地缘政治风险和经济政策不确定性也起重要作用，且与全球金融条件存在非线性交互效应；不同地区和新兴市场对政策利率、金融波动和地缘政治风险的敏感性存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 新闻情绪指标对主权风险具有重要预测价值，机器学习方法能有效捕捉非线性关系，政策制定者和投资者应关注新闻情绪动态，特别是新兴市场对各类风险冲击的敏感性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel high-frequency daily panel dataset of both markets and
news-based indicators -- including Geopolitical Risk, Economic Policy
Uncertainty, Trade Policy Uncertainty, and Political Sentiment -- for 42
countries across both emerging and developed markets. Using this dataset, we
study how sentiment dynamics shape sovereign risk, measured by Credit Default
Swap (CDS) spreads, and evaluate their forecasting value relative to
traditional drivers such as global monetary policy and market volatility. Our
horse-race analysis of forecasting models demonstrates that incorporating
news-based indicators significantly enhances predictive accuracy and enriches
the analysis, with non-linear machine learning methods -- particularly Random
Forests -- delivering the largest gains. Our analysis reveals that while global
financial variables remain the dominant drivers of sovereign risk, geopolitical
risk and economic policy uncertainty also play a meaningful role. Crucially,
their effects are amplified through non-linear interactions with global
financial conditions. Finally, we document pronounced regional heterogeneity,
as certain asset classes and emerging markets exhibit heightened sensitivity to
shocks in policy rates, global financial volatility, and geopolitical risk.

Motivation: 解决机器学习中模型利用数据中伪相关性的问题，避免依赖预定义环境，实现自适应环境发现

Method: UAED框架学习数据变换的分布来实例化环境，优化鲁棒目标在该分布上的平均值，无需手动设计环境或预定义组

Result: 在标准基准测试中提高了最坏情况准确率，同时保持平均准确率的竞争力，发现了可解释的环境分布

Conclusion: 使环境自适应是实现分布外泛化的实用途径

Abstract: An open problem in Machine Learning is how to avoid models to exploit
spurious correlations in the data; a famous example is the background-label
shortcut in the Waterbirds dataset. A common remedy is to train a model across
multiple environments; in the Waterbirds dataset, this corresponds to training
by randomizing the background. However, selecting the right environments is a
challenging problem, given that these are rarely known a priori. We propose
Universal Adaptive Environment Discovery (UAED), a unified framework that
learns a distribution over data transformations that instantiate environments,
and optimizes any robust objective averaged over this learned distribution.
UAED yields adaptive variants of IRM, REx, GroupDRO, and CORAL without
predefined groups or manual environment design. We provide a theoretical
analysis by providing PAC-Bayes bounds and by showing robustness to test
environment distributions under standard conditions. Empirically, UAED
discovers interpretable environment distributions and improves worst-case
accuracy on standard benchmarks, while remaining competitive on mean accuracy.
Our results indicate that making environments adaptive is a practical route to
out-of-distribution generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越传统的扩散过程，构建更灵活的一维噪声过程生成模型框架，使噪声过程本身可学习以适应数据特性。

Method: 通过分位数函数参数化噪声分布，使一维噪声过程可学习，能够无缝集成Flow Matching和一致性模型等标准目标。

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for constructing generative models using
one-dimensional noising processes. Beyond diffusion processes, we outline
examples that demonstrate the flexibility of our approach. Motivated by this,
we propose a novel framework in which the 1D processes themselves are
learnable, achieved by parameterizing the noise distribution through quantile
functions that adapt to the data. Our construction integrates seamlessly with
standard objectives, including Flow Matching and consistency models. Learning
quantile-based noise naturally captures heavy tails and compact supports when
present. Numerical experiments highlight both the flexibility and the
effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Sinkhorn算法在有限正则化参数下的镜像下降性质，给出了L^2收缩准则，推导了熵产生率的精确表达式，证明了Sinkhorn流诱导的马尔可夫动力学的可逆性和谱间隙严格正性，并建立了与对数Sobolev不等式的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Sinkhorn算法在有限正则化参数下的动力学性质，揭示其与镜像下降、扩散过程和梯度流的深层联系，为算法分析和应用提供理论基础。

Method: 使用镜像Hessian诱导的时间依赖度量分析L^2收缩性，推导熵产生率的精确表达式，建立Sinkhorn流与Onsager梯度流的关系，定义Dirichlet形式并证明Poincaré不等式。

Result: 证明了Sinkhorn流在有限正则化参数下具有严格正的谱间隙，熵衰减是指数级的当且仅当满足对数Sobolev不等式，并给出了两个实际应用案例。

Conclusion: Sinkhorn算法在有限正则化参数下具有丰富的动力学性质，其分析框架可系统扩展到Sinkhorn流，为生成模型训练和离散算法停止准则提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Recently, the vanishing-step-size limit of the Sinkhorn algorithm at finite
regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ was shown to be a mirror descent in the
space of probability measures. We give $L^2$ contraction criteria in two
time-dependent metrics induced by the mirror Hessian, which reduce to the
coercivity of certain conditional expectation operators. We then give an exact
identity for the entropy production rate of the Sinkhorn flow, which was
previously known only to be nonpositive. Examining this rate shows that the
standard semigroup analysis of diffusion processes extends systematically to
the Sinkhorn flow. We show that the flow induces a reversible Markov dynamics
on the target marginal as an Onsager gradient flow. We define the Dirichlet
form associated to its (nonlocal) infinitesimal generator, prove a Poincar\'e
inequality for it, and show that the spectral gap is strictly positive along
the Sinkhorn flow whenever $\varepsilon > 0$. Lastly, we show that the entropy
decay is exponential if and only if a logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI)
holds. We give for illustration two immediate practical use-cases for the
Sinkhorn LSI: as a design principle for the latent space in which generative
models are trained, and as a stopping heuristic for discrete-time algorithms.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的统计框架来解决软最大门控高斯混合专家模型(SGMoE)中的三个长期障碍：参数不可识别性、门控-专家交互耦合以及软最大条件密度的紧密耦合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SGMoE模型中长期存在的参数估计和模型选择障碍，包括门控参数的非可识别性、门控-专家交互的耦合效应，以及软最大条件密度的计算复杂性。

Method: 引入Voronoi型损失函数与门控分区几何对齐，建立最大似然估计的有限样本收敛率，在过参数化模型中揭示MLE收敛率与多项式方程系统可解性的联系，并采用混合测度的树状图进行模型选择。

Result: 在合成数据上准确恢复专家数量并达到预测的参数估计率，在模型误设情况下树状图选择标准具有鲁棒性，在玉米蛋白质组学数据集上选择两个专家并优于标准准则。

Conclusion: 该框架为SGMoE提供了统一的统计基础，解决了参数估计和模型选择的关键问题，树状图方法在避免多尺寸训练的同时实现了点最优参数率。

Abstract: We develop a unified statistical framework for softmax-gated Gaussian mixture
of experts (SGMoE) that addresses three long-standing obstacles in parameter
estimation and model selection: (i) non-identifiability of gating parameters up
to common translations, (ii) intrinsic gate-expert interactions that induce
coupled differential relations in the likelihood, and (iii) the tight
numerator-denominator coupling in the softmax-induced conditional density. Our
approach introduces Voronoi-type loss functions aligned with the gate-partition
geometry and establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE). In over-specified models, we reveal a link between
the MLE's convergence rate and the solvability of an associated system of
polynomial equations characterizing near-nonidentifiable directions. For model
selection, we adapt dendrograms of mixing measures to SGMoE, yielding a
consistent, sweep-free selector of the number of experts that attains
pointwise-optimal parameter rates under overfitting while avoiding multi-size
training. Simulations on synthetic data corroborate the theory, accurately
recovering the expert count and achieving the predicted rates for parameter
estimation while closely approximating the regression function. Under model
misspecification (e.g., $\epsilon$-contamination), the dendrogram selection
criterion is robust, recovering the true number of mixture components, while
the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and the
integrated completed likelihood tend to overselect as sample size grows. On a
maize proteomics dataset of drought-responsive traits, our dendrogram-guided
SGMoE selects two experts, exposes a clear mixing-measure hierarchy, stabilizes
the likelihood early, and yields interpretable genotype-phenotype maps,
outperforming standard criteria without multi-size training.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了约束均值场博弈(CMFG)框架，将约束马尔可夫决策过程(CMDP)引入均值场博弈，扩展了经典MFG模型以处理可行性、安全性和监管限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均值场博弈模型无法处理具有约束条件的多智能体系统，需要扩展以捕捉现实世界中智能体策略受到可行性、安全或监管限制的场景。

Method: 开发了约束均值场占用测度优化(CMFOMO)方法，通过参数化占用测度将CMFG均衡求解转化为具有凸约束和边界变量的单优化问题。

Result: 证明了CMFG均衡在严格可行性假设下的存在性，在单调性条件下的唯一性，并证明了CMFG均衡可诱导约束N人博弈中的O(1/√N)-纳什均衡。

Conclusion: CMFG框架有效扩展了经典MFG模型，CMFOMO方法能够近似所有均衡且不依赖均衡唯一性，数值实验验证了该框架在带约束流行病模型中的有效性和灵活性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework of Constrained Mean-Field Games (CMFGs),
where each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). This
formulation captures scenarios in which agents' strategies are subject to
feasibility, safety, or regulatory restrictions, thereby extending the scope of
classical mean field game (MFG) models. We first establish the existence of
CMFG equilibria under a strict feasibility assumption, and we further show
uniqueness under a classical monotonicity condition. To compute equilibria, we
develop Constrained Mean-Field Occupation Measure Optimization (CMFOMO), an
optimization-based scheme that parameterizes occupation measures and shows that
finding CMFG equilibria is equivalent to solving a single optimization problem
with convex constraints and bounded variables. CMFOMO does not rely on
uniqueness of the equilibria and can approximate all equilibria with arbitrary
accuracy. We further prove that CMFG equilibria induce $O(1 / \sqrt{N})$-Nash
equilibria in the associated constrained $N$-player games, thereby extending
the classical justification of MFGs as approximations for large but finite
systems. Numerical experiments on a modified Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible
(SIS) epidemic model with various constraints illustrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of the framework.

Motivation: 传统鞍点问题通常需要强凸-强凹假设，这限制了问题的适用范围。作者希望开发更宽松的条件来涵盖更广泛的问题类别，同时保持高效的收敛性能。

Method: 提出了广义加速原始对偶(GAPD)算法，该算法统一并扩展了现有方法，能够处理非双线性目标函数的鞍点问题。

Result: 证明了在双向QFG或QGG条件下，GAPD算法能够实现线性收敛率，并且提供了满足这些条件的结构化鞍点问题实例。

Conclusion: 所提出的QFG和QGG条件成功放宽了传统要求，GAPD算法在这些放松条件下仍能保持线性收敛，扩展了鞍点问题的可解范围。

Abstract: In this paper, we study saddle point (SP) problems, focusing on
convex-concave optimization involving functions that satisfy either two-sided
quadratic functional growth (QFG) or two-sided quadratic gradient growth
(QGG)--novel conditions tailored specifically for SP problems as extensions of
quadratic growth conditions in minimization. These conditions relax the
traditional requirement of strong convexity-strong concavity, thereby
encompassing a broader class of problems. We propose a generalized accelerated
primal-dual (GAPD) algorithm to solve SP problems with non-bilinear objective
functions, unifying and extending existing methods. We prove that our method
achieves a linear convergence rate under these relaxed conditions.
Additionally, we provide examples of structured SP problems that satisfy either
two-sided QFG or QGG, demonstrating the practical applicability and relevance
of our approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于场景的随机MPC在应对水电-风光混合系统实时调度时面临严重计算瓶颈，需要解决时间、资产和场景三个维度的复杂性。

Method: 将时间序列聚合(TSA)专门应用于MPC预测时域的尾部以保持实时精度，同时采用分布式优化实现跨资产和场景的分解，并提供理论验证的近似误差界限保证。

Result: 在实际案例研究中，该控制器相比集中式全规模MPC实现了42%的执行时间减少，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的控制方案成功解决了混合能源系统实时调度的计算挑战，在保证性能的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: This paper addresses the real-time energy dispatch of a hybrid system
comprising cascaded hydropower plants, wind, and solar units, jointly
participating in the day-ahead energy market under inflow, renewable
generation, and price uncertainties. Traditional scenario-based stochastic
model predictive control (MPC) faces severe computational bottlenecks due to
the complexity arising from the temporal, asset, and scenario dimensions of
this control problem. To address this, we propose a novel control scheme that
combines time series aggregation (TSA) with distributed stochastic MPC. TSA is
applied exclusively to the tail of the MPC prediction horizon to preserve
real-time accuracy, while distributed optimization enables decomposition across
assets and scenarios. Notably, the controller offers a formal performance
guarantee through theoretically validated bounds on its approximation error.
Simulations on a real-world case study confirm the controller's effectiveness,
achieving a 42% reduction in execution time compared to centralized full-scale
MPC.

Abstract: Semi-Infinite Programming (SIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
modeling problems with infinite constraints, however, its theoretical
development in the context of nonconvex and large-scale optimization remains
limited. In this paper, we investigate a class of nonconvex min-max
optimization problems with nonconvex infinite constraints, motivated by
applications such as adversarial robustness and safety-constrained learning. We
propose a novel inexact dynamic barrier primal-dual algorithm and establish its
convergence properties. Specifically, under the assumption that the squared
infeasibility residual function satisfies the Lojasiewicz inequality with
exponent $\theta \in (0,1)$, we prove that the proposed method achieves
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$, $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-6\theta})$, and
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3\theta/(1-\theta)})$ iteration complexities to achieve
an $\epsilon$-approximate stationarity, infeasibility, and complementarity
slackness, respectively. Numerical experiments on robust multitask learning
with task priority further illustrate the practical effectiveness of the
algorithm.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效解决一类广泛的非单调变分不等式问题，为纳什均衡、交通控制和GAN模型等应用提供了可行的计算框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the local linear convergence behavior of
proximal-gradient (PG) descent algorithm on a parameterized gap-function
reformulation of a smooth but non-monotone variational inequality problem
(VIP). The aim is to solve the non-monotone VI problem without assuming the
existence of a Minty-type solution. We first introduce and study various error
bound conditions for the gap functions in relation to the VI model. In
particular, we show that uniform type error bounds imply level-set type error
bounds for composite optimization, revealing a key hierarchical structure
there. As a result, local linear convergence is established under some
easy-verifiable conditions induced by level-set error bounds, the gradient
Lipschitz condition and a suitable initialization condition. Furthermore, for
non-monotone affine VIs we present a homotopy continuation scheme that achieves
global convergence by dynamically tracing a solution path. Our numerical
experiments show the efficacy of the proposed approach, leading to the
solutions of a broad class of non-monotone VI problems resulting from the need
to compute Nash equilibria, traffic controls, and the GAN models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在放松管制的电力市场中，配电公司部署的电池储能常常闲置，因为监管约束禁止其参与电力市场。

Method: 开发了一个包含市场参与约束的储能投资和运营规划优化框架。

Result: 市场参与可带来与峰值需求削减相当的节省；在当前条件下市场参与不会增加储能投资，但在极低储能成本下可能激励超出本地配电需求的部署。

Conclusion: 该框架可以识别适合本地配电需求的投资水平，但储能大规模市场参与可能与放松管制市场中配电与发电分离的原则相冲突。

Abstract: Electricity distribution companies deploy battery storage to defer grid
upgrades by reducing peak demand. In deregulated jurisdictions, such storage
often sits idle because regulatory constraints bar participation in electricity
markets. Here, we develop an optimization framework that, to our knowledge,
provides the first formal model of market participation constraints within
storage investment and operation planning. Applying the framework to a
Massachusetts case study, we find that market participation could deliver
similar savings as peak demand reduction. Under current conditions, market
participation does not increase storage investment, but at very low storage
costs, could incentivize deployment beyond local distribution needs. This might
run contrary to the separation of distribution from generation in deregulated
markets. Our framework can identify investment levels appropriate for local
distribution needs.

Conclusion: MFAC框架在计算平均场博弈均衡方面是有效的，结果突出了actor、critic和分布组件之间的算法相互作用。

Abstract: We propose the Mean-Field Actor-Critic (MFAC) flow, a continuous-time
learning dynamics for solving mean-field games (MFGs), combining techniques
from reinforcement learning and optimal transport. The MFAC framework jointly
evolves the control (actor), value function (critic), and distribution
components through coupled gradient-based updates governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs). A central innovation is the Optimal Transport
Geodesic Picard (OTGP) flow, which drives the distribution toward equilibrium
along Wasserstein-2 geodesics. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis using
Lyapunov functionals and establish global exponential convergence of the MFAC
flow under a suitable timescale. Our results highlight the algorithmic
interplay among actor, critic, and distribution components. Numerical
experiments illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the MFAC framework in computing MFG equilibria.

Motivation: 机会约束规划在处理不确定性优化问题时很强大，但面临非凸约束和分布未知的挑战，需要开发能处理广泛CCP问题且不依赖精确分布的方法。

Method: 将CCP重构为两个分布的采样问题：未知数据分布和Boltzmann分布，利用一阶和二阶梯度信息，通过前向扩散注入噪声凸化非凸可行域，然后进行引导反向采样。

Result: 在合成数据集和无线通信波形设计任务上的实验表明，GGDOpt在解质量和稳定性上优于现有方法，开销减少近80%。

Conclusion: GGDOpt提供了一个理论收敛保证和实践误差界的框架，能有效处理非凸机会约束规划问题，具有广泛适用性和优越性能。

Abstract: Chance constrained programming (CCP) is a powerful framework for addressing
optimization problems under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Gradient-Guided Diffusion-based Optimization framework, termed GGDOpt, which
tackles CCP through three key innovations. First, GGDOpt accommodates a broad
class of CCP problems without requiring the knowledge of the exact distribution
of uncertainty-relying solely on a set of samples. Second, to address the
nonconvexity of the chance constraints, it reformulates the CCP as a sampling
problem over the product of two distributions: an unknown data distribution
supported on a nonconvex set and a Boltzmann distribution defined by the
objective function, which fully leverages both first- and second-order gradient
information. Third, GGDOpt has theoretical convergence guarantees and provides
practical error bounds under mild assumptions. By progressively injecting noise
during the forward diffusion process to convexify the nonconvex feasible
region, GGDOpt enables guided reverse sampling to generate asymptotically
optimal solutions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and a waveform
design task in wireless communications demonstrate that GGDOpt outperforms
existing methods in both solution quality and stability with nearly 80%
overhead reduction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个几何框架，扩展了凸分析结果，超越了标准限定条件（如相对内部的交集）。通过定义联合面性子空间T及其仿射平移T_a，将原始集合的交集问题转化为在T_a上的交集问题，使得相对内部总是相交，从而无需限定条件即可应用经典定理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统凸分析中的许多重要结果（如次微分可加性、法锥的交集等）需要满足相对内部相交等限定条件。本文旨在开发一个几何框架，绕过这些限定条件，使经典定理在更一般情况下适用。

Method: 定义联合面性子空间T（由C-D在0处生成的面张成的子空间）及其仿射平移T_a。将原始集合C和D限制到T_a上，得到C∩T_a和D∩T_a，它们是原始集合的面。通过这种双边面部约简，相对内部在T_a上总是相交。

Result: 在联合面性子空间T_a上，相对内部总是相交，使得经典凸分析定理无需限定条件即可应用。获得了次微分可加性、交集法锥、次微分链式法则、(f+g)*的达到下卷积、精确的Fenchel-Rockafellar对偶等重要推广结果。

Conclusion: 提出的几何框架成功扩展了凸分析结果，超越了标准限定条件。联合面性子空间T_a提供了双边面部约简，使得相对内部总是相交，从而能够无限定地应用经典定理。该框架还引入了面性子空间和嵌套法向量等新概念来描述凸边界和面的格结构。

Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric framework to extend convex analysis results
beyond standard qualification conditions such as intersecting relative
interiors of domains. We define the joint facial subspace $T$ as the span of
the face of $C - D$ generated by $0$, with its affine translation $T_a$
containing $C \cap D$. The intersections $C \cap T_a$ and $D \cap T_a$ are
faces of the original sets, establishing $T_a$ as a bilateral facial reduction
with parallels to Borwein-Wolkowicz facial reduction in conic programming. When
reducing the domains of two convex functions to their joint facial subspace
$T_a$, their relative interiors then always intersect, enabling unqualified
application of classical theorems via localization. Key generalizations include
subdifferential additivity, normal cones of intersections, a subdifferential
chain rule, attained infimal convolution for $(f+g)^*,$ and an exact
Fenchel-Rockafellar dual. We characterize $T$ via generated faces and
computationally through an iterative process converging in at most $n$ steps in
$\mathbb{R}^n$. Proofs are self-contained and introduce novel concepts like
facial subspaces and nested normals to describe convex boundaries and the
lattice of faces.

Abstract: N-glycosylation is a critical quality attribute of monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs), the dominant class of biopharmaceuticals. Controlling glycosylation
remains difficult due to intrinsic pathway complexity, limited online
measurements, and a lack of tailored control strategies. This work applies an
adaptive nonlinear model predictive control (ANMPC) framework to a fed-batch
mAb production process, using a multiscale model that links extracellular
conditions to intracellular Golgi reactions to predict glycan profiles. Model
parameters are updated online as new measurements arrive, after which a
shrinking-horizon optimization computes the control inputs; only the first
control move is implemented each cycle. Case studies show that, with a minimal
day-1 galactose excitation, ANMPC mitigates model-plant mismatch and achieves
up to 130% and 96% higher performance than open-loop optimization and state
NMPC, respectively. Under more realistic conditions (partial measurement
availability and longer preparation time), ANMPC maintains comparable
performance, indicating robustness to practical limitations. Overall, the
results demonstrate that ANMPC can actively shape glycan distributions in
silico and offers a viable path toward closed-loop control of mAb
glycosylation.

Abstract: We derive a new Carleman estimate for a general backward stochastic parabolic
equation with dynamic boundary conditions, incorporating weak divergence source
terms in both the bulk and surface equations. This estimate is obtained through
two main steps: first, by refining a known Carleman estimate for backward
stochastic parabolic equations to explicitly account for the dependence of the
parameters on the final control time \(T\); second, by applying a duality
technique to address weak divergence source terms. As an application, we prove
the null and approximate controllability of forward stochastic parabolic
equations with dynamic boundary conditions, which involve both reaction and
convection terms with bounded adapted coefficients, as well as general
second-order parabolic operators. Additionally, we provide an explicit estimate
for the null-controllability cost in terms of the final control time \(T\) and
the coefficients of the equation.

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a fundamental class of convex optimization
problems with diverse applications in mathematics, engineering, machine
learning, and related disciplines. This paper investigates the application of
the polyhedral bundle method to standard SDPs. The basic idea of this method is
to approximate semidefinite constraints using linear constraints, and thereby
transform the SDP problem into a series of quadratic programming subproblems.
However, the number of linear constraints often increases continuously during
the iteration process, leading to a significant reduction in the solution
efficiency. Therefore, based on the idea of limiting the upper bound on the
number of bundles, we heuristically select the upper bound through numerical
experiments according to the rank of the primal optimal solution and propose a
modified subproblem. In this way, under the premise of ensuring the
approximation ability of the lower approximation model, we minimize the number
of bundles as much as possible to improve the solution efficiency of the
subproblems. The algorithm performs well in both Max-Cut problems and random
SDP problems. In particular, for random sparse SDP problems with low condition
numbers, under the condition of a relative accuracy of \(10^{-4}\), it shows a
significant improvement compared with algorithms such as interior-point
methods.

Result: 大量实验表明，GTCTV-DPC在定量指标和视觉质量上始终优于现有方法，特别是在低采样率下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 提出的GTCTV-DPC框架为张量补全提供了理论严谨且性能优越的解决方案，特别适用于低采样率场景。

Abstract: Missing entries in multi dimensional data pose significant challenges for
downstream analysis across diverse real world applications. These data are
naturally modeled as tensors, and recent completion methods integrating global
low rank priors with plug and play denoisers have demonstrated strong empirical
performance. However, these approaches often rely on empirical convergence
alone or unrealistic assumptions, such as deep denoisers acting as proximal
operators of implicit regularizers, which generally does not hold. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel tensor completion framework grounded in
the monotone inclusion paradigm, which unifies generalized low rank priors with
deep pseudo contractive denoisers and extends beyond traditional convex
optimization. Building on the Davis Yin splitting scheme, we develop the GTCTV
DPC algorithm and rigorously establish its global convergence. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GTCTV DPC consistently outperforms existing
methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly at low
sampling rates.

Abstract: We introduce a control design and analysis framework for micro-macro,
boundary control of large-scale, $n+m$ hyperbolic PDE systems. Specifically, we
develop feedback laws for stabilization of hyperbolic systems at the micro
level (i.e., of the large-scale system) that employ a) measurements obtained
from the $n+m$ system (i.e., at micro level) and kernels constructed based on
an $\infty+\infty$ continuum system counterpart (i.e., at macro level), or b)
kernels and measurements both stemming from a continuum counterpart, or c)
averaged-continuum kernels/measurements. We also address (d)) stabilization of
the continuum (macro) system, employing continuum kernels and measurements.
Towards addressing d) we derive in a constructive manner an $\infty+\infty$
continuum approximation of $n+m$ hyperbolic systems and establish that its
solutions approximate, for large $n$ and $m$, the solutions of the $n+m$
system. We then construct a feedback law for stabilization of the
$\infty+\infty$ system via introduction of a continuum-PDE backstepping
transformation. We establish well-posedness of the resulting 4-D kernel
equations and prove closed-loop stability via construction of a novel Lyapunov
functional. Furthermore, under control configuration a) we establish that the
closed-loop system is exponentially stable provided that $n$ and $m$ are large,
by proving that the exact, stabilizing $n+m$ control kernels can be accurately
approximated by the continuum kernels. While under control configurations b)
and c), we establish closed-loop stability capitalizing on the established
solutions' and kernels' approximation properties via employment of
infinite-dimensional ISS arguments. We provide two numerical simulation
examples to illustrate the effectiveness and potential limitations of our
design approach.

Abstract: Periodic timetabling for public transportation networks is typically modelled
as a Periodic Event Scheduling Problem (PESP). Solving instances of the
benchmark library PESPlib to optimality continues to pose a challenge. As a
further approach towards this goal, we remodel the problem by a time
discretization of the underlying graph and consider arc-based as well as
path-based integer programming formulations. For the path-based case, we use
cycles on the graph expansion of the operational lines as variables and,
therefore, include more of the problem inherent structure into the model. A
consequence is the validity of several known inequalities and a lower bound on
the LP-relaxation, that is the best known to date. As an extension we integrate
passenger routing into the new model. The proposed models have an advantage in
the linear programming relaxation, on the one hand, but have an increased
problem size, on the other hand. We define the corresponding pricing problems
for the use of column generation to handle the size. Both models are
practically tested on different problem instances.

Conclusion: 时间变化性对梯度算法的收敛速率施加了内在限制，存在问题条件数、时间复杂度和收敛速率之间的基本权衡关系。

Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental performance limits of gradient-based
algorithms for time-varying optimization. Leveraging the internal model
principle and root locus techniques, we show that temporal variabilities impose
intrinsic limits on the achievable rate of convergence. For a problem with
condition ratio $\kappa$ and time variation whose model has degree $n$, we show
that the worst-case convergence rate of any minimal-order gradient-based
algorithm is $\rho_\text{TV} = (\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa+1})^{1/n}$. This bound
reveals a fundamental tradeoff between problem conditioning, temporal
complexity, and rate of convergence. We further construct explicit controllers
that attain the bound for low-degree models of time variation.
