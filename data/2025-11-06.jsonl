Our\nanalysis reveals how ambiguity aversion, risk aversion, and the elasticity of\nintertemporal substitution (EIS) influence the optimal policies.

As this\nproblem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,\nadvancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions\nthat reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic\nscenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to\nlearn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,\ndegrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment\nbetween the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for\neffective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and\nvision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.\nThis shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D\nscenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address\nthis, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse\ntools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate\nalignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed\ninstructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world\nenvironments.

The approach\nuses neighboring observations as repeated measurements, after suitably\ncontrolling for the random distance between the observations in a way that\nallows the use of operator diagonalization methods to establish identification.\nThe method is applicable to general nonlinear models with potentially\nnonclassical errors and does not rely on a priori distributional assumptions\nregarding any of the variables.

Although machine learning models\nhave advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks\nthat compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems.\nConventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require\nextensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits\nadaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework\nthat uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and\nsanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot\nlearning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \\textit{role play} prompting,\nwhereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor\nanomalies, and \\textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer\npoisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives.\nThese strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable\nrobust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time.

We address this gap through developing a dual-separation\nresult via two complementary perspectives: statistical estimation and network\napproximation.

This is a challenge of\nparticular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in\ndeveloping just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level\neffects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In\nthis paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored\nto the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.\nWe then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization\nand population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret\nand minimum exploration probability.

On a controlled synthetic biography\nbenchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion\nwhile still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean\ncorpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and\ncompetitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best\noverall stability-plasticity trade-off.

It\nis essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various\ninformation from multiple modalities. The main challenge is how to\nappropriately align and fuse the representations of different modalities into a\njoint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the\nKronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities\nand indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the\njoint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is\nunderexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the\ninteractions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution\nand marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel\ncopula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the\njoint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions\namong them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align\nthe marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a\nGaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint\ndistribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing\nmodalities.

The results revealed that, with\nrespect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable\ndecline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original\nunquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in\nsize, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the\npracticality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection."}

Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of\nmisinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a\ncritical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are\nincreasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known\nabout whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a\nconspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated\npsychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under\ndifferent prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs\nshow partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning\nwith socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent\ndemographic biases.

Unlike\ntraditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora\nand often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach\neliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of\nmulti-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named\nDMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different\ntransport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to\nobtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using\na novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and\nmaximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline\nis demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation\ncontext. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%\nand an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers\nand recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that\nSentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over\nalternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%\ngain compared to standard contrastive objectives.

Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation\nQ-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs\nexpert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence\nmechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.\nThis enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training\nwhile maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance.

Evaluating prompting and\nfinetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor with both human A/B\ntesting and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, we find that access to one future turn and\ninformation about utterance length improves reconstruction, placeholder\nprompting helps to mitigate hallucination, and while large models generate\npromising reconstructions with prompting, smaller models require finetuning.\nFurther, high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing\nturns. We present 1SC as a novel challenge and report promising results that\nmark a step toward privacy-aware conversational AI."}

A critical distinction in this\ncontext is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or\nfalse answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic\nknowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what\nis the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,\nclassical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight\nfundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,\nchallenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we\ndevelop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating\nwhether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world\npopulations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social\nbehavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not\nseem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the\ncontext of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that\nlanguage models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer\n1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional\n(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also\nlimited."}

We address this gap through developing a dual-separation\nresult via two complementary perspectives: statistical estimation and network\napproximation.
