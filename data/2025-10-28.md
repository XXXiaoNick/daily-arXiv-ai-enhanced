### [2] [Policy Optimization Prefers The Path of Least Resistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21853)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Aakash Sen Sharma,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 政策优化算法在开放式的思维链结构中会遵循最小阻力路径，倾向于丢弃显式推理而退化为仅输出答案的格式，即使复杂格式被赋予更高奖励权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政策优化在放松严格思维链约束后的行为，当前最先进的方法强制使用严格的"思考-回答"格式，但政策优化在开放式思维链结构中的行为仍未被充分研究。

Method: 通过一系列受控实验和奖励分解实验，分析政策优化在不同模型和算法中的行为模式，包括调整奖励权重和观察KL正则化政策的变化。

Result: 政策优化始终遵循最小阻力路径，学习丢弃显式推理，退化为仅输出答案的格式，即使复杂格式被赋予4倍奖励权重。优化过程会优先优化最简单的奖励组件。

Conclusion: 给予政策偏离自由是一把双刃剑：虽然有助于发现高奖励捷径，但也创造了博弈奖励函数最简单方面的强大激励，这对对齐中的奖励黑客构成了关键挑战。

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) algorithms are used to refine Large Language Models
for complex, multi-step reasoning. Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a
strict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the
behavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT
structure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an
extensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:
\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.
When afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy
optimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the
policy to degenerate to a direct \texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome
holds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in
format is persistent even when the complex \texttt{<think><answer>} format is
assigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a
series of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear
hierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,
a preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or
strong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful
convergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven
by the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have
sufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior. Our
findings reveal that granting policies the freedom to diverge is a double-edged
sword: while necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts, it also creates a
powerful incentive to game the simplest aspects of the reward function, posing
a critical challenge for reward hacking under alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Language Ranker框架，将LLM解码过程类比推荐系统排序阶段，通过轻量级模块重排候选响应，在性能媲美大型奖励模型的同时显著降低计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM研究主要关注输出分布优化，忽视解码过程。现有奖励模型方法计算成本高且适用性有限，传统解码方法存在冗余等问题

Method: 引入轻量级重排模块，利用基础模型提取的特征对候选响应进行重排，仅需<0.5M额外参数

Result: 在多种任务上实现与大型奖励模型相当的性能，同时显著降低训练和推理阶段的计算开销

Conclusion: 该方法高效且有效，展示了充分释放LLM潜力的潜力

Abstract: Conventional research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused
on refining output distributions, while paying less attention to the decoding
process that transforms these distributions into final responses. Recent
advances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models,
have underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer
from high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we
revisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing
the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation
pipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding
methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy.
Motivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that
introduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features
extracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that
Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models,
while requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the
computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This
highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, showcasing its
potential to fully unlock the capabilities of LLMs.

### [4] [Framework for Machine Evaluation of Reasoning Completeness in Large Language Models For Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21884)
*Avinash Patil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE框架评估LLM生成解释与逻辑回归特征重要性之间的对齐度，发现正确预测更覆盖支持特征，错误预测更覆盖矛盾特征，揭示LLM解释既重用表面证据又可能放大误导信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感领域的应用增加，对可解释AI的需求日益增长。LLM能生成自然语言解释，但这些解释是否真实反映决策的预测信号尚不明确。

Method: RACE框架通过token感知、精确字符串匹配和编辑距离匹配技术，在四个文本分类数据集上比较LLM解释与逻辑回归基准的特征重要性得分。

Result: 实证结果显示一致的不对称性：正确预测更覆盖支持特征，错误预测更关联矛盾特征。编辑距离匹配发现释义重叠，提高覆盖率但保持不对称性。

Conclusion: LLM解释结合了表面级和灵活的证据重用，但在错误情况下也可能放大误导线索。RACE为评估LLM解释的忠实性和推理完整性提供了量化基础。

Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning (ML) in sensitive domains has
heightened the demand for transparent and interpretable artificial
intelligence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of
producing natural language explanations, yet it remains unclear whether these
rationales faithfully capture the predictive signals that underlie decisions.
This paper introduces RACE-Reasoning Alignment for Completeness of
Explanations, a systematic framework to evaluate the alignment between
LLM-generated explanations and interpretable feature importance scores derived
from a logistic regression baseline. We analyze four widely used text
classification datasets-WIKI ONTOLOGY, AG NEWS, IMDB, and GOEMOTIONS-and
compare LLM rationales against top-ranked supporting and contradicting lexical
features. To capture alignment at multiple levels of granularity, RACE
implements token-aware, exact string, and edit-distance matching techniques.
Empirical results reveal a consistent asymmetry: correct predictions exhibit
higher coverage of supporting features, while incorrect predictions are
associated with elevated coverage of contradicting features. Edit-distance
matching further uncovers paraphrastic overlaps, boosting coverage while
preserving this asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that LLM rationales
combine both surface-level and flexible evidence reuse, yet can also amplify
misleading cues in error cases. RACE provides new insights into the
faithfulness of LLM explanations and establishes a quantitative basis for
evaluating reasoning completeness in neural language models.

### [5] [Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting: Behavior-Aware Sampling for Safer Language Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21885)
*Anh Pham,Mihir Thalanki,Michael Sun,Aditya Chaloo,Ankita Gupta,Tian Xia,Aditya Mate,Ehimwenma Nosakhare,Soundararajan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出行为感知采样框架，通过基于指令-响应行为和语义多样性的安全示例选择，有效缓解大语言模型微调时的灾难性遗忘问题，仅需0.5%额外训练数据即可减少41%有害输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在良性数据上微调时经常失去之前对齐的安全行为（灾难性遗忘），现有方法添加随机安全示例效果有限，需要确定哪些示例最有效。

Method: 提出行为感知采样框架，基于两个互补因素选择安全示例：指令-响应行为（如拒绝vs遵从）和跨伤害类别的语义多样性。

Result: 系统评估显示该方法显著减少有害输出同时保持帮助性，仅用0.5%额外训练数据即可实现高达41%的危害性降低。

Conclusion: 定向数据选择可以显著提高大规模微调的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when
fine-tuned on benign data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Prior
work shows that adding random safety examples can mitigate this effect, but it
remains unclear which examples are most effective. We propose a behavior-aware
sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two complementary
factors: instruction-response behavior (e.g., refusal versus compliance) and
semantic diversity across harm categories. Systematic evaluation shows that
this approach substantially reduces harmful outputs while maintaining
helpfulness, achieving up to a 41% reduction in harmfulness with only 0.5%
additional training data. These results highlight how targeted data selection
can improve the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning at scale.

### [6] [Embedding Trust: Semantic Isotropy Predicts Nonfactuality in Long-Form Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21891)
*Dhrupad Bhardwaj,Julia Kempe,Tim G. J. Rudner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出语义各向同性概念，通过分析文本嵌入在单位球面上的分布均匀性来评估LLM长文本响应的可信度，无需标注数据、微调或超参数选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要准确回答开放式问题的高风险应用领域部署LLM时，需要可靠且计算成本低的方法来评估长文本响应的可信度。现有基于逐项事实核查的方法计算成本高且对长文本响应效果不佳。

Method: 生成多个长文本响应，将其嵌入到向量空间，通过计算嵌入向量在单位球面上的角分散度来估计语义各向同性水平。

Result: 研究发现更高的语义各向同性（即更大的嵌入分散度）可靠地表明样本间的事实一致性较低。该方法在多个领域都优于现有方法，仅需少量样本即可预测长文本响应的非事实性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、低成本的信任评估方法，可集成到实际LLM工作流程中，适用于开放或封闭权重的嵌入模型。

Abstract: To deploy large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes application domains
that require substantively accurate responses to open-ended prompts, we need
reliable, computationally inexpensive methods that assess the trustworthiness
of long-form responses generated by LLMs. However, existing approaches often
rely on claim-by-claim fact-checking, which is computationally expensive and
brittle in long-form responses to open-ended prompts. In this work, we
introduce semantic isotropy -- the degree of uniformity across normalized text
embeddings on the unit sphere -- and use it to assess the trustworthiness of
long-form responses generated by LLMs. To do so, we generate several long-form
responses, embed them, and estimate the level of semantic isotropy of these
responses as the angular dispersion of the embeddings on the unit sphere. We
find that higher semantic isotropy -- that is, greater embedding dispersion --
reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples. Our approach
requires no labeled data, no fine-tuning, and no hyperparameter selection, and
can be used with open- or closed-weight embedding models. Across multiple
domains, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting
nonfactuality in long-form responses using only a handful of samples --
offering a practical, low-cost approach for integrating trust assessment into
real-world LLM workflows.

### [7] [Understanding Network Behaviors through Natural Language Question-Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21894)
*Mingzhe Xing,Chang Tian,Jianan Zhang,Lichen Pan,Peipei Liu,Zhaoteng Yan,Yinliang Yue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NetMind是一个使用自然语言查询网络的框架，通过树状配置分块、统一事实图和混合命令式-声明式语言来解决LLM在网络配置理解中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大规模网络配置复杂，传统基于领域特定语言的方法学习曲线陡峭且灵活性有限，而自然语言提供了更易访问和可解释的接口。

Method: 采用树状配置分块策略保持语义连贯性，构建统一事实图作为中间表示来规范化供应商特定配置，设计混合命令式-声明式语言减轻LLM推理负担。

Result: 实验表明NetMind实现了准确且可扩展的网络行为理解，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NetMind通过创新的配置处理和推理方法，有效解决了LLM在网络配置理解中的挑战，为自然语言驱动的网络行为理解提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modern large-scale networks introduce significant complexity in understanding
network behaviors, increasing the risk of misconfiguration. Prior work proposed
to understand network behaviors by mining network configurations, typically
relying on domain-specific languages interfaced with formal models. While
effective, they suffer from a steep learning curve and limited flexibility. In
contrast, natural language (NL) offers a more accessible and interpretable
interface, motivating recent research on NL-guided network behavior
understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) further enhance
this direction, leveraging their extensive prior knowledge of network concepts
and strong reasoning capabilities. However, three key challenges remain: 1)
numerous router devices with lengthy configuration files challenge LLM's
long-context understanding ability; 2) heterogeneity across devices and
protocols impedes scalability; and 3) complex network topologies and protocols
demand advanced reasoning abilities beyond the current capabilities of LLMs. To
tackle the above challenges, we propose NetMind, a novel framework for querying
networks using NL. Our approach introduces a tree-based configuration chunking
strategy to preserve semantic coherence while enabling efficient partitioning.
We then construct a unified fact graph as an intermediate representation to
normalize vendor-specific configurations. Finally, we design a hybrid
imperative-declarative language to reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and
enhance precision. We contribute a benchmark consisting of NL question-answer
pairs paired with network configurations. Experiments demonstrate that NetMind
achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding, outperforming
existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出IterSurvey框架，通过递归大纲生成和迭代检索阅读，解决传统文献综述生成中的噪声检索、碎片化结构和上下文过载问题，显著提升综述质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献综述生成系统采用一次性检索和静态大纲生成，导致检索噪声大、结构碎片化、上下文过载，限制了综述质量。受人类研究者迭代阅读过程启发，需要更智能的生成方法。

Method: 基于递归大纲生成框架，规划代理增量检索、阅读和更新大纲；设计论文卡片提取每篇论文的贡献、方法和发现；引入审阅-精炼循环和可视化增强来改善文本流并整合多模态元素。

Result: 在已建立和新兴主题上的实验表明，IterSurvey在内容覆盖、结构连贯性和引用质量方面显著优于最先进基线，生成更易访问和组织更好的综述。

Conclusion: IterSurvey通过迭代方法有效提升了自动文献综述的质量，同时引入Survey-Arena基准提供了更可靠的评估方法，为自动文献综述生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention,
yet most existing systems follow a one-shot paradigm, where a large set of
papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting.
This design often leads to noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context
overload, ultimately limiting survey quality. Inspired by the iterative reading
process of human researchers, we propose \ours, a framework based on recurrent
outline generation, in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves, reads,
and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence. To provide
faithful paper-level grounding, we design paper cards that distill each paper
into its contributions, methods, and findings, and introduce a
review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow
and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables. Experiments on
both established and emerging topics show that \ours\ substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and
citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys.
To provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements, we further
introduce Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring
and more clearly positions machine-generated surveys relative to human-written
ones. The code is available at
https://github.com/HancCui/IterSurvey\_Autosurveyv2.

### [9] [Explaining and Mitigating Crosslingual Tokenizer Inequities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21909)
*Catherine Arnett,Tyler A. Chang,Stella Biderman,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The number of tokens it takes to encode parallel text in different languages
is known to vary. These disparities are called token premiums. Having high
token premiums leads to less throughput during training and increases costs at
inference. In this paper, we show that even after controlling for dataset size,
vocabulary size, and data content, monolingual tokenizers exhibit a wide range
of token premiums across languages. To understand the cross-linguistic
differences that cause these token premiums, we train a suite of approximately
7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating
tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. We measure token
premiums and test for a relationship between factors such as data similarity
(between tokenizer training and evaluation), vocabulary size, and
pre-tokenization. We also investigate the role of language-specific features
such as writing system and word length. We find that similarity between
training and test data does not impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and
pre-tokenization do. While simply increasing vocabulary size does not lead to
reduced token premium effects, we can determine an ``optimal'' vocabulary size
for each language to achieve significantly reduced token premium effects. We
also train superword tokenizers which allow merges over whitespaces, and we
find that they both reduce token premium effects and improve compression
overall. Thus, intervening on the vocabulary size or the pre-tokenizer
significantly reduces crosslingual token premium effects.

### [10] [Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21954)
*Mykola Haltiuk,Aleksander Smywiński-Pohl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATT是一种模型感知的分词器迁移方法，通过注意力影响建模将源模型的token间通信模式蒸馏到使用新分词器的目标模型中，相比仅关注嵌入相似性的启发式方法，能更有效地实现多语言LLM的分词器迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词器迁移方法通常依赖语义启发式来初始化新嵌入，忽略了更高层的模型动态，限制了迁移质量。需要一种能结合模型内部动态的分词器迁移方法。

Method: 提出MATT方法，引入注意力影响建模(AIM)目标，将源模型的token间通信模式蒸馏到使用新分词器的目标模型中，为标准语言建模提供高效预热。

Result: 在多样化语言设置下的实验表明，MATT在几个GPU小时内就能恢复原始模型的大部分性能，优于启发式基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合模型级信号为多语言LLM中的鲁棒分词器迁移提供了实用有效的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to support an increasing number of
languages, yet their predefined tokenizers remain a bottleneck for adapting
models to lower-resource or distinct-script languages. Existing tokenizer
transfer methods typically rely on semantic heuristics to initialize new
embeddings, ignoring higher-layer model dynamics and limiting transfer quality.
We propose Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method that incorporates
model internals into the tokenizer transfer process. MATT introduces an
Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective that distills inter-token
communication patterns from a source model into a target model with a new
tokenizer, providing an efficient warm-up before standard language modeling.
Unlike approaches that focus solely on embedding similarity, MATT leverages
attention behavior to guide embedding initialization and adaptation.
Experiments across diverse linguistic settings show that MATT recovers a large
fraction of the original model's performance within a few GPU hours,
outperforming heuristic baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating
model-level signals offers a practical and effective path toward robust
tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型可以通过训练特定作者的作品来识别该作者的写作风格，并能准确区分不同作者的作品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在作者身份识别方面的能力，验证模型是否能捕捉和体现特定作者的独特写作风格。

Method: 为每位作者从头训练一个GPT-2模型，然后比较模型对该作者作品与其他作者作品的预测准确性。

Result: 模型能够更准确地预测训练作者的作品，成功识别了八位不同作者的写作风格，并确认了R. P. Thompson是Oz系列第15本书的真实作者。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能够有效捕捉和体现特定作者的独特写作风格，可用于作者身份识别和归属确认。

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used to distinguish the
writings of different authors. Specifically, an individual GPT-2 model, trained
from scratch on the works of one author, will predict held-out text from that
author more accurately than held-out text from other authors. We suggest that,
in this way, a model trained on one author's works embodies the unique writing
style of that author. We first demonstrate our approach on books written by
eight different (known) authors. We also use this approach to confirm R. P.
Thompson's authorship of the well-studied 15th book of the Oz series,
originally attributed to F. L. Baum.

TL;DR: 该论文研究如何利用社会科学的说服理论来构建对抗性提示，以绕过LLM的对齐约束，发现具有说服结构的提示能显著提高越狱成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有多种越狱攻击策略，但很少关注语言和心理机制对模型易受攻击性的影响。作者认为LLM在大量人类生成文本上训练，可能对具有说服结构的提示更顺从。

Method: 借鉴社会科学的经典说服理论，构建具有说服力的对抗性提示，并在多个对齐LLM上进行实证评估。

Result: 实验表明，基于说服理论的提示能显著绕过LLM的安全防护，诱导越狱行为。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了跨学科洞察在应对LLM安全挑战中的重要性，说服策略是有效的越狱攻击手段。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While
prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human
readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the
linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's
susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary
line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the
social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment
constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we
hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text,
may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures.
Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive
fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations
across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly
bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors.
This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in
addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are
available.

Motivation: 尽管基于离散优化的越狱攻击中短后缀的迁移性已被经验证实，但缺乏对其何时及为何发生的严格分析。

Method: 通过大量实验设置，识别与迁移成功强相关的三个统计特性：无后缀提示激活拒绝方向的程度、后缀诱导远离拒绝方向的强度、以及正交于拒绝方向上的偏移大小。

Result: 发现三个统计特性与迁移成功强相关，而提示语义相似性仅弱相关。通过干预实验展示了统计分析如何转化为攻击成功的实际改进。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对越狱攻击迁移性更细粒度的理解，并展示了如何将统计分析转化为实际攻击效果的提升。

Abstract: Discrete optimization-based jailbreaking attacks on large language models aim
to generate short, nonsensical suffixes that, when appended onto input prompts,
elicit disallowed content. Notably, these suffixes are often transferable --
succeeding on prompts and models for which they were never optimized. And yet,
despite the fact that transferability is surprising and empirically
well-established, the field lacks a rigorous analysis of when and why transfer
occurs. To fill this gap, we identify three statistical properties that
strongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings:
(1) how much a prompt without a suffix activates a model's internal refusal
direction, (2) how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction,
and (3) how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal. On the
other hand, we find that prompt semantic similarity only weakly correlates with
transfer success. These findings lead to a more fine-grained understanding of
transferability, which we use in interventional experiments to showcase how our
statistical analysis can translate into practical improvements in attack
success.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了机器翻译质量评估(QE)指标中的长度偏差问题，发现QE指标会过度预测长翻译的错误，并偏好短翻译，提出了长度归一化和引入参考文本两种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量评估指标在机器翻译中至关重要，但长度偏差的普遍性和影响尚未得到充分探索，这可能导致对长翻译的不公平惩罚和次优决策。

Method: 对10种不同语言对的顶级回归基和LLM-as-a-Judge QE指标进行系统研究，识别两种关键长度偏差，并提出长度归一化和引入参考文本两种缓解策略。

Result: 发现QE指标确实存在两种长度偏差：随着翻译长度增加而过度预测错误，以及对同一源文本的多个候选翻译偏好短翻译。提出的两种策略都能有效减少长度偏差。

Conclusion: QE指标存在显著的长度偏差问题，需要通过长度归一化和引入参考文本来缓解，以确保公平评估和优化应用决策。

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) metrics are vital in machine translation for
reference-free evaluation and as a reward signal in tasks like reinforcement
learning. However, the prevalence and impact of length bias in QE have been
underexplored. Through a systematic study of top-performing regression-based
and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across 10 diverse language pairs, we reveal two
critical length biases: First, QE metrics consistently over-predict errors with
increasing translation length, even for high-quality, error-free texts. Second,
they exhibit a preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are
available for the same source text. These inherent length biases risk unfairly
penalizing longer, correct translations and can lead to sub-optimal
decision-making in applications such as QE reranking and QE guided
reinforcement learning. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: (a)
applying length normalization during model training, and (b) incorporating
reference texts during evaluation. Both approaches were found to effectively
reduce the identified length bias.

TL;DR: 本文进行了迄今为止最大的多语言缩放定律研究，通过774个多语言训练实验，提出了自适应迁移缩放定律(ATLAS)，在单语和多语言预训练中都优于现有缩放定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的缩放定律研究主要集中在英语上，而最先进的AI模型需要服务数十亿国际用户，因此需要研究多语言环境下的缩放定律。

Method: 进行了774个多语言训练实验，涵盖10M-8B模型参数、400+训练语言和48个评估语言，提出了ATLAS缩放定律，并分析了跨语言迁移矩阵、语言无关缩放定律等。

Result: ATLAS在样本外泛化方面比现有缩放定律平均提高超过0.3 R²，推导出了38×38=1444个语言对的跨语言迁移矩阵，识别了从头预训练与微调的计算交叉点。

Conclusion: 这些发现为跨语言民主化缩放定律提供了科学基础，使从业者能够高效扩展模型，超越英语优先的AI范式。

Abstract: Scaling laws research has focused overwhelmingly on English -- yet the most
prominent AI models explicitly serve billions of international users. In this
work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date,
totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model
parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce
the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual
pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample
generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed
light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages,
and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer
matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444
language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals
how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without
sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points
for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual
checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for
democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to
efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.

### [16] [Emotions Where Art Thou: Understanding and Characterizing the Emotional Latent Space of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22042)
*Benjamin Reichman,Adar Avsian,Larry Heck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析LLM隐藏状态空间的几何结构，揭示了其内部情感表示的低维流形结构，发现情感表征具有方向性编码、跨层分布的特点，并在多语言数据集上表现出通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何内部表示和处理情感，理解其情感表征的几何结构和可操纵性。

Method: 分析LLM隐藏状态空间的几何结构，识别低维情感流形，研究情感表征的方向性编码和跨层分布特性，并在8个真实世界情感数据集上进行验证。

Result: 发现LLM中存在稳定的低维情感子空间，情感表征具有方向性编码特性，跨域对齐误差低且线性探针性能强，情感感知可通过学习干预模块进行操控。

Conclusion: LLM中存在一致且可操纵的情感几何结构，这为理解模型如何内化和处理情感提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent
emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper
identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional
representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and
aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth
and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages.
Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance,
indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion
perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned
intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across
languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective
geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process
emotion.

*Atij Mahesh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文比较了六种减少LLM性别偏见的技术，发现监督微调(SFT)在约束合规性和词汇多样性方面表现最佳，而基于偏好的方法(如DPO)无法满足组合约束要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有多种方法试图减少LLM中的性别偏见，但不同方法的比较效果和学习动态仍不清楚，需要系统分析各种控制技术的优劣。

Method: 比较分析了六种偏见缓解控制技术：仅提示、生成后过滤、DFA-based Ctrl-G解码、监督微调(SFT)、直接偏好优化(DPO)和迭代零空间投影(INLP)，在组合约束任务上进行评估。

Result: SFT达到99.87%的合规率和高的词汇多样性，DPO仅4.53%合规率，Ctrl-G保证完美合规但牺牲流畅性和多样性。基于偏好的方法无法满足组合约束。

Conclusion: 只有明确的正面监督才能有效缓解组合偏见，基于偏好的对齐方法无法泛化逻辑结构，突显了偏好学习的局限性和明确监督对于公平流畅控制生成的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still produce gender-stereotyped language even
in occupation-neutral contexts that reflect deep societal biases (Rudinger et
al., 2018). To address this, prior work has proposed prompting, constrained
decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024), post-processing, and
fine-tuning-based alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ravfogel et al., 2022).
However, the comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain little
understood. We report a comparative analysis of six control techniques for bias
mitigation: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and
Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). We evaluate each method on a
compositional constraint task. This task requires generating sentences that
contain at least one agentic and one communal descriptor for each of the twenty
Winogender-derived occupations. We quantify trade-offs between control strength
and naturalness with evaluations of constraint compliance, lexical diversity,
and fluency. Our results reveal key contrasts among the methods: SFT achieves
99.87 +- 0.15% compliance and high lexical diversity, while DPO, despite
similar training stability, fails at 4.53 +- 0.82%. Ctrl-G guarantees perfect
compliance, but at the cost of severely reduced fluency and diversity.
Preference-based learning fundamentally differs: it cannot satisfy
compositional constraints, as binary preference signals encode ranking, not
logical conjunctions. Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of
compositional biases; preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical
structures, underscoring the limitations of preference learning and the
necessity of explicit supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架来理解和控制LLM的泛化与记忆模式，基于信息瓶颈理论开发了动态模式引导算法，通过线性探测和激活引导来提升模型可靠性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM存在泛化能力和死记硬背记忆的双重特性，这种不可预测性影响了在高风险应用中的可靠性。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈理论建立理论模型，开发动态模式引导算法，包括轻量级因果线性探测和动态激活引导机制，采用自适应自对比解码框架。

Result: 在推理和忠实性任务上的实验表明，DMS显著提高了逻辑一致性和事实准确性。

Conclusion: DMS为增强LLM可靠性提供了一种原则性方法，能够有效引导模型从记忆模式转向泛化模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a troubling duality, capable of both
remarkable generalization and brittle, verbatim memorization of their training
data. This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes
applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand,
identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a
theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle,
formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant
representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this
theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time
algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded
linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on
memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the
model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame
DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning
and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical
consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to
enhancing LLM reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过对输入token进行对数压缩来扩展transformer长程记忆能力的方法，而不是修改transformer架构本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过集成递归或辅助记忆模块来增加transformer架构的复杂性，作者希望找到一种更简单的替代方案。

Method: 受人类记忆认知模型启发，对输入token应用尺度不变的对数压缩，生成压缩表示后由标准transformer处理。

Result: 在WikiText-103和PG-19语言建模基准测试中，相比未压缩基线降低了困惑度，且随着压缩时间上下文变长，性能持续提升。

Conclusion: 输入级对数压缩是扩展transformer长程记忆的一种简单有效方法，保持了架构的简洁性。

Abstract: Most approaches to long-context processing increase the complexity of the
transformer's internal architecture by integrating mechanisms such as
recurrence or auxiliary memory modules. In this work, we introduce an
alternative approach that modifies the input representation itself, rather than
the transformer architecture. Inspired by cognitive models of human memory, our
method applies a scale-invariant logarithmic compression to the input tokens.
The resulting compressed representation is processed by a standard, unmodified
transformer, preserving architectural simplicity. We evaluate this approach on
the WikiText-103 and PG-19 language modeling benchmarks, showing a reduction in
perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines. Moreover, performance improves
consistently with longer compressed temporal contexts, showing that input-level
logarithmic compression is a simple and effective way to extend a transformer's
long-range memory.

Motivation: 构建一个能够从数百亿参数扩展到万亿参数的统一推理导向语言基础模型，通过稀疏激活和专门优化来提升推理能力，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 采用高稀疏度的MoE架构，结合推理导向数据、思维链激活训练、强化学习微调(DFT、Evo-CoT)，以及全规模FP8训练和细粒度异构流水线。

Result: Ling 2.0系列模型在推理准确性与计算效率之间建立了新的帕累托前沿，其中1万亿参数的Ling-1T相比密集模型实现了最高7倍的主动计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 当稀疏激活与推理目标正确对齐时，能够实现可扩展且高效的人工智能，Ling 2.0为未来推理和思维模型提供了连贯、开放和高效的基础。

Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built
upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed
to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity,
cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The
series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0,
Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and
achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense
counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model
architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity
MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training
CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale
FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale,
Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus
computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly
aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence.
Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for
advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built
upon the same base.

TL;DR: OlaMind是一个基于检索增强生成的人类化、防幻觉客户服务框架，通过两阶段学习（学习思考和学习响应）显著提升响应自然度并减少幻觉，在工业级社交客服场景中取得显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RAG的智能客服系统存在幻觉问题和机械式响应，这会带来商业风险并损害用户体验，特别是在Web客户服务场景中。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）Learn-to-Think阶段学习人类专家的推理过程和响应策略；2）Learn-to-Respond阶段结合冷启动监督微调和强化学习进行基础到困难的自我精炼。

Result: 在工业级社交客服环境中进行大规模在线A/B测试，在社区支持/直播互动场景中分别实现智能解决率+28.92%/+18.42%的提升，人工接管率-6.08%/-7.12%的降低。

Conclusion: OlaMind框架在多样化实际应用中表现出一致的有效性，显著增强了人类化程度和自然度，同时有效缓解了幻觉和关键商业风险。

Abstract: Intelligent customer service (ICS) systems via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have been widely adopted in Web-based domains such as social platforms
and e-commerce, achieving remarkable improvements in automation and efficiency.
However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to
hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can
introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based
customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service
framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a
Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies
from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform
cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning
(RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances
human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and
critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments
in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive
experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative
improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human
takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction
scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across
diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.

Motivation: 基于数字基础设施和生物医学创新的成功，旨在创建一个能够持续协调多模态数据、知识和服务的全球性AI系统，为个人和群体提供健康指导。

Method: 利用多模态代理、事件中心建模和上下文推理技术，整合个人感知、体验计算和群体分析，构建一个环境化、自适应的健康伴侣系统。

Result: PCU能够实时观察、解读和指导日常生活中的健康，提供个性化健康信息、主动行为指导和持续治疗响应监测。

Conclusion: PCU不仅能够改善个人健康结果，还为公共卫生和科学发现提供了新的基础，但实施仍面临架构设计和实现挑战。

Abstract: Building on decades of success in digital infrastructure and biomedical
innovation, we propose the Personal Care Utility (PCU) - a cybernetic system
for lifelong health guidance. PCU is conceived as a global, AI-powered utility
that continuously orchestrates multimodal data, knowledge, and services to
assist individuals and populations alike. Drawing on multimodal agents,
event-centric modeling, and contextual inference, it offers three essential
capabilities: (1) trusted health information tailored to the individual, (2)
proactive health navigation and behavior guidance, and (3) ongoing
interpretation of recovery and treatment response after medical events. Unlike
conventional episodic care, PCU functions as an ambient, adaptive companion -
observing, interpreting, and guiding health in real time across daily life. By
integrating personal sensing, experiential computing, and population-level
analytics, PCU promises not only improved outcomes for individuals but also a
new substrate for public health and scientific discovery. We describe the
architecture, design principles, and implementation challenges of this emerging
paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言如迈蒂利语在NLP研究中代表性不足，缺乏细粒度标注和可解释性机制，现有情感分析资源稀缺且标注粗糙。

Method: 构建包含3,221个迈蒂利语句子的数据集，由语言专家进行情感极性和自然语言解释的双重标注，确保标签可靠性和上下文保真度。

Result: 使用经典机器学习和先进Transformer架构进行广泛实验，验证了数据集在可解释情感分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为迈蒂利语建立了首个可解释情感计算基准，为多语言NLP和可解释AI的发展贡献了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages poses significant
challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of native linguistic
experts and the substantial time and cost involved in annotation. Given these
challenges, Maithili is still underrepresented in natural language processing
research. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 13 million people in
the Purvanchal region of India, valued for its rich linguistic structure and
cultural significance. While sentiment analysis has achieved remarkable
progress in high-resource languages, resources for low-resource languages, such
as Maithili, remain scarce, often restricted to coarse-grained annotations and
lacking interpretability mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel dataset comprising 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment
polarity and accompanied by natural language justifications. Moreover, the
dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure both
label reliability and contextual fidelity. Notably, the justifications are
written in Maithili, thereby promoting culturally grounded interpretation and
enhancing the explainability of sentiment models. Furthermore, extensive
experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art
transformer architectures demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for
interpretable sentiment analysis. Ultimately, this work establishes the first
benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili, thus contributing a
valuable resource to the broader advancement of multilingual NLP and
explainable AI.

TL;DR: 提出了DETECT，这是首个专门针对德语自动文本简化(ATS)的评估指标，能够全面评估简化质量、意义保留和流畅性三个维度，完全基于合成的大语言模型响应训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前德语ATS评估依赖于SARI、BLEU和BERTScore等通用指标，这些指标在捕捉简化质量方面不足。虽然英语已有LENS等专门指标，但德语因缺乏人工标注语料库而落后。

Method: 将LENS框架适配到德语，并扩展了：(i)通过LLM生成合成质量分数的流程，无需人工标注即可创建数据集；(ii)基于LLM的细化步骤，使评分标准与简化要求对齐。还构建了最大的德语人工评估数据集进行验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，DETECT与人类判断的相关性显著高于广泛使用的ATS指标，在意义保留和流畅性方面提升尤为明显。

Conclusion: DETECT填补了德语ATS评估的空白，证明了LLM在自动评估中的潜力和局限性，为通用语言可访问性任务提供了可转移的指导方针。

Abstract: Current evaluation of German automatic text simplification (ATS) relies on
general-purpose metrics such as SARI, BLEU, and BERTScore, which insufficiently
capture simplification quality in terms of simplicity, meaning preservation,
and fluency. While specialized metrics like LENS have been developed for
English, corresponding efforts for German have lagged behind due to the absence
of human-annotated corpora. To close this gap, we introduce DETECT, the first
German-specific metric that holistically evaluates ATS quality across all three
dimensions of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency, and is trained
entirely on synthetic large language model (LLM) responses. Our approach adapts
the LENS framework to German and extends it with (i) a pipeline for generating
synthetic quality scores via LLMs, enabling dataset creation without human
annotation, and (ii) an LLM-based refinement step for aligning grading criteria
with simplification requirements. To the best of our knowledge, we also
construct the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification
to validate our metric directly. Experimental results show that DETECT achieves
substantially higher correlations with human judgments than widely used ATS
metrics, with particularly strong gains in meaning preservation and fluency.
Beyond ATS, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of
LLMs for automatic evaluation and provide transferable guidelines for general
language accessibility tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究测量了LLM在成对文本比较中的输出错误概率，开发了一种不依赖真实标签的方法来估计错误率，包括均匀错误率和二元位置偏差两种情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在成对文本比较任务中的可靠性，特别是测量其输出错误的概率，而不需要依赖真实标签。

Method: 使用Copeland计数法从成对偏好构建文本排名，通过重复比较估计两种错误率：均匀错误率（不考虑比较顺序）和二元位置偏差（考虑不同比较顺序的错误率差异）。

Result: 在六个LLM（ChatGPT、Claude、DeepSeek、Gemini、Grok、Qwen）和五种文本输入类型上获得了一致的错误率估计。Claude在错误率和提示变化鲁棒性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在指示LLM成对比较任务错误方面优于有偏Bradley-Terry模型和交换性评分，位置偏差项与均匀错误接近，Claude表现最理想。

Abstract: We measure LLMs' output error at pairwise text comparison, noting the
probability of error in their preferences. Our method does not rely on the
ground truth and supports two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate regardless of
the order of comparison, estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with
either text placed first; (ii) binary positional bias assuming distinct error
rates for the two orders of comparison, estimated with repeated comparisons
between the texts. The Copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared
texts from pairwise preferences; the ranking reveals the poor scalability of
LLM-based pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for LLMs' error
rates. We apply the method to six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini,
Grok, Qwen) with five types of text input and obtain consistent estimates of
LLMs' error. In general, the measured two positional bias terms are similar,
close to the uniform error. Considering both the error rates and the robustness
to the variation of prompts, Claude obtained the most desirable performance in
this experiment. Our model outperforms the biased Bradley-Terry model and the
commutativity score in indicating LLMs' error at this task.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Swadesh方法在语言年代学中的局限性，指出即使满足所有假设条件，也存在固有的概率性精度限制，并提出了考虑词汇渐进修改过程可以提高时间分离估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swadesh方法的假设往往不现实，且即使假设完全满足，也存在数学上的精度限制。此外，语言词汇演化还受到词汇渐进修改过程的影响，这些因素在现有研究中常被忽视。

Method: 从概率论角度详细分析Swadesh方法的时间分离估计精度限制，并引入词汇渐进修改这一随机过程来改进模型。

Result: 研究发现Swadesh方法存在固有的概率性精度限制，而考虑词汇渐进修改过程可以显著提高时间分离估计的精度。

Conclusion: 语言年代学研究需要考虑词汇替换和词汇渐进修改两个随机过程，单纯依赖Swadesh方法存在根本性的精度限制，改进模型可以提高时间分离估计的准确性。

Abstract: The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two
languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a
complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that
the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to
various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers,
variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments
of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means
that the results cannot be completely correct.
  More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are
satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the
temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely
probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical
studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.
  Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's
lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical
modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a
major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the
centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that
taking into account this second random process significantly increases the
precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出了"Sculpting"约束式提示方法，相比标准CoT能减少语义模糊和常识错误。研究发现存在"提示反转"现象：Sculpting在gpt-4o上表现更好，但在更先进的gpt-5上反而有害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CoT提示存在语义模糊和常识错误的问题，需要开发更精确的提示方法来提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 提出基于规则的"Sculpting"约束提示方法，在GSM8K数学推理基准上评估三种提示策略（零样本、标准CoT、Sculpting）在三个OpenAI模型上的表现。

Result: Sculpting在gpt-4o上表现最佳（97% vs 93%），但在gpt-5上反而有害（94.00% vs 96.36%），存在"护栏到手铐"的转变现象。

Conclusion: 最优提示策略需要与模型能力共同进化，更强大的模型可能需要更简单的提示方法。

Abstract: Prompt engineering, particularly Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
significantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities. We introduce "Sculpting," a
constrained, rule-based prompting method designed to improve upon standard CoT
by reducing errors from semantic ambiguity and flawed common sense.
  We evaluate three prompting strategies (Zero Shot, standard CoT, and
Sculpting) across three OpenAI model generations (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5)
using the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark (1,317 problems).
  Our findings reveal a "Prompting Inversion": Sculpting provides advantages on
gpt-4o (97% vs. 93% for standard CoT), but becomes detrimental on gpt-5 (94.00%
vs. 96.36% for CoT on full benchmark). We trace this to a
"Guardrail-to-Handcuff" transition where constraints preventing common-sense
errors in mid-tier models induce hyper-literalism in advanced models. Our
detailed error analysis demonstrates that optimal prompting strategies must
co-evolve with model capabilities, suggesting simpler prompts for more capable
models.

TL;DR: SteerX是一种解耦的激活引导方法，通过因果推断理论识别偏好驱动的内容，生成更准确的个性化引导向量，提升LLM个性化效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法使用所有历史数据计算引导向量，但并非所有内容都反映真实用户偏好，这会削弱个性化信号

Method: 基于因果推断理论估计token级因果效应来识别偏好驱动token，将这些离散信号转换为连贯描述，然后用于引导个性化LLM生成

Result: 在两个代表性引导骨干方法和真实数据集上的实验表明，SteerX持续提升引导向量质量

Conclusion: SteerX通过关注真正偏好驱动信息，为更有效的LLM个性化提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years,
enabling a wide range of applications, including intelligent assistants that
support users' daily life and work. A critical factor in building such
assistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely.
Activation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user
preference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a
cost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However,
existing methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector,
ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines
the personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled
steering method that isolates preference-driven components from
preference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX
estimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens,
transforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then
leverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly
preference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation
steering vectors and enhances personalization. Experiments on two
representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets demonstrate
that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality, offering a practical
solution for more effective LLM personalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PatenTEB专利文本嵌入基准，包含15个任务、206万个样本，并开发了patembed模型家族，在专利检索和聚类任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分捕捉专利特定挑战，需要专门的专利文本嵌入评估基准。

Method: 采用领域分层分割、领域特定硬负样本挖掘，通过多任务训练开发patembed模型家族（67M-344M参数）。

Result: patembed-base在MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2上达到0.494 V-measure（之前最佳为0.445），patembed-large在DAPFAM上达到0.377 NDCG@100。

Conclusion: 多任务训练能提高外部泛化能力，领域预训练初始化在各类任务中提供一致优势。

Abstract: Patent text embeddings enable prior art search, technology landscaping, and
patent analysis, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific
challenges. We introduce PatenTEB, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 15
tasks across retrieval, classification, paraphrase, and clustering, with 2.06
million examples. PatenTEB employs domain-stratified splits, domain specific
hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric
fragment-to-document matching scenarios absent from general embedding
benchmarks. We develop the patembed model family through multi-task training,
spanning 67M to 344M parameters with context lengths up to 4096 tokens.
External validation shows strong generalization: patembed-base achieves
state-of-the-art on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445
previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM.
Systematic ablations reveal that multi-task training improves external
generalization despite minor benchmark costs, and that domain-pretrained
initialization provides consistent advantages across task families. All
resources will be made available at https://github.com/iliass-y/patenteb.

*Tu Anh Dinh,Philipp Nicolas Schumacher,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了RAG和CPT两种策略，发现在大学课程材料规模较小的情况下，RAG比CPT更有效高效，且多模态RAG（将幻灯片作为图像处理）比纯文本检索表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在大学计算机科学课程中回答问题的准确性仍存在困难，研究旨在探索如何通过整合大学课程材料来提升LLM在教育环境中的表现。

Method: 比较了两种策略：检索增强生成(RAG)和持续预训练(CPT)。对于讲座幻灯片，进一步探索了多模态RAG方法，将检索内容以图像形式呈现给生成器。

Result: 实验表明，考虑到大学课程材料的相对较小规模，RAG比CPT更有效和高效。此外，在多模态设置中将幻灯片作为图像整合，相比纯文本检索显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更好地支持学习和教学的AI助手提供了实用策略，并有望激励其他教育背景下的类似努力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. One
application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings.
However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions
accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we
investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM
performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course
materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially
from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images
and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We
compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual
Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture
slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the
retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that,
given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more
effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in
the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only
retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI
assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire
similar efforts in other educational contexts.

*Andrei Baroian*

TL;DR: 比较了BERT风格编码器、GPT-4o少样本学习和监督微调在临床命名实体识别任务上的表现，发现监督微调效果最佳但成本较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同方法在临床命名实体识别任务上的性能表现，特别是比较传统BERT模型与大语言模型的不同应用方式。

Method: 使用CADEC语料库，评估三类方法：(i) BERT风格编码器(BERT Base, BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large)；(ii) GPT-4o少样本学习(简单vs复杂提示)；(iii) GPT-4o监督微调。

Result: RoBERTa-large和BioClinicalBERT相比BERT Base改进有限；GPT-4o简单提示优于复杂提示；监督微调获得最佳性能(F1≈87.1%)但成本较高；大语言模型在简化任务(二分类)上表现更好。

Conclusion: 监督微调是临床命名实体识别的最有效方法，但需权衡成本效益；大语言模型在简化任务中具有优势；复杂提示并不总是优于简单提示。

Abstract: We study clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CADEC corpus and
compare three families of approaches: (i) BERT-style encoders (BERT Base,
BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (ii) GPT-4o used with few-shot in-context
learning (ICL) under simple vs.\ complex prompts, and (iii) GPT-4o with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). All models are evaluated on standard NER metrics
over CADEC's five entity types (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom, Finding).
RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT offer limited improvements over BERT Base,
showing the limit of these family of models. Among LLM settings, simple ICL
outperforms a longer, instruction-heavy prompt, and SFT achieves the strongest
overall performance (F1 $\approx$ 87.1%), albeit with higher cost. We find that
the LLM achieve higher accuracy on simplified tasks, restricting classification
to two labels.

Motivation: 寻求比深度神经网络更高效、更环保的语言建模方法，减少训练和推理过程中的生态足迹

Method: 实现k近邻分类的快速近似算法，完全依赖CPU运行，实现低延迟的基于记忆的语言建模

Result: OLIFANT实现与GPT-2和GPT-Neo相当的下一词预测准确率，同时显著降低排放并提高速度

Conclusion: 基于记忆的语言建模是深度神经网络语言建模的可行替代方案，具有生态友好、透明和高效的特点

Abstract: We present memory-based language modeling as an efficient, eco-friendly
alternative to deep neural network-based language modeling. It offers
log-linearly scalable next-token prediction performance and strong memorization
capabilities. Implementing fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor
classification, memory-based language modeling leaves a relatively small
ecological footprint both in training and in inference mode, as it relies fully
on CPUs and attains low token latencies. Its internal workings are simple and
fully transparent. We compare our implementation of memory-based language
modeling, OLIFANT, with GPT-2 and GPT-Neo on next-token prediction accuracy,
estimated emissions and speeds, and offer some deeper analyses of the model.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个多语言目标立场提取(TSE)基准，涵盖加泰罗尼亚语、爱沙尼亚语、法语、意大利语、汉语和西班牙语语料库，无需为每种语言单独训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体支持对争议性问题进行数据驱动的公众意见分析。虽然已有许多多语言立场分类研究，但所有先前的TSE工作仅限于英语。

Method: 将原始TSE流程扩展到多语言设置，无需为每种语言单独训练模型。

Result: 模型管道获得了12.78的F1分数，表明多语言任务相对于英语设置的难度增加，目标预测是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 这项工作为多语言TSE提供了急需的基准，包括资源、算法和评估标准，并首次展示了TSE的F1分数对不同目标表达的敏感性。

Abstract: Social media enables data-driven analysis of public opinion on contested
issues. Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) is the task of identifying the target
discussed in a document and the document's stance towards that target. Many
works classify stance towards a given target in a multilingual setting, but all
prior work in TSE is English-only. This work introduces the first multilingual
TSE benchmark, spanning Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and
Spanish corpora. It manages to extend the original TSE pipeline to a
multilingual setting without requiring separate models for each language. Our
model pipeline achieves a modest F1 score of 12.78, underscoring the increased
difficulty of the multilingual task relative to English-only setups and
highlighting target prediction as the primary bottleneck. We are also the first
to demonstrate the sensitivity of TSE's F1 score to different target
verbalizations. Together these serve as a much-needed baseline for resources,
algorithms, and evaluation criteria in multilingual TSE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAIR-RAG是一个新型的代理框架，通过结构化证据评估和迭代优化机制，显著提升了多跳问答任务的性能，在HotpotQA等基准测试中达到新的SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG框架在处理需要从不同来源综合信息的复杂多跳查询时表现不佳，缺乏系统性的证据缺口识别和填充机制，容易传播噪声或无法收集全面上下文。

Method: 提出FAIR-RAG框架，核心是结构化证据评估(SEA)模块，它将初始查询分解为所需发现清单，审计聚合证据以识别确认事实和明确信息缺口，然后通过自适应查询优化代理生成针对性子查询来检索缺失信息，直到证据充分为止。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA和MusiQue等基准测试中，FAIR-RAG显著优于强基线方法。在HotpotQA上达到0.453的F1分数，比最强的迭代基线绝对提升8.3个百分点。

Conclusion: 结构化、证据驱动的优化过程与显式缺口分析对于在复杂知识密集型任务中实现可靠准确的推理至关重要，FAIR-RAG为此类方法在这些基准上建立了新的SOTA。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination and
knowledge staleness in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing frameworks often
falter on complex, multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information from
disparate sources. Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or
adaptive strategies, lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and
fill evidence gaps, often propagating noise or failing to gather a
comprehensive context. We introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that
transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning
process. At its core is an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by a module we
term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating
mechanism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required
findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and,
critically, explicit informational gaps. These gaps provide a precise signal to
an Adaptive Query Refinement agent, which generates new, targeted sub-queries
to retrieve missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is
verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly
faithful generation. We conducted experiments on challenging multi-hop QA
benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MusiQue. In a unified
experimental setup, FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines. On
HotpotQA, it achieves an F1-score of 0.453 -- an absolute improvement of 8.3
points over the strongest iterative baseline -- establishing a new
state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks. Our work
demonstrates that a structured, evidence-driven refinement process with
explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning
in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Ironic identification is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing,
particularly when dealing with languages that differ in syntax and cultural
context. In this work, we aim to detect irony in Urdu by translating an English
Ironic Corpus into the Urdu language. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms using GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings, and compare their
performance with classical methods. Additionally, we fine-tune advanced
transformer-based models, including BERT, RoBERTa, LLaMA 2 (7B), LLaMA 3 (8B),
and Mistral, to assess the effectiveness of large-scale models in irony
detection. Among machine learning models, Gradient Boosting achieved the best
performance with an F1-score of 89.18%. Among transformer-based models, LLaMA 3
(8B) achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 94.61%. These results
demonstrate that combining transliteration techniques with modern NLP models
enables robust irony detection in Urdu, a historically low-resource language.

TL;DR: 提出了VisJudge-Bench，首个用于评估多模态大语言模型在可视化质量评估方面能力的基准，包含3,090个专家标注样本。研究发现现有MLLMs与人类专家存在显著差距，并提出了专门的可视化美学评估模型VisJudge，显著缩小了与人类判断的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化质量评估具有挑战性，需要同时判断数据编码准确性、信息表达性和视觉美学。虽然多模态大语言模型在自然图像美学评估中表现良好，但缺乏系统性的可视化评估基准。

Method: 构建VisJudge-Bench基准，包含3,090个专家标注的真实场景样本，涵盖32种图表类型。提出专门的可视化美学评估模型VisJudge。

Result: 最先进的MLLMs（如GPT-5）与人类专家存在显著差距，MAE为0.551，与人类评分相关性仅0.429。VisJudge将MAE降至0.442（减少19.8%），与人类专家一致性提升至0.681（改善58.7%）。

Conclusion: VisJudge-Bench填补了可视化质量评估基准的空白，VisJudge模型显著提升了可视化美学评估性能，为可视化质量评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an
effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value
depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and
aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is
challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across
data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics.
Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising
performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark
exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To
address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and
quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios,
covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across
32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most
advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human
experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a
correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose
VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and
quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge
significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a
19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a
58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at

Conclusion: CAP数据集为研究大语言模型在科学文本生成中的幻觉问题提供了重要资源，有助于推动幻觉检测、多语言评估和可靠科学NLP系统的发展。

Abstract: We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a
multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models
(LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain,
where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In
this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical
reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these
distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited
contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP
operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages
(English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages
(Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated
scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly
available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences
and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label
indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality
error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or
naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced
research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the
development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.

TL;DR: CHOIR是一个测试时框架，通过协调多个角色条件下的推理信号来提升LLM推理的鲁棒性，将角色差异视为建设性资源而非偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现LLM在角色分配时，即使微小的身份特征变化（如代词）也会导致推理轨迹和正确答案的差异。作者希望将这些差异作为改进推理鲁棒性的建设性资源，而非需要消除的偏见。

Method: 提出CHOIR框架，在测试时协调多个反事实角色的推理信号，通过协作解码过程动态平衡不同角色推理路径的一致性和分歧性，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，CHOIR持续提升了不同人口统计组、模型架构、规模和任务的性能，对个别组别提升达26.4%，五个组别平均提升19.2%，即使在基础角色不理想时仍有效。

Conclusion: 通过将角色差异重新定义为建设性信号，CHOIR提供了一种可扩展且泛化的方法，能够实现更可靠的LLM推理。

Abstract: Persona-assigned Large Language Models (LLMs) can adopt diverse roles,
enabling personalized and context-aware reasoning. However, even minor
demographic perturbations in personas, such as simple pronoun changes, can
alter reasoning trajectories, leading to divergent sets of correct answers.
Instead of treating these variations as biases to be mitigated, we explore
their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness. We
propose CHOIR (Collaborative Harmonization fOr Inference Robustness), a
test-time framework that harmonizes multiple persona-conditioned reasoning
signals into a unified prediction. CHOIR orchestrates a collaborative decoding
process among counterfactual personas, dynamically balancing agreement and
divergence in their reasoning paths. Experiments on various reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that CHOIR consistently enhances performance across
demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks - without additional
training. Improvements reach up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and
19.2% on average across five demographics. It remains effective even when base
personas are suboptimal. By reframing persona variation as a constructive
signal, CHOIR provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable
LLM reasoning.

Method: 通过测量音高操作对自动语音识别性能的影响，分析一组密切相关的藏语方言对音高平坦化的敏感性。

Result: 发现声调发生连续统：无音调安多方言对音高移除容忍度最高，完全音调卫藏方言显示严重性能下降，中间康方言介于两者之间。

Conclusion: 计算方法能捕捉音变的细粒度阶段，传统基于最小对立对的功能负荷度量可能高估过渡系统中对音高的依赖。

Abstract: Tonogenesis-the historical process by which segmental contrasts evolve into
lexical tone-has traditionally been studied through comparative reconstruction
and acoustic phonetics. We introduce a computational approach that quantifies
the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by
measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR)
performance. Through analysis on the sensitivity to pitch-flattening from a set
of closely related Tibetan languages, we find evidence of a tonogenesis
continuum: atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully
tonal U-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects
fall measurably between these extremes. These gradient effects demonstrate how
ASR models implicitly learn the shifting functional load of pitch as languages
transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts. Our findings
show that computational methods can capture fine-grained stages of sound change
and suggest that traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal
pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where
segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined.

*Yuanhe Tian,Junjie Liu,Xican Yang,Haishan Ye,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种简单有效的LLM剪枝方法，在缩小参数空间的同时保留任务特定能力，通过融合通用和任务特定校准数据的重要性分数来指导剪枝过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM剪枝方法主要关注保持模型生成流畅句子的能力，但忽视了特定领域和任务的性能表现。

Method: 分析传统剪枝方法在通用领域校准下的损失扰动最小化，将任务特定特征分布纳入重要性计算，计算通用和任务特定校准数据的独立重要性分数，基于激活范数差异将参数划分为共享和专属组，融合分数指导剪枝。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，该方法在相同剪枝比例和不同设置下始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够无缝集成各种基础剪枝技术，在压缩过程中保留LLM的专业能力。

Abstract: Pruning provides a practical solution to reduce the resources required to run
large language models (LLMs) to benefit from their effective capabilities as
well as control their cost for training and inference. Research on LLM pruning
often ranks the importance of LLM parameters using their magnitudes and
calibration-data activations and removes (or masks) the less important ones,
accordingly reducing LLMs' size. However, these approaches primarily focus on
preserving the LLM's ability to generate fluent sentences, while neglecting
performance on specific domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective pruning approach for LLMs that preserves task-specific
capabilities while shrinking their parameter space. We first analyze how
conventional pruning minimizes loss perturbation under general-domain
calibration and extend this formulation by incorporating task-specific feature
distributions into the importance computation of existing pruning algorithms.
Thus, our framework computes separate importance scores using both general and
task-specific calibration data, partitions parameters into shared and exclusive
groups based on activation-norm differences, and then fuses their scores to
guide the pruning process. This design enables our method to integrate
seamlessly with various foundation pruning techniques and preserve the LLM's
specialized abilities under compression. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach is effective and consistently outperforms the
baselines with identical pruning ratios and different settings.

*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 分析Whisper多语言ASR模型在49种语言上的解码行为，发现子词发现率遵循一致的指数饱和模式，提出声学饱和时间(AST)概念，表明子词利用更多受语音统计、类型和正字法结构约束而非训练数据规模影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言ASR模型在不同语言中学习的子词库存的利用模式，探讨预训练数据差异是否影响推理过程中这些子词的利用情况。

Method: 通过记录49种语言推理过程中的解码候选子词，跟踪它们随时间累积的发现情况，分析模型子词空间的利用模式。

Result: 发现子词总数与语言预训练时长无关，子词发现率呈现指数饱和模式，拉丁文字语言比西里尔、CJK和闪米特文字语言表现更好，子词平均长度与资源水平正相关。

Conclusion: 多语言ASR推理中的子词利用更多受语音统计、类型和正字法结构约束，而非训练数据规模，为更公平的语料构建和跨语言评估提供实证基础。

Abstract: How much audio is needed to fully observe a multilingual ASR model's learned
sub-token inventory across languages, and does data disparity in multilingual
pre-training affect how these tokens are utilized during inference? We address
this question by analyzing Whisper's decoding behavior during inference across
49 languages. By logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their
cumulative discovery over time, we study the utilization pattern of the model's
sub-token space. Results show that the total number of discovered tokens
remains largely independent of a language's pre-training hours, indicating that
data disparity does not strongly influence lexical diversity in the model's
hypothesis space. Sub-token discovery rates follow a consistent exponential
saturation pattern across languages, suggesting a stable time window after
which additional audio yields minimal new sub-token activation. We refer to
this convergence threshold as acoustic saturation time (AST). Further analyses
of rank-frequency distributions reveal Zipf-like patterns better modeled by a
Zipf-Mandelbrot law, and mean sub-token length shows a positive correlation
with resource level. Additionally, those metrics show more favorable patterns
for languages in the Latin script than those in scripts such as Cyrillic, CJK,
and Semitic. Together, our study suggests that sub-token utilization during
multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by the statistical, typological,
and orthographic structure of the speech than by training data scale, providing
an empirical basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对四个商业ASR系统的种族偏见评估，发现语音特征差异是偏见主要来源，特别是非洲裔美国人语音识别错误率最高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估商业自动语音识别系统中的种族偏见，分析不同种族背景说话者的转录准确性差异。

Method: 使用太平洋西北英语语料库，分析四个种族群体的语音数据，引入语音错误率指标评估11个社会语音特征。

Result: 发现元音质量变化与错误率差异相关，非洲裔美国人语音在所有系统中错误率最高，语音变异建模是偏见主要来源。

Conclusion: 商业ASR系统存在基于语音变异的种族偏见，需要通过在训练数据中更好地代表社会语音多样性来改进系统性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of racial bias in four major
commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the Pacific
Northwest English (PNWE) corpus. We analyze transcription accuracy across
speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American,
ChicanX, and Yakama) and examine how sociophonetic variation contributes to
differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined
Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific
linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our
analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation,
particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns,
is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic
groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across
all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of
dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains
a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the
PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies
and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted
representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.

*Noshitha Padma Pratyusha Juttu,Sahithi Singireddy,Sravani Gona,Sujal Timilsina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了在服务条款不公平条款检测任务中，全量微调、参数高效适配（LoRA、QLoRA）和零样本提示三种策略的效果，发现全量微调在精度-召回平衡上表现最佳，而LoRA方法在显著降低内存成本的同时保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本理解方面表现出色，但在专业法律领域的应用受到全量微调成本的限制，需要探索更高效的适配方法。

Method: 对BERT和DistilBERT进行全量微调，对TinyLlama、LLaMA 3B/7B和SaulLM应用4位低秩适配（LoRA），并在零样本设置下评估GPT-4o及其变体。使用CLAUDETTE-ToS基准和多语言抓取语料库进行实验。

Result: 全量微调在精度-召回平衡方面表现最强，而基于LoRA的模型在内存成本降低高达3倍的情况下仍能提供具有竞争力的召回率。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了高效且领域适应的LLMs在实际设计中的权衡，为法律文本处理中的微调研究提供了开放的基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text understanding, yet their
adaptation to specialized legal domains remains constrained by the cost of full
fine-tuning. This study provides a systematic evaluation of fine tuning,
parameter efficient adaptation (LoRA, QLoRA), and zero-shot prompting
strategies for unfair clause detection in Terms of Service (ToS) documents, a
key application in legal NLP. We finetune BERT and DistilBERT, apply 4-bit
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to models such as TinyLlama, LLaMA 3B/7B, and
SaulLM, and evaluate GPT-4o and O-versions in zero-shot settings. Experiments
on the CLAUDETTE-ToS benchmark and the Multilingual Scraper Corpus show that
full fine-tuning achieves the strongest precision recall balance, while
LoRA-based models provide competitive recall with up to 3x lower memory cost.
These findings highlight practical design trade-offs for efficient and
domain-adapted LLMs, contributing open baselines for fine-tuning research in
legal text processing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LooGLE v2是一个评估大语言模型在现实世界长上下文应用中能力的基准测试，包含16k到2M token的真实长文本，涵盖法律、金融、游戏和代码等领域，设计了10种领域特定的长依赖任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型的上下文窗口不断扩展，但它们在长依赖任务上的理解能力仍然有限且未被充分探索，特别是在许多现实世界长上下文应用中。

Method: 通过自动收集真实世界长文本，设计10种领域特定的长依赖任务，生成1,934个QA实例，使用可扩展的数据整理流程，评估了6个本地部署和4个基于API的大语言模型。

Result: 评估结果显示，即使在最佳表现的模型上，在基准测试中的总体得分仅为59.2%。流行的大语言模型只能理解比其声称长度短得多的上下文。

Conclusion: 尽管上下文窗口广泛，大语言模型在处理具有长依赖关系的现实世界任务方面存在显著局限性，表明在实际长上下文理解方面还有很大的改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with increasingly extended context
windows recently, yet their long context understanding capabilities over long
dependency tasks remain fundamentally limited and underexplored. This gap is
especially significant in many real-world long-context applications that were
rarely benchmarked. In this paper, we introduce LooGLE v2, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs' long context ability in real-world applications and
scenarios. Our benchmark consists of automatically collected real-world long
texts, ranging from 16k to 2M tokens, encompassing domains in law, finance,
game and code. Accordingly, we delicately design 10 types of domain-specific
long-dependency tasks and generate 1,934 QA instances with various diversity
and complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical
needs. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of 6 locally deployed and 4
API-based LLMs. The evaluation results show that even the best-performing model
achieves only a 59.2% overall score on our benchmark. Despite the extensive
context windows, popular LLMs are only capable of understanding a much shorter
length of context than they claim to be, revealing significant limitations in
their ability to handle real-world tasks with long dependencies and
highlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical long-context
understanding.

*Jinhan Chen,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Xianjun Gao,Shilong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABlock是一个语义感知的KV缓存驱逐框架，通过自适应块大小来平衡语义连贯性和内存效率，显著减少长上下文LLM推理中的KV缓存内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存不断增长的内存占用已成为长上下文LLM推理的严重可扩展性瓶颈，现有压缩方法难以平衡语义连贯性和内存效率。

Method: SABlock首先进行语义分割以对齐压缩边界与语言结构，然后应用分段引导的令牌评分来优化令牌重要性估计，最后通过预算驱动的搜索策略自适应确定最优块大小。

Result: 在长上下文基准测试中，SABlock在相同内存预算下始终优于最先进的基线方法。在NIAH测试中，仅用96个KV条目就实现了99.9%的检索准确率，在128K上下文长度下减少峰值内存使用46.28%，解码速度提升高达9.5倍。

Conclusion: SABlock通过语义感知的自适应块大小策略，有效解决了KV缓存内存占用问题，在保持语义完整性的同时显著提高了压缩效率和解码性能。

Abstract: The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe
scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less
critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression
methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this
end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction
framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically,
SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries
with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine
token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search
strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic
integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget.
Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory
budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9%
retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of
the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache
budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and
achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.

TL;DR: 提出了EduLoop-Agent端到端个性化学习代理，整合神经认知诊断模型、自适应测试策略和大型语言模型，形成诊断-推荐-反馈的闭环框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将建模、题目选择和反馈孤立处理，导致学生模型粗糙、适应性受限、反馈不具操作性。需要构建闭环的个性化学习系统。

Method: 结合神经认知诊断模型(NCD)进行细粒度知识掌握评估，使用有界能力估计自适应测试(BECAT)动态选题，利用LLM生成结构化可操作反馈。

Result: 在ASSISTments数据集上，NCD模块在响应预测和可解释掌握评估方面表现良好，自适应推荐提高了题目相关性和个性化，LLM反馈能提供针对性学习指导。

Conclusion: 该设计有效且可实际部署，为智能教育中生成个性化学习路径提供了可行途径。

Abstract: As information technology advances, education is moving from
one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning. However, most
methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than
as a closed loop. This leads to coarse or opaque student models,
assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic,
non-actionable feedback. To address these limitations, this paper presents an
end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a
Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation
Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models
(LLMs). The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at
the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to
maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals
into structured, actionable feedback. Together, these components form a
closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.'' Experiments
on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance
on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments. The
adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization,
and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with
identified weaknesses. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design
is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to
generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.

Motivation: 生成式AI模型加速了LLM驱动的智能辅导系统发展，但这些系统的进展和影响难以追踪，因为缺乏可靠、通用且基于教学理论的评估框架和基准。现有评估方法依赖主观协议和非标准化基准，导致不一致性和有限泛化性。

Method: 通过回顾最先进的评估实践，结合真实案例研究，分析相关挑战。基于跨学科AIED研究的洞察，提出三个实用、可行且理论扎实的研究方向。

Result: 识别了当前ITS评估中的关键问题：缺乏标准化框架、主观评估协议、有限泛化性。通过案例研究展示了这些挑战在实践中的表现。

Conclusion: 需要建立基于学习科学原理的公平、统一、可扩展的评估方法，以推动LLM驱动的智能辅导系统的可靠发展和评估。

Abstract: The interdisciplinary research domain of Artificial Intelligence in Education
(AIED) has a long history of developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) by
integrating insights from technological advancements, educational theories, and
cognitive psychology. The remarkable success of generative AI (GenAI) models
has accelerated the development of large language model (LLM)-powered ITSs,
which have potential to imitate human-like, pedagogically rich, and cognitively
demanding tutoring. However, the progress and impact of these systems remain
largely untraceable due to the absence of reliable, universally accepted, and
pedagogy-driven evaluation frameworks and benchmarks. Most existing educational
dialogue-based ITS evaluations rely on subjective protocols and
non-standardized benchmarks, leading to inconsistencies and limited
generalizability. In this work, we take a step back from mainstream ITS
development and provide comprehensive state-of-the-art evaluation practices,
highlighting associated challenges through real-world case studies from careful
and caring AIED research. Finally, building on insights from previous
interdisciplinary AIED research, we propose three practical, feasible, and
theoretically grounded research directions, rooted in learning science
principles and aimed at establishing fair, unified, and scalable evaluation
methodologies for ITSs.

Motivation: 传统静态基准测试存在测试集污染和有限适应性问题，需要一种能够持续评估不断发展的语言模型的污染抵抗性替代方案。

Method: 采用相互同行评估方法，模型轮流充当问题生成器、参赛者和评委，通过迭代加权机制放大可靠评估者的影响力，将同行判断聚合成基于共识的排名。

Result: 实验显示与MMLU-Pro和GPQA基准测试分别有78%和63%的强相关性，多评委设计显著优于单评委基线，分布式评估产生更稳健和与人类一致的评估。

Conclusion: AutoBench为不断发展的语言模型提供了一种可扩展、污染抵抗性的连续评估替代方案，验证了同行驱动评估范式的有效性。

Abstract: We present AutoBench, a fully automated and self-sustaining framework for
evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through reciprocal peer assessment.
This paper provides a rigorous scientific validation of the AutoBench
methodology, originally developed as an open-source project by eZecute S.R.L..
Unlike static benchmarks that suffer from test-set contamination and limited
adaptability, AutoBench dynamically generates novel evaluation tasks while
models alternately serve as question generators, contestants, and judges across
diverse domains. An iterative weighting mechanism amplifies the influence of
consistently reliable evaluators, aggregating peer judgments into
consensus-based rankings that reflect collective model agreement. Our
experiments demonstrate strong correlations with established benchmarks
including MMLU-Pro and GPQA (respectively 78\% and 63\%), validating this
peer-driven evaluation paradigm. The multi-judge design significantly
outperforms single-judge baselines, confirming that distributed evaluation
produces more robust and human-consistent assessments. AutoBench offers a
scalable, contamination-resistant alternative to static benchmarks for the
continuous evaluation of evolving language models.

Result: 人类标注者准确率89%，OpenAI-o3达到92.18%，DeepSeek-R1为82.51%，显示数据集具有挑战性。DRESS-AF方法在英语HellaSwag基准上也有效。

Conclusion: PerCoR填补了波斯语常识推理基准的空白，展示了现有模型与人类表现之间的差距，DRESS-AF方法具有可迁移性。

Abstract: We introduced PerCoR (Persian Commonsense Reasoning), the first large-scale
Persian benchmark for commonsense reasoning. PerCoR contains 106K
multiple-choice sentence-completion problems drawn from more than forty news,
cultural, and other web sources. We introduce a novel conjunction-based
segmentation strategy to generate coherent sentence-completion pairs, enabling
broad topical and structural diversity. To create challenging distractors, we
propose DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and
Adversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that
selects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model
confusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the
highest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%).
The strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both
the dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian
commonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English
HellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human
solvability. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Preserving linguistic diversity is necessary as every language offers a
distinct perspective on the world. There have been numerous global initiatives
to preserve endangered languages through documentation. This paper is a part of
a project which aims to develop a trilingual (Toto-Bangla-English) language
learning application to digitally archive and promote the endangered Toto
language of West Bengal, India. This application, designed for both native Toto
speakers and non-native learners, aims to revitalize the language by ensuring
accessibility and usability through Unicode script integration and a structured
language corpus. The research includes detailed linguistic documentation
collected via fieldwork, followed by the creation of a morpheme-tagged,
trilingual corpus used to train a Small Language Model (SLM) and a
Transformer-based translation engine. The analysis covers inflectional
morphology such as person-number-gender agreement, tense-aspect-mood
distinctions, and case marking, alongside derivational strategies that reflect
word-class changes. Script standardization and digital literacy tools were also
developed to enhance script usage. The study offers a sustainable model for
preserving endangered languages by incorporating traditional linguistic
methodology with AI. This bridge between linguistic research with technological
innovation highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration for
community-based language revitalization.

Conclusion: CR-FKGC框架有效提升了少样本知识图谱补全的性能，能够更好地处理复杂关系和数据稀疏问题。

Abstract: Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) infers missing triples from
limited support samples, tackling long-tail distribution challenges. Existing
methods, however, struggle to capture complex relational patterns and mitigate
data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FKGC framework
for conjugate relation modeling (CR-FKGC). Specifically, it employs a
neighborhood aggregation encoder to integrate higher-order neighbor
information, a conjugate relation learner combining an implicit conditional
diffusion relation module with a stable relation module to capture stable
semantics and uncertainty offsets, and a manifold conjugate decoder for
efficient evaluation and inference of missing triples in manifold space.
Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods.

to apply rules to explain the emerging class of large language models (LLMs)
with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Since RAG enables LLM systems to
incorporate retrieved information sources at inference time, rules linking the
presence or absence of sources can explain output provenance; e.g., "if a Times
Higher Education ranking article is retrieved, then the LLM ranks Oxford
first." To generate such rules, a brute force approach would probe the LLM with
all source combinations and check if the presence or absence of any sources
leads to the same output. We propose optimizations to speed up rule generation,
inspired by Apriori-like pruning from frequent itemset mining but redefined
within the scope of our novel problem. We conclude with qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrating our solutions' value and efficiency.

TL;DR: SALSA是一个结合结构化提示、类别到标记映射和参数高效微调的文本分类方法，通过单次前向传播实现高效准确的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管指令调优的大语言模型具有强大的泛化能力，但在文本分类基准测试中表现不佳，需要改进分类性能。

Method: 将每个类别标签映射到不同的输出标记，构建提示以引出单标记响应，在推理时仅将模型输出投影到相关类别标记的logits上。

Result: SALSA在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，证明了其在基于LLM的分类应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: SALSA通过避免冷启动训练，提供了一种高效准确的LLM文本分类解决方案，在各种基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, instruction-tuned Large
Language Models often underperform on text classification benchmarks. We
introduce SALSA, a coherent pipeline that combines structured prompting,
class-to-token mapping, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thereby avoiding
cold-start training. Each class label is mapped to a distinct output token, and
prompts are constructed to elicit a single-token response. During inference,
the model's output is projected only onto the logits of the relevant class
tokens, enabling efficient and accurate classification in a single forward
pass. SALSA achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks,
demonstrating its robustness and scalability for LLM-based classification
applications.

Conclusion: 单个嵌入模型能有效统一检索和重排序，在计算效率和排序准确性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search
applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space,
they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However,
their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,
especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained
query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient
Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single
text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise
reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective,
thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying
cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified
ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the
original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query
enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance
feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the
efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while
significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically,
$\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR
reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the
reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also
show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the
MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can
effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational
efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

Conclusion: 参数高效微调的持续预训练能够通过提供成本效益高且可持续的语言资源创建来缩小方言差距，扩展高质量大语言模型对少数民族语言社区的访问。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), their
strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of
high-resource languages for which there is abundant training data. Recently,
continual pre-training (CPT) has emerged as a means to fine-tune these models
to low-resource regional dialects. In this paper, we study the use of CPT for
dialect learning under tight data and compute budgets. Using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient continual pre-training, we adapt three
LLMs to the Qu\'ebec French dialect using a very small dataset and benchmark
them on the COLE suite. Our experiments demonstrate an improvement on the
minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on the prestige language
benchmarks with under 1% of model parameters updated. Analysis of the results
demonstrate that gains are highly contingent on corpus composition. These
findings indicate that CPT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can
narrow the dialect gap by providing cost-effective and sustainable language
resource creation, expanding high-quality LLM access to minority linguistic
communities. We release the first Qu\'ebec French LLMs on HuggingFace.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何基于时间关系检索上下文信息，类比人类情景记忆的时间分离机制，研究不同预训练模型对时间分离事件的区分和检索能力。

Method: 通过固定重复标记位置并置换其他标记来消除语义混淆，隔离时间效应对下一个标记预测的影响。使用包含多个相同标记出现的序列，分析transformer和状态空间模型的表现。

Result: 模型在预测下一个标记时，对重复标记后的标记赋予最高概率，但存在明显的偏向性——更倾向于序列开头或结尾的标记。中间嵌入的记忆检索可靠性较低。transformer和状态空间模型显示出相似的时间偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了上下文学习中的时间偏差机制，这些偏差能够实现时间分离和情景检索，深化了对大型语言模型记忆检索机制的理解。

Abstract: In-context learning is governed by both temporal and semantic relationships,
shaping how Large Language Models (LLMs) retrieve contextual information.
Analogous to human episodic memory, where the retrieval of specific events is
enabled by separating events that happened at different times, this work probes
the ability of various pretrained LLMs, including transformer and state-space
models, to differentiate and retrieve temporally separated events.
Specifically, we prompted models with sequences containing multiple
presentations of the same token, which reappears at the sequence end. By fixing
the positions of these repeated tokens and permuting all others, we removed
semantic confounds and isolated temporal effects on next-token prediction.
Across diverse sequences, models consistently placed the highest probabilities
on tokens following a repeated token, but with a notable bias for those nearest
the beginning or end of the input. An ablation experiment linked this
phenomenon in transformers to induction heads. Extending the analysis to unique
semantic contexts with partial overlap further demonstrated that memories
embedded in the middle of a prompt are retrieved less reliably. Despite
architectural differences, state-space and transformer models showed comparable
temporal biases. Our findings deepen the understanding of temporal biases in
in-context learning and offer an illustration of how these biases can enable
temporal separation and episodic retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估语言、声学、推理或对话能力，忽视了这些技能在实现类人、情感智能对话中的整合需求。

Method: 设计了首个相互关联的多层次基准测试，通过顺序、上下文关联的任务模拟移情对话的认知过程，使用语义中性脚本和受控的声音风格变化。

Result: 测试12个先进SLM显示，即使最先进的模型在处理高表达性声音线索方面也存在困难，限制了移情回应的质量。

Conclusion: SLM需要整合语言内容和多样化声音线索，才能实现真正的移情对话能力。

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) have made significant progress in spoken
language understanding. Yet it remains unclear whether they can fully perceive
non lexical vocal cues alongside spoken words, and respond with empathy that
aligns with both emotional and contextual factors. Existing benchmarks
typically evaluate linguistic, acoustic, reasoning, or dialogue abilities in
isolation, overlooking the integration of these skills that is crucial for
human-like, emotionally intelligent conversation. We present EchoMind, the
first interrelated, multi-level benchmark that simulates the cognitive process
of empathetic dialogue through sequential, context-linked tasks: spoken-content
understanding, vocal-cue perception, integrated reasoning, and response
generation. All tasks share identical and semantically neutral scripts that are
free of explicit emotional or contextual cues, and controlled variations in
vocal style are used to test the effect of delivery independent of the
transcript. EchoMind is grounded in an empathy-oriented framework spanning 3
coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions, encompassing 39 vocal attributes, and
evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics. Testing 12 advanced SLMs
reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with high-expressive vocal
cues, limiting empathetic response quality. Analyses of prompt strength, speech
source, and ideal vocal cue recognition reveal persistent weaknesses in
instruction-following, resilience to natural speech variability, and effective
use of vocal cues for empathy. These results underscore the need for SLMs that
integrate linguistic content with diverse vocal cues to achieve truly
empathetic conversational ability.

TL;DR: MMPersuade是一个研究大型视觉语言模型在多媒体说服内容中易感性的框架，发现多媒体输入显著增强说服效果，特别是在错误信息场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LVLMs在购物、健康、新闻等领域的部署，它们面临大量说服性内容。了解模型如何被多媒体说服内容影响至关重要，因为过度易感的模型可能采纳误导性信念、覆盖用户偏好或生成不道德输出。

Method: 开发了MMPersuade框架，包含(i)包含图像和视频的多媒体数据集，涵盖商业、主观行为和对抗性场景的说服原则；(ii)通过第三方协议评分和自估计令牌概率评估说服效果和模型易感性的框架。

Result: 对六个领先LVLMs的研究发现：(i)多媒体输入相比纯文本显著增强说服效果和模型易感性；(ii)明确声明的先前偏好降低易感性，但多媒体仍保持说服优势；(iii)不同策略在不同场景中效果各异，互惠性在商业和主观场景最有效，可信度和逻辑在对抗性场景占优。

Conclusion: MMPersuade通过联合分析说服效果和易感性，为开发在面对多媒体说服内容时更稳健、偏好一致且符合伦理的模型提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: As Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains
such as shopping, health, and news, they are exposed to pervasive persuasive
content. A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and
why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both
their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different
persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt
misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe
outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a
unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in
LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs
images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial,
subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation
framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model
susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token
probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as
persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially
increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text
alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences
decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive
advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across
contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective
contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By
jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade
provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust,
preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive
multimodal content.

TL;DR: R4P是一个基于推理的补丁验证模型，为软件工程代理提供可扩展的奖励机制，解决了传统基于测试的监督方法在可扩展性和稳定性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于测试的监督方法存在两个问题：(1) 构建和运行测试沙盒既繁重又脆弱；(2) 具有高覆盖率测试的数据稀缺且容易受到通过边缘案例进行测试黑客攻击的威胁。

Method: R4P将补丁验证视为推理任务，模仿人类仓库维护者在不编写和运行新测试的情况下审查补丁的方式。采用分组目标进行强化学习训练，能够验证多个补丁并相互比较修改，获得稳定的密集奖励。

Result: R4P在SWE-bench-verified上达到72.2%的补丁验证准确率，超越OpenAI o3。基于R4P训练的Mini-SE在SWE-bench-verified上达到26.2% Pass@1，比原始Qwen3-32B提升10.0%。使用R4P进行测试时扩展可进一步提升至32.8%。R4P验证补丁仅需1秒，比平均测试速度快50倍。

Conclusion: R4P通过推理驱动的补丁验证提供了可扩展、高效的奖励机制，显著提升了软件工程代理的性能和训练稳定性，展示了在软件工程任务中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: While large language model agents have advanced software engineering tasks,
the unscalable nature of existing test-based supervision is limiting the
potential improvement of data scaling. The reason is twofold: (1) building and
running test sandbox is rather heavy and fragile, and (2) data with
high-coverage tests is naturally rare and threatened by test hacking via edge
cases. In this paper, we propose R4P, a patch verifier model to provide
scalable rewards for training and testing SWE agents via reasoning. We consider
that patch verification is fundamentally a reasoning task, mirroring how human
repository maintainers review patches without writing and running new
reproduction tests. To obtain sufficient reference and reduce the risk of
reward hacking, R4P uses a group-wise objective for RL training, enabling it to
verify multiple patches against each other's modification and gain a dense
reward for stable training. R4P achieves 72.2% Acc. for verifying patches from
SWE-bench-verified, surpassing OpenAI o3. To demonstrate R4P's practicality, we
design and train a lite scaffold, Mini-SE, with pure reinforcement learning
where all rewards are derived from R4P. As a result, Mini-SE achieves 26.2%
Pass@1 on SWE-bench-verified, showing a 10.0% improvement over the original
Qwen3-32B. This can be further improved to 32.8% with R4P for test-time
scaling. Furthermore, R4P verifies patches within a second, 50x faster than
testing on average. The stable scaling curves of rewards and accuracy along
with high efficiency reflect R4P's practicality.

Motivation: 人道组织面临选择：投资昂贵的商业API还是依赖免费开源模型进行多语言人权监控。商业系统可靠但昂贵，开源替代品缺乏实证验证，特别是在冲突地区常见的低资源语言中。

Method: 在78,000次多语言推理中评估6个模型（4个指令对齐模型和2个开源模型），使用标准分类指标和新的跨语言可靠性度量：校准偏差、决策偏差、语言鲁棒性评分和语言稳定性评分。

Result: 对齐模型在类型学上遥远和低资源语言中保持近乎不变的准确性和平衡校准，而开源模型表现出显著的提示语言敏感性和校准漂移。对齐（而非规模）决定了稳定性。

Conclusion: 多语言对齐实现了语言无关的推理，为人道组织在多语言部署中平衡预算约束与可靠性提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Humanitarian organizations face a critical choice: invest in costly
commercial APIs or rely on free open-weight models for multilingual human
rights monitoring. While commercial systems offer reliability, open-weight
alternatives lack empirical validation -- especially for low-resource languages
common in conflict zones. This paper presents the first systematic comparison
of commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for
human-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the
cost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across
78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four
instruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0,
GPT-4.1-mini) and two open-weight (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) -- using both
standard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability:
Calibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS),
and Language Stability Score (LSS). Results show that alignment, not scale,
determines stability: aligned models maintain near-invariant accuracy and
balanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages
(e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibit significant
prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. These findings demonstrate
that multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning and provide
practical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints
with reliability in multilingual deployment.

Abstract: Understanding how ideas develop and flow in small-group conversations is
critical for analyzing collaborative learning. A key structural feature of
these interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes
into interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been
widely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous
spoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.
At the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating
discourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on
tracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether
explicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in
group talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in
synchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting
strategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences
performance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that
capture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.
Our results show that providing clear conversational thread information
improves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of
downstream analysis on well-structured dialogue. We also discuss practical
trade-offs in time and cost, emphasizing where human-AI hybrid approaches can
yield the best value. Together, this work advances methods for combining LLMs
and robust conversational thread structures to make sense of complex, real-time
group interactions.

Motivation: 现有方法如CoT和PoT在复杂多步推理中仍会产生不理想的解决方案，特别是在算法领域，需要更有效的推理增强方法。

Method: 提出PIPS方法，在实例层面生成和优化程序，使用结构反馈而不依赖任务特定指导或显式测试用例，并引入置信度指标动态选择推理策略。

Result: 在3个前沿LLM和30个基准测试中，PIPS相比PoT和CoT分别提升绝对调和平均准确率8.6%和9.4%，在算法任务中减少65.1%的不良程序生成。

Conclusion: PIPS通过实例级程序合成和动态策略选择，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能，减少了不良解决方案的产生。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to
struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs
with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of
Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions,
especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis
(PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level
using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit
test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence
metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis
on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30
benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question
answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks
show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and
9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program
generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with
Gemini-2.0-Flash.

Motivation: 现有语言模型的内部表示高度"纠缠"，混合了词汇、句法、语义和推理信息，这使得脑编码分析偏向浅层语言特征，难以分离深层认知过程的神经基础。

Method: 采用残差解缠方法，首先探测语言模型识别特征特定层，然后迭代回归掉低层表示，生成四个近乎正交的嵌入：词汇、句法、语义和推理。

Result: 1) 推理嵌入具有独特预测能力，能解释其他语言特征无法解释的神经活动方差；2) 推理神经信号时间上更晚出现(350-400ms)；3) 标准未解缠嵌入会误导分析，其预测成功主要归因于浅层语言特征。

Conclusion: 该方法成功分离了语言处理的不同认知成分，揭示了推理处理的独特神经特征，为理解人脑从简单语言处理到高级推理的进展提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple
linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge
in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are
highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and
reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward
linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult
to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we
introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these
components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our
method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four
nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically,
reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG)
brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We
show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive
power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other
linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions
beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is
temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to
lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing
hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as
their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow
features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

*Tiasa Singha Roy,Ayush Rajesh Jhaveri,Ilias Triantafyllopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs存在不确定性现象，即模型在重新提示时会改变之前正确的答案。通过识别并屏蔽一小部分非检索注意力头，可以减少15%的翻转行为，但下游任务存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在不确定性行为，这会破坏信任并在高风险领域带来严重风险，因此需要研究其机制并找到缓解方法。

Method: 采用Needle-in-a-Haystack检索框架，集成Flip式重新评估提示来模拟答案翻转场景，识别并屏蔽导致不确定性的注意力头。

Result: 发现检索头不是避免不确定性的主要原因，而是少数非检索注意力头过度关注误导性标记。屏蔽这些头可减少15%的翻转行为，且不会引入不连贯或过度修正。

Conclusion: 研究为机制可解释性领域做出贡献，提供了一种简单有效的技术来缓解LLMs中的不确定性驱动故障模式，但下游任务存在权衡。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
unwanted uncertainty, a phenomenon where a model changes a previously correct
answer into an incorrect one when re-prompted. This behavior undermines trust
and poses serious risks in high-stakes domains. In this work, we investigate
the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon. We adapt the Needle-in-a-Haystack
retrieval framework and integrate a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to simulate
realistic answer-flipping scenarios. We find that retrieval heads are not
primarily responsible for avoiding uncertainty. Instead, we identify a small
set of non-retrieval attention heads that disproportionately attend to
misleading tokens in uncertain contexts. Masking these heads yields significant
improvements, reducing flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing
incoherence or overcorrection. However, when tested for downstream tasks, we
observe trade-offs with flip behavior. Our findings contribute to the growing
field of mechanistic interpretability and present a simple yet effective
technique for mitigating uncertainty-driven failure modes in LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本越来越像人类写作，需要大规模、多样化且标注良好的数据集来可靠检测AI生成文本并将其归因到特定模型。

Method: 创建包含真实纽约时报文章和多个先进LLM（包括Gemma-2-9b、Mistral-7B、Qwen-2-72B、LLaMA-8B、Yi-Large和GPT-4-o）生成文本的数据集，提供原始文章摘要作为提示和完整的人类撰写叙述。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
human-like AI-generated text, raising concerns about content authenticity,
misinformation, and trustworthiness. Addressing the challenge of reliably
detecting AI-generated text and attributing it to specific models requires
large-scale, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. In this work, we present a
comprehensive dataset comprising over 58,000 text samples that combine
authentic New York Times articles with synthetic versions generated by multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs including Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, Qwen-2-72B, LLaMA-8B,
Yi-Large, and GPT-4-o. The dataset provides original article abstracts as
prompts, full human-authored narratives. We establish baseline results for two
key tasks: distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text, achieving an
accuracy of 58.35\%, and attributing AI texts to their generating models with
an accuracy of 8.92\%. By bridging real-world journalistic content with modern
generative models, the dataset aims to catalyze the development of robust
detection and attribution methods, fostering trust and transparency in the era
of generative AI. Our dataset is available at:

*Ranran Haoran Zhang,Soumik Dey,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了EQSPEC和EXSPEC两种批量推测解码方法，解决了批量处理中的不规则张量问题，在保持输出等价性的同时显著提升了推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批量推测解码在生产环境中至关重要，但会引入不规则张量问题，导致位置ID、注意力掩码和KV缓存状态损坏，现有实现违反了输出等价性要求。

Method: 首先分析同步需求保证正确性，提出EQSPEC方法暴露重新对齐开销，然后引入EXSPEC方法维护滑动序列池并动态形成等长组，减少重新对齐开销。

Result: 在SpecBench数据集上，使用Vicuna-7B/68M、Qwen3-8B/0.6B和GLM-4-9B/0.6B目标/草稿模型对，在批量大小为8时相比批量大小为1实现了最高3倍的吞吐量提升，保持95%的输出等价性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需自定义内核，可无缝集成到现有推理栈中，有效解决了批量推测解码中的不规则张量问题，同时保持了输出等价性和推理效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to
propose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending
this idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the
ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of
draft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention
masks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations
violate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative
decoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive
generation. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the
ragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization
requirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch
speculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of
overhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences
and dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead
while preserving per-sequence speculative speedups. On the SpecBench dataset,
across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B target/draft pairs, our
approach achieves up to 3$\times$ throughput improvement at batch size 8
compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8, while
maintaining 95% output equivalence. Our method requires no custom kernels and
integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生幻觉API和错误定位编辑，而语言服务器能计算关于真实代码的已验证、IDE级事实。

Method: 提出了选择器DSL、确定性分析包、安全操作信封和基于语言服务器事实的过程奖励函数。

Result: 建立了在冻结快照下的确定性形式化，并为过程奖励建立了单调性属性。

Conclusion: 语言服务器不仅提供结构信息，还提供可操作的过程奖励，使代理的规划循环与程序现实对齐。

Abstract: Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while
language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present
Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language
Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic,
replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only
structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also
an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an
agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI
contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via
a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a
principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that
normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata
with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations
(rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware,
transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language
Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply
checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize
determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for
the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and
counterfactual analysis. Project Page:

TL;DR: 提出了Infinity-Chat数据集，用于评估语言模型在开放性问题上的多样性，揭示了语言模型存在严重的模式崩溃和人工蜂群效应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在生成多样化、类人创意内容方面存在困难，长期接触相似输出可能导致人类思想的同质化，但目前缺乏评估LM输出多样性的可扩展方法。

Method: 构建了包含26K个多样化、真实世界开放性问题的大规模数据集Infinity-Chat，并建立了包含6个顶级类别和17个子类别的完整分类法。通过31,250个人类标注研究集体和个人特定的人类偏好。

Result: 发现语言模型在开放生成中存在明显的模式崩溃，表现为(1)模型内重复和(2)模型间同质性的人工蜂群效应。LM、奖励模型和LM评判器在引发不同个体偏好的模型生成上对人类评分的校准较差。

Conclusion: Infinity-Chat为系统研究真实世界开放性问题提供了首个大规模资源，揭示了减轻人工蜂群效应带来的长期AI安全风险的关键见解。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative
content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought
through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for
evaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks
such as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a
single model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,
real-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible
answers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive
taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to
LMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that
further breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a
large-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial
Hivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)
intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar
responses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models
produce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human
annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25
independent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and
individual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our
findings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated
to human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic
annotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall,
INFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically
studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to
guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the
Artificial Hivemind.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在长文本问答和推理方面存在有效上下文长度限制，而RAG等方法依赖复杂的预处理和检索策略。

Method: 通过在上下文或提示中添加标签定义来增强数据，保持文档完整性。

Result: 在NoLima和NovelQA基准测试中，32K token上下文性能提升达17%，复杂推理问答提升2.9%。

Conclusion: TAG是一种有效的轻量级数据增强方法，能显著提升LLM在长文本场景下的表现。

Abstract: Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large
language models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question
answering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the
largest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to
mitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval
strategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,
knowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose
Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy
that boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and
altering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our
hypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant
question-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging
the context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to
consistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token
contexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop
queries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text. Additional details are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生物医学、法律和教育等高风险领域的广泛应用引发了对其输出事实准确性的担忧，现有评估方法在长文本上表现不佳。

Method: 构建LongHalluQA中文长文本事实性数据集；开发基于辩论的多智能体验证系统MAD-Fact；引入事实重要性层次结构来捕捉长文本中不同声明的重要性差异。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的实验表明，更大的LLM通常保持更高的事实一致性，而国内模型在中文内容上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估和增强长文本LLM输出的事实可靠性提供了一个结构化框架，指导其在敏感领域的安全部署。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises critical
concerns about the factual accuracy of their outputs, especially in high-risk
domains such as biomedicine, law, and education. Existing evaluation methods
for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning
chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this,
we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets,
multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We
construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop
MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact
importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form
texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain
higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content. Our
work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual
reliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in
sensitive domains.

Motivation: 教育中需要客观可扩展的教学质量测量方法，通用大语言模型在处理复杂课堂观察工具时可靠性不足，需要更适合长文本分析的架构。

Method: 使用基于句子级嵌入的定制LLM架构，系统评估五种不同句子嵌入，采用数据高效训练机制防止过拟合，分析标注上下文窗口。

Result: 专业模型能达到人类水平表现（与专家评分相关性>0.65），超过平均人-人评分相关性；更先进的模型将更多分数变异归因于课程级特征而非孤立话语；聚合模型分数与教师增值指标相关。

Conclusion: 建立了AI驱动教学测量的可行方法，为提供可扩展、可靠、有效的教育者发展反馈开辟了路径，但模型尚未实现完全泛化。

Abstract: Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent
challenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,
general-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic
classroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on
sentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,
interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword
tokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings
under a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our
results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and
even super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and
surpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis
of annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better
aligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to
lesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the
sufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external
validity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added
measures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.
However, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that
while the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full
generalization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for
AI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable,
reliable, and valid feedback for educator development.

Motivation: 研究不同架构的大语言模型在上下文学习任务中的内部机制差异，探索不同知识类型任务中模型的工作方式。

Method: 使用行为探测和干预方法，评估transformer、状态空间和混合LLM在两类基于知识的上下文学习任务上的表现。

Result: 发现不同架构LLM在任务性能上表现相似但内部机制不同；函数向量主要位于自注意力和Mamba层；Mamba2可能使用不同于函数向量的机制进行上下文学习；函数向量在参数知识检索任务中更重要，在上下文知识理解中作用较小。

Conclusion: 不同架构和任务类型需要更细致的理解，同时强调结合行为和机制分析来研究LLM能力的重要性。

Abstract: We perform in-depth evaluations of in-context learning (ICL) on
state-of-the-art transformer, state-space, and hybrid large language models
over two categories of knowledge-based ICL tasks. Using a combination of
behavioral probing and intervention-based methods, we have discovered that,
while LLMs of different architectures can behave similarly in task performance,
their internals could remain different. We discover that function vectors (FVs)
responsible for ICL are primarily located in the self-attention and Mamba
layers, and speculate that Mamba2 uses a different mechanism from FVs to
perform ICL. FVs are more important for ICL involving parametric knowledge
retrieval, but not for contextual knowledge understanding. Our work contributes
to a more nuanced understanding across architectures and task types.
Methodologically, our approach also highlights the importance of combining both
behavioural and mechanistic analyses to investigate LLM capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估器仅依赖文本推理，无法验证复杂约束或进行精确计算，限制了评估能力。受工具集成推理在其他任务中成功的启发，希望开发能利用外部工具的评估器。

Method: 基于三个原则构建：跨可验证和不可验证领域的多样化训练、灵活的评估格式（点对点、成对、列表）、无需蒸馏的迭代强化学习。集成代码执行器进行精确评估。

Result: 在7个公共基准测试中，TIR-Judge比强推理基线的评估器性能提升高达6.4%（点对点）和7.7%（成对），80亿参数的模型在列表评估上达到与Claude-Opus-4相当的水平。

Conclusion: 工具增强的评估器可以通过迭代强化学习自我进化，无需蒸馏的TIR-Judge-Zero变体与蒸馏变体性能相当，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as judges to evaluate response
quality, providing a scalable alternative to human evaluation. However, most
LLM judges operate solely on intrinsic text-based reasoning, limiting their
ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation.
Motivated by the success of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in numerous tasks,
we propose TIR-Judge, an end-to-end RL framework for training LLM judges that
integrates a code executor for precise evaluation. TIR-Judge is built on three
principles: (i) diverse training across verifiable and non-verifiable domains,
(ii) flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and (iii)
iterative RL that bootstraps directly from the initial model without
distillation. On seven public benchmarks, TIR-Judge surpasses strong
reasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), and
achieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 despite having only
8B parameters. Remarkably, TIR-Judge-Zero - trained entirely without distilled
judge trajectories, matches the performance of distilled variants,
demonstrating that tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative
reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Knocking-Heads Attention (KHA)机制，通过共享对角初始化投影矩阵实现多头注意力之间的特征级交互，解决传统多头注意力机制中头间缺乏强交互的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多头注意力机制(MHA)及其变体(GQA、GTA)只是简单拼接各头的输出，缺乏头间的强交互，增加头数会削弱单个头的能力。

Method: 在缩放点积注意力之前应用共享对角初始化投影矩阵，使注意力头能够相互"敲击"，实现跨头特征级交互，同时保持头特异性。

Result: 在6.1B参数MoE模型上验证，KHA带来更优越和稳定的训练动态，在下游任务中表现更好，仅增加少量参数和FLOPs。

Conclusion: KHA是一种有效的多头注意力改进机制，能够无缝集成到各种注意力变体中，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-head attention (MHA) has become the cornerstone of modern large
language models, enhancing representational capacity through parallel attention
heads. However, increasing the number of heads inherently weakens individual
head capacity, and existing attention mechanisms - whether standard MHA or its
variants like grouped-query attention (GQA) and grouped-tied attention (GTA) -
simply concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction. To
address this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which
enables attention heads to "knock" on each other - facilitating cross-head
feature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention. This is
achieved by applying a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix across
all heads. The diagonal initialization preserves head-specific specialization
at the start of training while allowing the model to progressively learn
integrated cross-head representations. KHA adds only minimal parameters and
FLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention
variants. We validate KHA by training a 6.1B parameter MoE model (1.01B
activated) on 1T high-quality tokens. Compared to baseline attention
mechanisms, KHA brings superior and more stable training dynamics, achieving
better performance across downstream tasks.

TL;DR: QTT-RAG通过在mRAG中引入质量感知翻译标记，评估翻译质量并作为元数据附加，解决了低资源语言中翻译质量差导致生成性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的mRAG方法在低资源语言环境中检索英文文档并翻译时，翻译质量差会降低响应生成性能，而改写方法又会导致事实扭曲和幻觉。

Method: 提出QTT-RAG方法，从语义等价性、语法准确性和自然流畅性三个维度显式评估翻译质量，并将评分作为元数据附加而不改变原始内容。

Result: 在两个开放域QA基准测试中，使用6个2.4B到14B参数的指令调优LLM，覆盖韩语、芬兰语和中文，QTT-RAG优于CrossRAG和DKM-RAG基线方法。

Conclusion: QTT-RAG通过保持事实完整性并让生成模型基于翻译可靠性做出明智决策，为低资源环境中的跨语言文档使用提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) often retrieves English
documents and translates them into the query language for low-resource
settings. However, poor translation quality degrades response generation
performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality
or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and
hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware
Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation
quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and
naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the
original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines
in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs
ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages
(Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG
outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling
generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability.
This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in
low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a
practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have highlighted the significant
benefits of multi-stage training, with a particular emphasis on the emergence
of mid-training as a vital stage that bridges pre-training and post-training.
Mid-training is distinguished by its use of intermediate data and computational
resources, systematically enhancing specified capabilities such as mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and long-context extension, while maintaining foundational
competencies. This survey provides a formal definition of mid-training for
large language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that
encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture
optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of
objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a
distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities.
By clarifying the unique contributions of mid-training, this survey offers a
comprehensive taxonomy and actionable insights, supporting future research and
innovation in the advancement of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了MAP4TS框架，通过多角度提示设计将经典时间序列分析融入LLM预测，显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法忽视了时间序列数据的统计特性和时间依赖性，需要更好地结合经典时间序列分析方法

Method: 设计了四个专门提示组件：全局域提示、局部域提示、统计提示和时间提示，结合自相关、偏自相关和傅里叶分析，通过跨模态对齐模块生成统一表示

Result: 在8个不同数据集上的实验显示MAP4TS持续优于最先进的LLM方法，GPT-2骨干网络在结构化提示下优于LLaMA等更大模型

Conclusion: 提示感知设计显著增强性能稳定性，结构化提示与较小模型结合可在长期预测任务中取得更好效果

Abstract: Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models
(LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM
embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the
distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental
to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel
Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical
time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four
specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys
dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and
series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that
embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial
autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined
with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment
module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM
and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse
datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs
significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when
paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in
long-term forecasting tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究在医学多文档摘要中引入层次结构是否能改善信息组织和上下文理解，相比传统平面摘要方法。通过三种大语言模型和两种层次组织方式，发现层次方法能保持事实性、覆盖率和连贯性，同时提高人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学多文档摘要是复杂任务，需要有效管理跨文档关系。研究是否通过层次结构输入能提升模型组织和上下文理解信息的能力。

Method: 使用三种大语言模型，研究两种层次组织方式，通过自动指标、基于模型的指标和领域专家评估（偏好、可理解性、清晰度、复杂性、相关性、覆盖率、事实性、连贯性）进行综合评估。

Result: 人类专家更偏好模型生成的摘要而非人工编写的摘要。层次方法通常能保持信息的事实性、覆盖率和连贯性，同时增加人类对摘要的偏好。GPT-4模拟判断与人类判断在更客观评估维度上具有更高一致性。

Conclusion: 层次结构可以改善模型生成的医学摘要的清晰度，同时保持内容覆盖率，为提高生成摘要的人类偏好提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires
effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates
whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve
a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents
compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of
incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models
(LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using
automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of
preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage,
factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer
model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches
generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while
also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine
whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding
higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings
demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical
summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a
practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.

TL;DR: 提出了一种紧凑的单模型多语言词形变化方法，在73种语言上联合训练，性能优于单语言基线，简化了部署过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决缺乏开源、通用、多语言形态变化系统的问题，特别是能够处理未见词汇，包括捷克语等广泛语言

Method: 使用单模型在73种语言数据上联合训练，引入基于频率加权、词干不相交的训练-开发-测试重采样程序

Result: 模型轻量、对未见词汇鲁棒，在大多数语言中优于单语言基线，在SIGMORPHON基准和73个UD树库上表现良好

Conclusion: 证明了多语言建模在词形变化任务中的有效性，具有实际部署优势，所有代码已开源

Abstract: We present a compact, single-model approach to multilingual inflection, the
task of generating inflected word forms from base lemmas to express grammatical
categories. Our model, trained jointly on data from 73 languages, is
lightweight, robust to unseen words, and outperforms monolingual baselines in
most languages. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multilingual modeling
for inflection and highlights its practical benefits: simplifying deployment by
eliminating the need to manage and retrain dozens of separate monolingual
models. In addition to the standard SIGMORPHON shared task benchmarks, we
evaluate our monolingual and multilingual models on 73 Universal Dependencies
(UD) treebanks, extracting lemma-tag-form triples and their frequency counts.
To ensure realistic data splits, we introduce a novel frequency-weighted,
lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure. Our work addresses the lack
of an open-source, general-purpose, multilingual morphological inflection
system capable of handling unseen words across a wide range of languages,
including Czech. All code is publicly released at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TopLoRA方法，通过动态调整LoRA权重来学习token级别的输入-输出投影，解决了标准LoRA无法捕捉token特定信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA中所有输入token共享相同的权重和输入-输出投影，限制了其捕捉token特定信息的能力，因为不同token之间存在固有的语义差异。

Method: TopLoRA通过动态调整LoRA权重，学习token级别的输入-输出投影。权重表示为BΣ_XA，其中A和B是低秩矩阵，Σ_X是从每个输入token X生成的对角矩阵。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，TopLoRA始终优于LoRA及其变体。

Conclusion: TopLoRA在不增加LoRA权重秩的情况下，通过学习token级别的LoRA权重实现了更细粒度的适应。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the
projection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the
dimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens
share the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This
limits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent
semantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose
Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts
LoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise
input-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of
TopLoRA can be expressed as $B\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank
matrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated
from each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA
weights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA
weights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments
across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探索了在形态学屈折任务中引入语料库频率信息的方法，包括频率加权的训练-开发-测试集划分、结合类型准确率和词例准确率的评估方法，以及频率感知训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统形态学屈折方法忽略了词汇频率分布信息，而实际应用中用户输入反映了自然文本的真实频率分布。为了更好的部署效果，需要将频率信息融入系统开发过程。

Method: 1）采用词干不相交且频率加重的训练-开发-测试集划分；2）结合类型准确率和词例准确率进行评估；3）引入频率感知训练方法，在训练过程中明确考虑词频。

Result: 频率感知训练在43种语言中的26种语言上表现优于均匀采样方法。

Conclusion: 将语料库频率信息融入形态学屈折任务的系统开发过程能够提升模型在实际部署中的性能表现。

Abstract: The traditional approach to morphological inflection (the task of modifying a
base word (lemma) to express grammatical categories) has been, for decades, to
consider lexical entries of lemma-tag-form triples uniformly, lacking any
information about their frequency distribution. However, in production
deployment, one might expect the user inputs to reflect a real-world
distribution of frequencies in natural texts. With future deployment in mind,
we explore the incorporation of corpus frequency information into the task of
morphological inflection along three key dimensions during system development:
(i) for train-dev-test split, we combine a lemma-disjoint approach, which
evaluates the model's generalization capabilities, with a frequency-weighted
strategy to better reflect the realistic distribution of items across different
frequency bands in training and test sets; (ii) for evaluation, we complement
the standard type accuracy (often referred to simply as accuracy), which treats
all items equally regardless of frequency, with token accuracy, which assigns
greater weight to frequent words and better approximates performance on running
text; (iii) for training data sampling, we introduce a method novel in the
context of inflection, frequency-aware training, which explicitly incorporates
word frequency into the sampling process. We show that frequency-aware training
outperforms uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ENTP框架通过神经符号方法从低质量数据中提取价值，通过净化与重建增强SFT数据集，仅使用低质量数据就能超越传统数据选择方法和完整数据集的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT方法主要依赖高质量数据，忽视了低质量数据中的有价值信号，且依赖不完美的质量过滤器。

Method: 提出ENTP框架，结合符号模块（基于统计先验识别和修剪噪声样本）和神经模块（利用潜在表示和模型知识合成增强的指令-响应对）。

Result: 仅使用低质量数据构建的ENTP增强数据集在五个指令遵循基准测试中超越了13个现有数据选择基线，甚至优于在完整原始数据集（约30万样本）上的微调。

Conclusion: 低质量数据具有未开发的潜力，智能净化和合成对于高效的指令对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of
high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset
that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing
quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded
low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP
(Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a
framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification
and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy
samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes
enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and
model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and
diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed
exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection
baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass
fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our
results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the
importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction
alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出双阶段精炼框架(DSR)，将剧本创作分解为创意叙事生成和格式转换两个阶段，通过混合数据合成解决训练数据稀缺问题，显著提升LLM生成剧本的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端生成方法让单一模型同时掌握创意叙事构建和严格格式遵循两种不同能力，导致生成的剧本虽然表面风格相似但缺乏深层结构完整性和故事实质。

Method: DSR框架：第一阶段将简要大纲转换为丰富的小说风格散文，第二阶段将叙事精炼为专业格式剧本。采用混合数据合成：反向合成将现有剧本解构为结构化输入，前向合成利用这些输入生成高质量叙事文本作为训练目标。

Result: 专业编剧盲评显示，DSR对Gemini-2.5-Pro等强基线达到75%胜率，达到人类水平表现的82.7%。

Conclusion: 分解生成架构结合定制化数据合成能有效让LLM在复杂创意领域实现专业化。

Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining
narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end
generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue
this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two
disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format
adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep
structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.
To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage
Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative
generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline
into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a
professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to
specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in
implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We
address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs
existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages
these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.
Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%
win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of
human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation
architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in
complex creative domains.

TL;DR: MATCH是一个新的无参考代码评估指标，使用对比学习生成代码和自然语言任务描述的嵌入，通过相似性评分评估生成代码与开发者意图的匹配程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代码生成日益普及，但准确评估生成代码与开发者意图的匹配程度仍然困难。传统方法如单元测试扩展性差，语法相似度指标无法捕捉代码功能，而CodeBERTScore等需要参考代码。

Method: 使用对比学习生成代码和自然语言任务描述的有意义嵌入，通过相似性评分来反映生成代码实现任务的程度。

Result: MATCH在多种编程语言中，与功能正确性和人类偏好的相关性比现有指标更强。

Conclusion: MATCH提供了一个有效的无参考代码评估方法，能更好地评估生成代码与开发者意图的匹配程度。

Abstract: AI-based code generation is increasingly prevalent, with GitHub Copilot
estimated to generate 46% of the code on GitHub. Accurately evaluating how well
generated code aligns with developer intent remains a critical challenge.
Traditional evaluation methods, such as unit tests, are often unscalable and
costly. Syntactic similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) fail to capture code
functionality, and metrics like CodeBERTScore require reference code, which is
not always available. To address the gap in reference-free evaluation, with few
alternatives such as ICE-Score, this paper introduces MATCH, a novel
reference-free metric. MATCH uses Contrastive Learning to generate meaningful
embeddings for code and natural language task descriptions, enabling similarity
scoring that reflects how well generated code implements the task. We show that
MATCH achieves stronger correlations with functional correctness and human
preference than existing metrics across multiple programming languages.

TL;DR: SI-Bench是一个评估大语言模型社交智能的新基准，包含2,221个真实多轮对话，实验显示SOTA模型在复杂社交情境的过程推理上超越人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展出拟人能力并被部署为自主代理与人类互动，评估其在真实复杂社交互动中的表现成为重要挑战。现有研究多通过模拟代理间交互构建数据集，无法捕捉真实人类对话的语言风格和关系动态。

Method: 基于广泛的社会科学理论，从社交网络应用收集2,221个真实多轮对话构建SI-Bench基准，并对312个对话在8个主要模型上进行人工标注。

Result: 实验表明，SOTA模型在复杂社交情境的过程推理上超越了人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类。引入思维链推理可能会降低LLMs在社交对话任务中的表现。

Conclusion: SI-Bench为评估LLMs的社交智能提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在社交推理和回复质量方面的差距，所有数据集已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are
increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans.
However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social
interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built
datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture
the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad
social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues
collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of
312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show
that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under
complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality.
Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the
performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available
at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.

Motivation: 药物关系提取对识别药物相互作用和预测副作用至关重要，但目前缺乏专门的数据集，需要采用迁移学习

Method: 先使用训练好的关系提取模型发现实体间关系，然后应用于医学文本语料库构建药物关系本体，最后用大语言模型验证提取的关系

Result: 定量结果显示LLM同意71%从PubMed摘要子集中提取的关系，定性分析表明该方法能揭示医学领域的模糊性

Conclusion: 该方法能有效构建药物关系本体，同时揭示了医学领域关系提取面临的挑战

Abstract: Relation extraction between drugs plays a crucial role in identifying drug
drug interactions and predicting side effects. The advancement of machine
learning methods in relation extraction, along with the development of large
medical text databases, has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations
compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However,
to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed
for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing
transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this
domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained
relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then
applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of
drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a
large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71
of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our
qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in
the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction
in this field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种句子级别的过程奖励模型（PRM），用于检测大型视觉语言模型生成的放射学报告中的临床幻觉，该模型在未见过的LVLM上表现出强泛化能力，并能有效提升报告质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在生成放射学报告时会产生临床关键性幻觉，带来严重风险，而现有的幻觉检测方法缺乏句子级别的细粒度分析能力，且在不同LVLM生成器间的泛化能力不足。

Method: 开发了一个轻量级的句子级别过程奖励模型（PRM），基于临床上下文和先前文本预测生成句子的真实性，在MIMIC-CXR数据集上使用弱监督标签进行微调。

Result: 0.5B参数的PRM在多个指标上优于现有验证技术，在未见过的LVLM上表现出强泛化能力，能有效过滤低质量报告并提升临床指标。

Conclusion: 轻量级、上下文感知的PRM为临床LVLM提供了一个模型无关的安全层，无需访问内部激活状态即可有效检测和减少幻觉。

Abstract: Automating radiology report generation with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) holds great potential, yet these models often produce clinically
critical hallucinations, posing serious risks. Existing hallucination detection
methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust
generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach:
a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language
task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,
conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on
MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM
outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance,
relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in
AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods
reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to
an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively
filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when
discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted
best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative
improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for
BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM
provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to
internal activations

Motivation: 传统语音识别研究依赖标准形式，而方言ASR被视为微调任务，需要研究方言变异对ASR的影响。

Method: 开发Ben-10语料库，从语言学和数据驱动角度分析，比较零样本和微调设置下语音基础模型的表现。

Result: 所有深度学习方法在方言变异下都表现困难，但方言特定模型训练能改善性能；该数据集可作为资源受限ASR算法的OOD资源。

Conclusion: 方言变异对ASR构成重大挑战，需要专门的方法来处理；Ben-10数据集为低资源方言ASR研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Conventional research on speech recognition modeling relies on the canonical
form for most low-resource languages while automatic speech recognition (ASR)
for regional dialects is treated as a fine-tuning task. To investigate the
effects of dialectal variations on ASR we develop a 78-hour annotated Bengali
Speech-to-Text (STT) corpus named Ben-10. Investigation from linguistic and
data-driven perspectives shows that speech foundation models struggle heavily
in regional dialect ASR, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We observe
that all deep learning methods struggle to model speech data under dialectal
variations but dialect specific model training alleviates the issue. Our
dataset also serves as a out of-distribution (OOD) resource for ASR modeling
under constrained resources in ASR algorithms. The dataset and code developed

TL;DR: Mubeen是一个专有的阿拉伯语语言模型，专注于阿拉伯语言学、伊斯兰研究和文化遗产的深度理解，通过原生阿拉伯语源确保文化真实性和准确性，采用实用闭合架构解决用户需求与答案之间的效用差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有阿拉伯语模型依赖英语翻译数据导致意图检测和检索增强生成失败的问题，以及事实正确答案无法解决用户核心需求的"效用差距危机"。

Method: 基于大量真实阿拉伯语源训练，包括历史手稿数字化、学术著作、学术论文等，采用深度语言工程框架和实用闭合架构，结合文化遗产专业化和多学科专家模块。

Result: 模型能够精确理解古典文本、当代写作和地区方言，掌握阿拉伯语的优雅表达，提供准确且上下文相关的响应，从信息存储库转变为决定性指导工具。

Conclusion: Mubeen通过原生阿拉伯语源和实用闭合架构，有效解决了阿拉伯语言模型的文化真实性和用户效用问题，支持沙特2030愿景，在文化遗产保护和通用知识领域均表现稳健。

Abstract: Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA,
optimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and
cultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic
sources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a
proprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works
in linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside
thousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned
through a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the
meaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across
classical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on
comprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant
responses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that
often fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen
uses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its
core innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the
"Utility Gap Crisis" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users'

*Bang Xiao,Lingjie Jiang,Shaohan Huang,Tengchao Lv,Yupan Huang,Xun Wu,Lei Cui,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种提升LLM生成代码美观度的新方法，包括构建AesCode-358K数据集、多智能体奖励反馈系统GRPO-AR算法，以及OpenDesign评估基准。实验表明该方法显著提升了代码美观度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在传统编程任务中表现出色，但在视觉导向的编码任务中生成代码的美观度较差，需要专门的方法来提升代码美学质量。

Method: 构建AesCode-358K指令调优数据集；提出多智能体奖励反馈系统评估可执行性、静态美学和交互美学；开发GRPO-AR算法联合优化功能性和代码美观度；创建OpenDesign评估基准。

Result: 在AesCode-358K上进行监督微调并结合强化学习的多智能体奖励反馈，显著提升了OpenDesign基准上的性能，并在PandasPlotBench等现有基准上也有改进。AesCoder-4B超越了GPT-4o和GPT-4.1，性能与480B-685B参数的大型开源模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM生成代码的美观度，证明了结合监督微调和强化学习在代码美学优化中的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers
in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such
as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding
tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new
pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first
construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on
code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system
that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics.
Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the
GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics.
Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics.
Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K
with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly
improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing
benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o
and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models
with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 第九届CHiME挑战赛引入多模态上下文感知识别任务，解决单房间环境下重叠对话的鸡尾酒会问题，通过音频、视觉和上下文线索识别谁在何时说什么以及与谁对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实多参与者对话中的极端语音重叠问题，这些对话包含高达100%的重叠率和高度碎片化的对话轮次，传统音频方法无法有效处理。

Method: 使用音频、视觉和上下文线索联合转录每个说话者的语音，并将其聚类到各自的对话中。数据收集聚焦于无脚本的随意群组聊天。

Result: 纯音频基线的词错误率超过100%，而加入视觉线索后性能提升50%，突显多模态方法的重要性。

Conclusion: 多模态方法对于处理极端语音重叠的对话识别任务至关重要，视觉线索能显著提升系统性能。

Abstract: We introduce the task of Multi-Modal Context-Aware Recognition (MCoRec) in
the ninth CHiME Challenge, which addresses the cocktail-party problem of
overlapping conversations in a single-room setting using audio, visual, and
contextual cues. MCoRec captures natural multi-party conversations where the
recordings focus on unscripted, casual group chats, leading to extreme speech
overlap of up to 100% and highly fragmented conversational turns. The task
requires systems to answer the question "Who speaks when, what, and with whom?"
by jointly transcribing each speaker's speech and clustering them into their
respective conversations from audio-visual recordings. Audio-only baselines
exceed 100% word error rate, whereas incorporating visual cues yields
substantial 50% improvements, highlighting the importance of multi-modality. In
this manuscript, we present the motivation behind the task, outline the data
collection process, and report the baseline systems developed for the MCoRec.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种完全自动化的数据为中心的方法来改进文本到SQL任务，包括自适应数据修复和错误数据增强，以及多模型协作训练和集成策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于代理的框架在文本到SQL任务中取得了显著改进，但数据为中心策略的影响很少被探索。单个微调模型的能力非常有限，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 设计了完全自动化的数据为中心流程：自适应数据修复自动发现和修复训练数据集中的错误；错误数据增强扩散和增强初始训练模型预测的错误数据；多模型协作训练使用不同的增强数据训练多个模型；集成策略整合多个模型的能力。

Result: 实验结果表明数据为中心流程和多模型交互迭代策略的有效性，在轻量级文本到SQL模型（70B以内）中取得了第一名。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的方法和多模型协作策略显著提升了文本到SQL任务的性能，证明了数据质量和模型多样性对任务成功的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL tasks have gained attractive improvements since the release of
ChatGPT. Among them, agent-based frameworks have been widely used in this
field. However, the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks has
rarely been explored. In this paper, we systemically design a fully automated
data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, including \emph{adaptive data
repair}, which can automatically find and fix errors in the training dataset;
and \emph{error data augmentation}, where we specifically diffuse and enhance
erroneous data predicted by the initially trained models. Meanwhile, we propose
a Multi-Model collaboration training schema, aiming to train multiple models
with different augmented data, enabling them to possess distinct capabilities
and work together to complement each other, because it has been found that the
capability of a single fine-tuned model is very limited. Furthermore, we
utilize an ensemble strategy to integrate the capabilities of multiple models
to solve a multiple-choice question, aiming to further improve the accuracy of
text-to-SQL tasks. The experiment results and ablation study have demonstrated
the effectiveness of data-centric pipeline and Multi-Model(MM) interactive
iterative strategies, achieving first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models
(within 70B).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Arabic Little STT数据集，包含288名6-13岁儿童的355条黎凡特阿拉伯语语音，并评估了Whisper模型在儿童语音识别上的表现，发现其词错误率高达0.66，远高于成人语音的0.20以下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语等低资源语言中儿童特定语音语料库缺失的问题，填补儿童语音识别领域的空白。

Method: 创建Arabic Little STT儿童语音数据集，并系统评估8个Whisper变体模型在该数据集上的表现，与成人阿拉伯语基准进行比较。

Result: 即使性能最好的Whisper Large_v3模型在儿童语音上的词错误率也高达0.66，远高于其在成人数据集上低于0.20的表现。

Conclusion: 强调在ASR开发中需要专门的儿童语音基准测试和包容性训练数据，且此类数据必须遵循严格的伦理和隐私框架来保护儿童敏感信息。

Abstract: The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems fundamentally depends
on high-quality training data. However, low-resource languages like Arabic
suffer from severe data scarcity. Moreover, the absence of child-specific
speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges. To
address this gap, we present our created dataset, Arabic Little STT, a dataset
of Levantine Arabic child speech recorded in classrooms, containing 355
utterances from 288 children (ages 6 - 13). We further conduct a systematic
assessment of Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR)
model, on this dataset and compare its performance with adult Arabic
benchmarks. Our evaluation across eight Whisper variants reveals that even the
best-performing model (Large_v3) struggles significantly, achieving a 0.66 word
error rate (WER) on child speech, starkly contrasting with its sub 0.20 WER on
adult datasets. These results align with other research on English speech.
Results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and
inclusive training data in ASR development. Emphasizing that such data must be
governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child
information. We hope that this study provides an initial step for future work
on equitable speech technologies for Arabic-speaking children. We hope that our
publicly available dataset enrich the children's demographic representation in
ASR datasets.

TL;DR: AdaSearch是一种新颖的块状搜索策略，通过自适应分配固定计算预算，专注于关键初始token，在LLM对齐任务中优于Best-of-N和微调基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM对齐仍是一个关键挑战。推理时方法提供了微调的灵活替代方案，但其统一计算努力通常产生次优对齐。假设在许多对齐任务中，响应的初始token更为关键。

Method: 引入AdaSearch，一种新颖的块状搜索策略。它使用采样计划自适应分配固定计算预算，将搜索努力集中在这些关键token上。应用于顺序解码并引入其树搜索对应物AdaBeam。

Result: 在八个LLM上的综合评估显示，AdaSearch优于强大的Best-of-N和微调基线。特别是，在无害生成、受控情感生成和数学推理任务中，相对于Best-of-N的胜率提高了10%以上。

Conclusion: AdaSearch通过专注于关键初始token的自适应计算分配，在LLM对齐任务中实现了显著改进。

Abstract: LLM alignment remains a critical challenge. Inference-time methods provide a
flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort
often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment
tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical.
To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search
strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling
schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch
to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our
comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch
outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates
improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment
generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于八字命理的人格推理问答数据集和BaZi-LLM系统，将符号推理与大语言模型结合，生成时间动态和细粒度的虚拟人格，相比主流LLM在准确性上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虚拟角色生成方法依赖标注数据或手工制作的人格提示，难以扩展且难以生成真实、上下文一致的人格。

Method: 创建八字命理人格推理问答数据集，将人类经验分类为财富、健康、亲属、职业和关系等生活事件问答；提出BaZi-LLM系统，将符号推理与大语言模型集成。

Result: 相比DeepSeek-v3和GPT-5-mini等主流LLM，准确率提升30.3%-62.6%；当使用错误的八字信息时，模型准确率下降20%-45%。

Conclusion: 基于文化基础的符号-LLM集成在实现真实角色模拟方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and
virtual reality, yet current methods rely heavily on annotated data or
handcrafted persona prompts, making it difficult to scale up and generate
realistic, contextually coherent personas. We create the first QA dataset for
BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into
wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as
life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM
system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to
generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with
mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a
30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information
is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of
culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character
simulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量知识图谱的稀缺性限制了AI应用发展，现有提取方法依赖错误率高的模式匹配或资源密集型大语言模型，计算需求限制了在低资源环境中的可访问性。

Method: 提出LightKGG框架：1) 上下文集成图提取，将上下文信息与节点和边集成到统一图结构中；2) 拓扑增强关系推理，利用提取图的固有拓扑结构高效推断关系。

Result: 能够在最小硬件需求下实现准确的知识图谱构建，弥合了自动知识提取与实际部署场景之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该工作通过科学严谨的方法优化了小型语言模型在结构化NLP任务中的效率，为低资源环境下的知识图谱提取提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical
bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely
heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large
language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their
computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our
paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG
extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through
two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction
integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph
structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while
maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference
leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer
relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex
language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG
construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap
between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while
introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in
structured NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能正在重塑劳动力市场，但缺乏系统预测AI对就业影响的工具。现有研究表明LLMs能够提取情感、总结经济报告和模拟预测者行为，但很少评估其在前瞻性劳动力预测中的应用。

Method: 构建了一个结合美国部门级高频职位发布指数和全球AI采用职业变化预测数据的基准，使用时间分割避免信息泄露，评估了任务支架、角色驱动和混合提示策略在不同模型家族中的表现。

Result: 结构化任务提示持续提高预测稳定性，角色提示在短期趋势上有优势，但性能在不同部门和预测时间跨度上差异显著，表明需要领域感知提示和严格评估协议。

Conclusion: 该工作为劳动力预测、提示设计和基于LLM的经济推理研究提供了可复现的测试平台，有助于理解LLMs与现实经济数据交互的局限性和机会。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to
systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a
benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate
changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing
research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,
and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for
forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary
datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United
States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI
adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal
splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using
multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and
hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy
and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task
prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer
advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly
across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting
and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to
support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based
economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how
LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible
testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool
in the context of labor markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宗教语言在环境行动主义和气候变化辩论等世俗领域中仍然普遍存在，需要研究如何有效检测和分析这些宗教语言。

Method: 采用双重方法：基于生态神学文献构建的宗教术语层次树的规则模型，以及在零样本设置下运行的大型语言模型，分析超过88万句文本。

Result: 基于规则的方法比大型语言模型更一致地将更多句子标记为宗教语言。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了宗教语言检测的方法论挑战，以及宗教语言是否应仅由词汇定义还是应考虑上下文意义的广泛张力，展示了数字方法在宗教研究中的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in
ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change
debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious
language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological
approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms
derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating
in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we
compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of
agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method
consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings
highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting
religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language
should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study
contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the
potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred
persists in climate discourse.

Motivation: 针对时间序列预测领域Transformer模型有效性的争议，以及数据对近期历史更敏感且易受不可预测事件影响的特点，需要开发更鲁棒和有效的预测框架。

Method: 采用混合专家(MoE)框架，集成xLSTM、增强线性模型、PatchTST、minGRU等多种互补的SOTA模型，使用基于Transformer的门控网络进行模型选择和集成。

Result: 在标准时间序列预测基准测试中，提出的MoE框架模型超越了所有现有方法，包括最新的基于MoE的方法。

Conclusion: 通过集成多种互补的时间序列预测模型，MoE框架能够有效利用各模型的优势，在时间序列预测任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The immense success of the Transformer architecture
  in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries
Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown.
  However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by
  demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms
  Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid,
  by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM
demonstrated even better results by repurposing a
  Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow
  up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM
  component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields
  better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact
  that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject
  to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we
  propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method
  combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced
Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of
  complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former
based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms
  all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the
  latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.

Conclusion: Omni-Reward是迈向通用多模态奖励建模的重要一步，支持自由形式偏好，覆盖文本、图像、视频、音频和3D五种模态。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human
preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance,
where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering
limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference
Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the
complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above
challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward
modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:
We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form
preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,
video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal
preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K
instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We
propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative
RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other
widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单轮场景下的置信度，而在复杂多轮交互中的置信度研究有限。论文旨在探索LLM搜索代理在长序列动作后通过语言化置信度分数传达自身置信度的能力。

Method: 在开源代理模型上进行实验，提出测试时缩放(TTS)方法，利用置信度分数确定答案质量，鼓励模型在达到满意置信度水平前重试。

Result: 实验发现模型在高置信度时任务准确率显著更高，低置信度时准确率接近零。提出的TTS方法显著减少了token消耗，同时与基线固定预算TTS方法相比表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: LLM搜索代理能够通过语言化置信度分数有效传达不确定性，基于置信度的测试时缩放方法在减少计算成本的同时保持了性能竞争力。

Abstract: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer
reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while
research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this
paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to
communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after
long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to
outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source
agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at
high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based
on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use
confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again
until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed
methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive
performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEC文件和财报电话会议记录对投资者、审计师和监管者很重要，但其长度、金融术语和微妙语言使细粒度分析困难，且传统方法需要大量昂贵标注数据。

Method: 从10-K年报和财报电话会议记录中提取句子，使用ChatGPT-o3-pro模型进行立场标注并经过严格人工验证，系统评估现代大语言模型的零样本、少样本和Chain-of-Thought提示策略。

Result: few-shot配合Chain-of-Thought提示策略表现最佳，优于监督基线，且大语言模型在SEC和财报电话会议数据集上的性能存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在不依赖大量标注数据的情况下，利用大语言模型进行金融领域目标特定立场检测的实践可行性。

Abstract: Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very
important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length,
financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult.
Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive
labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial
targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for
stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per
share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual
reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using
the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this
corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models
(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best
compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC
and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging
LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring
extensive labeled data.

Conclusion: MMTutorBench揭示了AI数学辅导的难度和诊断价值，为推进AI辅导系统发展提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also
diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks
largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first
benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around
pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with
problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six
dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation
Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find
clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial
room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR
pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains,
and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results
highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for
advancing AI tutoring.

TL;DR: M4FC是一个新的多模态事实核查数据集，包含4,982张图像和6,980个声明，涵盖10种语言和6个多模态事实核查任务，解决了现有数据集的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实世界多模态事实核查数据集存在样本少、语言单一、证据泄露、依赖外部新闻源等问题，需要构建更全面的数据集。

Method: 收集了22个专业事实核查组织验证的图像，涵盖多样文化和地理背景，声明支持10种语言，定义了6个多模态事实核查任务。

Result: 构建了包含4,982张图像和6,980个声明的数据集，为所有任务提供了基线结果，并分析了中间任务组合对下游裁决预测的影响。

Conclusion: M4FC数据集解决了现有数据集的局限性，为多模态事实核查研究提供了更全面的资源，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Existing real-world datasets for multimodal automated fact-checking have
multiple limitations: they contain few instances, focus on only one or two
languages and tasks, suffer from evidence leakage, or depend on external sets
of news articles for sourcing true claims. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce M4FC, a new real-world dataset comprising 4,982 images paired with
6,980 claims. The images, verified by professional fact-checkers from 22
organizations, represent diverse cultural and geographic contexts. Each claim
is available in one or two out of ten languages. M4FC spans six multimodal
fact-checking tasks: visual claim extraction, claimant intent prediction, fake
detection, image contextualization, location verification, and verdict
prediction. We provide baseline results for all tasks and analyze how combining
intermediate tasks influence downstream verdict prediction performance. We make
our dataset and code available.

*Jieyong Kim,Maryam Amirizaniani,Soojin Yoon,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了IPQA基准测试，用于评估个性化问答中的核心意图识别能力，发现现有模型在识别用户优先意图方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试只评估回答质量或检索性能，没有直接衡量意图识别能力，而理解用户优先意图对生成满足个性化信息需求的回答至关重要。

Method: 基于满意理论，从用户选择答案的可观察行为模式中推导核心意图，通过系统过滤、LLM标注和严格质量控制构建多领域数据集。

Result: 实验评估显示，当前最先进的语言模型在个性化情境下难以识别核心意图，随着问题复杂度增加，性能进一步下降。

Conclusion: 需要改进模型识别用户核心意图的能力，IPQA基准测试和数据集将公开以促进该方向的研究。

Abstract: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate
responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing
benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without
directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical
because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot
generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we
introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting
answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we
propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized
Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized
intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer
selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting
their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains
through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality
control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental
evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems
struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail
to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as
question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly
available to facilitate future research in this direction.

*Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Siyue Zhang,Chen Zhao,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIMRANK是一个使用少量高质量合成数据进行微调的LLM重排序模型，在推理密集型检索和指令跟随检索任务中表现优异，仅需传统方法5%的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖大规模微调来适应LLM进行信息重排序任务，计算成本高昂。

Method: 设计了LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER管道生成多样化、具有挑战性的合成重排序示例，使用这些数据微调LIMRANK模型。

Result: LIMRANK在BRIGHT和FollowIR基准测试中达到竞争性性能，且展现出强大的跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过最小化高质量监督，可以有效适应LLM进行重排序任务，显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs
for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this
work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only
minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design
LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating
diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic
data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two
challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and
FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that
LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5%
of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate
the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization
capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific
literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive
problem solving.

*Luis Ramos,Hiram Calvo,Olga Kolesnikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了传统机器学习模型和微调transformer在希望语音检测任务上的表现，发现transformer模型在精度和召回率方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别希望语音已成为重要的NLP任务，需要在社交媒体平台上检测具有动机性和目标导向行为的表达。

Method: 使用传统机器学习模型（SVM、逻辑回归、朴素贝叶斯）和微调的transformer模型，在预先分割的希望语音数据集上进行评估。

Result: 传统模型中线性核SVM和逻辑回归的宏F1为0.78，RBF核SVM为0.77，朴素贝叶斯为0.75。Transformer模型表现更好，最佳模型加权精度0.82，加权召回0.80，加权F1为0.79，宏F1为0.79，准确率0.80。

Conclusion: 虽然优化配置的传统机器学习模型仍然有效，但transformer架构能够检测希望语音中的细微语义，在小数据集上获得更高的精度和召回率，表明大型transformer和LLM在小型数据集上可能表现更好。

Abstract: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering
the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed
behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional
machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope
speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a
linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM
with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models
delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82,
weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80
accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional
machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some
subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech
detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in
small datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BR-RM模型，将"思考两次"原则应用于奖励建模，通过两轮评估减少判断扩散，提高对细微错误的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型将多个质量维度压缩为单一标量，导致注意力分散和判断扩散问题，无法进行深入分析。

Method: 采用两轮评估：第一轮自适应分支选择关键维度并生成假设，第二轮分支条件重思考进行针对性重读和假设验证。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的奖励建模基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BR-RM通过将一次性评分转换为聚焦的二次思考推理，减少了判断扩散，提高了对细微但重要错误的敏感性，同时保持实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that
externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with
think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit
stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many
quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces
judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding
diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a
two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1
performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical
dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,
evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a
targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters
most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn
traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making
the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting
all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,
BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet
consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code
and the model will be released soon.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合AI与计算心理学的多层面框架，通过端到端开发流程建立从预测建模到交互式心理分析的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用AI和计算心理学来建模、理解和交互复杂的人类心理状态，弥合孤立预测建模与交互式心理分析系统之间的差距。

Method: 采用端到端开发流程：1) 在四个心理学数据集上建立基础性能基准；2) 微调transformer模型并解决工程挑战；3) 使用参数高效技术微调生成式LLM作为交互式"人格大脑"；4) 将模型部署为可扩展的微服务生态系统。

Result: 成功稳定了基于transformer的情感计算回归模型，在标准方法失败的情况下显示出有意义的预测性能，并开发了可复现的大规模AI研究方法论。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了从研究到部署的完整管道，整合了预测分析与生成对话，为计算心理学和人机交互的未来研究提供了实用模型。

Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology
presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human
psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a
comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between
isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological
analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development
lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four
diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.
Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that
necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical
engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in
regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting
large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative
large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques
to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of
predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,
scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful
stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,
showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and
the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI
research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach,
demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates
predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical
model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PREFINE是一个无需参数更新或直接用户反馈的个性化故事生成框架，通过伪用户代理和用户特定评分标准实现个性化生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式反馈或微调，存在用户负担、数据收集、计算成本和隐私问题，需要更高效的个性化生成方法。

Method: 构建伪用户代理从用户交互历史中生成用户特定评分标准，让该代理基于这些定制标准对输出进行批判和优化。

Result: 在PerDOC和PerMPST数据集上的评估显示，PREFINE在自动评估中获得了更高的胜率和统计显著分数，且不损害一般故事质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在故事生成中有效，并有望在对话系统、教育和推荐等更广泛应用中实现高效个性化。

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the
quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing
personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional
approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical
issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and
privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided
Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine
paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a
user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation
criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's
behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized
generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.
We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the
contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations
(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically
significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story
quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user
agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization
performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling
efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems,
education, and recommendation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIGN（Schema-Induced Games for Naming）是一种命名游戏，通过轻量级结构引导多智能体系统形成一致的通信约定，相比无约束自然语言能实现5.8倍更快的收敛速度和更高的协议一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实AI系统处理复杂问题时，多个大语言模型智能体之间的不一致约定会导致协调失败，协作编码和分布式规划等应用需要可靠、一致的通信，且随着系统规模扩大，可扩展性成为核心问题。

Method: 引入SIGN命名游戏，研究轻量级结构如何引导约定形成，比较模式诱导通信与无约束自然语言的效果。

Result: 模式诱导通信比无约束自然语言收敛更快，协议一致性最高可达5.8倍。

Conclusion: 最小化结构可以作为多智能体协调的简单控制机制，实现高效协调，其应用范围可扩展到命名游戏之外的更广泛领域。

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

TL;DR: 研究发现解码器自回归语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在能力上限，参数规模扩大至1-2B后准确率提升极小，尽管损失函数持续下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究解码器自回归语言模型在知识密集型任务中的扩展能力限制，为资源分配决策提供依据。

Method: 系统评估OPT和Pythia模型家族(70M-30B参数)，进行注意力干预实验，比较不同任务类型的性能表现。

Result: 知识检索任务准确率几乎无提升，MMLU数学基准准确率稳定在19-20%，而算术等程序性任务表现正常扩展。注意力扰动导致性能灾难性崩溃。

Conclusion: 对于OPT和Pythia架构的知识密集型应用，参数扩展超过1-2B带来的准确率收益极小，这些模型家族存在特定能力扩展失败问题。

Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive
language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT
and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling)
reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement
despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains
flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy
loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show
conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention
intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping
attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse
(complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements
have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications
using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers
minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings
quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform
resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental
constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific
limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse
architectural approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了GeoThoughts数据集和GeoThought-MLLM模型，通过包含详细推理链的训练数据显著提升了多模态模型在几何推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在视觉推理特别是几何问题解决中性能显著下降的问题，主要挑战来自几何问题的内在复杂性（需要详细图像理解和多步推理）以及现有数据集在规模、多样性和显式推理轨迹方面的不足。

Method: 创建了包含6,243个样本的Geo-Thought-6K数据集和10,834个样本的Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K数据集，每个样本包含视觉描述、逐步解决方案、显式推理链、反思步骤和最终答案。基于此数据集开发了GeoThought-MLLM多模态数学推理模型。

Result: 模型在几何任务中超越了现有基准，证明使用Chain-of-Thought数据集训练可以提升模型在领域内和领域外的几何推理能力。

Conclusion: 错误主要源于数学概念的错误解释或空间判断错误，通过调用CoT机制可以纠正这些错误并产生正确答案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

Motivation: 探索生成模型在组合优化问题中的应用，利用学习策略解决传统算法难以处理的大规模问题，实现计算可扩展性。

Method: 使用轨迹平衡损失训练GFlowNets，顺序构建解决方案：为生成树选择边、为路径选择节点、为旅行选择城市。

Result: 在不同规模的基准实例上，GFlowNets学会了找到最优解，生成结果与Dijkstra、Kruskal等经典算法一致，训练收敛时间随问题复杂度增加。

Conclusion: 生成模型可以通过学习策略解决组合优化问题，主要优势是计算可扩展性，通过训练分摊计算成本，有望扩展到传统精确方法不可行的大规模问题。

Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph
optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning
Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample
solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the
Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for
spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark
instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions.
For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of
nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical
algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact
solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the
number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size
grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from
classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that
generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned
policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational
scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance,
GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational
resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances
where classical exact methods become infeasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在函数逼近自然出现的实用模型中，当价值函数在策略集$\Pi$上线性可实现时，学习最优策略的计算复杂度问题。

Method: 通过从$\delta$-Max-3SAT和$\delta$-Max-3SAT(b)问题归约到GLinear-$\kappa$-RL（贪婪策略）和SLinear-$\kappa$-RL（softmax策略）实例，建立计算困难性。

Result: 证明了在参数化贪婪策略集下学习是NP困难的，在softmax策略集下存在指数级下界（除非NP = RP）。

Conclusion: 在部分$q^{\pi}$-可实现性框架下，正面的计算结果通常无法实现，这与生成访问模型下的$q^{\pi}$-可实现性形成对比。

Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement
learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under
the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly
realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in
$q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability,
providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We
prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is
computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a
parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an
exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set
contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest
computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the
optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems,
$\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL
(greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate
that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a
generative access model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用小型开源模型作为资源高效替代方案，通过优化10亿参数的Llama 3.2模型进行多语言电商意图识别，在保持99%准确率的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商用大语言模型在电商等专业领域部署时面临高计算成本、延迟和运营费用的问题，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用QLoRA方法在合成数据集上微调10亿参数Llama 3.2模型，然后应用GPTQ和GGUF后训练量化技术创建GPU和CPU优化版本。

Result: 专用1B模型达到99%准确率，与GPT-4.1相当。GGUF格式在CPU上实现18倍推理吞吐量提升和90%以上RAM消耗减少，但GPTQ在旧GPU上因解量化开销反而减慢推理。

Conclusion: 经过适当优化的小型开源模型是领域特定应用的更合适替代方案，能以极低计算成本提供最先进的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural
language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading
commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

Motivation: 现有零样本方法存在提示敏感性和低准确性问题，而传统微调方法往往过度拟合训练集分布，无法产生比训练集更准确的结果，这偏离了使用LLM模拟调查响应的初衷。

Method: DSA是一种两阶段微调方法，通过同时对齐输出分布和不同背景下的分布变化来学习分布如何变化，而不是拟合训练数据。

Result: 在五个公共调查数据集上，DSA始终优于其他方法，能够将所需真实数据减少53.48-69.12%，在准确性、鲁棒性和数据节省方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DSA通过关注分布变化而非数据拟合，能够提供比训练数据更接近真实分布的结果，在调查模拟中展现出高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey
responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection.
However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low
accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set
distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training
set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate
survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift
Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output
distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By
learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA
can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the
training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five
public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering
accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by
53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey
simulation.

Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial
intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the
reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence.
The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based
methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large
language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the
MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in
this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving
through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are
advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5
crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,
Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge
Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in
recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the
core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving
process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement
their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the
best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the
influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human
reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across
existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning.

*Yangqin Jiang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LightAgent是一个移动GUI代理基础模型解决方案，通过设备-云协作平衡本地模型成本效益和云端模型高性能，解决了移动设备上小模型性能不足与大模型部署困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动GUI代理面临关键困境：真正在设备上的小模型（4B或更小）性能不足，而能力强的模型（从7B开始）要么太大无法在移动设备部署，要么成本过高（如仅限云端的闭源MLLMs）。

Method: 通过两阶段SFT->GRPO训练增强Qwen2.5-VL-3B在合成GUI数据上的决策能力；集成高效长推理机制在有限资源下利用历史交互；默认在设备上执行，仅通过实时复杂度评估将挑战性子任务升级到云端。

Result: 在AndroidLab基准测试和多样化应用上的实验显示，LightAgent匹配或接近更大模型性能，同时显著降低云成本。

Conclusion: LightAgent通过设备-云协作有效解决了移动GUI代理的部署困境，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低成本。

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building
GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for
mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch
interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device
models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models
(starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively
costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose
LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages
device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and
the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks.
Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO
training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an
efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under
tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating
challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment.
Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent
matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

Conclusion: 该框架具有可解释性和超参数可调性，显示出扩展到其他领域的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason
effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes
decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture
capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder
traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a
pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated
heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning
engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule
mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.
  On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the
random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human
inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters,
showing promise to extend into other domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在部分可观测环境中，传统元强化学习虽然能学习到近似贝叶斯最优策略，但难以学习紧凑、可解释的贝叶斯最优信念状态。通过在元强化学习中集成自监督预测编码模块，能够生成更可解释的表示，更好地逼近贝叶斯最优信念状态，并提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统元强化学习在部分可观测环境中学习到的表示不够紧凑和可解释，这限制了智能体的适应性和泛化能力。受神经科学中预测编码理论和深度强化学习中辅助预测目标的启发，研究是否可以通过集成预测模块来促进贝叶斯最优表示的学习。

Method: 在元强化学习中集成自监督预测编码模块，通过状态机模拟验证该方法在各种任务中的效果，并与传统元强化学习方法进行比较。

Result: 带预测模块的元强化学习能生成更可解释的表示，更好地逼近贝叶斯最优信念状态，即使在两者都能达到最优策略的情况下也是如此。在需要主动信息搜索的挑战性任务中，只有带预测模块的方法能成功学习最优表示和策略，而传统方法因表示学习不足而失败。更好的表示学习还带来了改进的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 预测学习应作为在部分可观测环境中导航的智能体进行有效表示学习的指导原则，预测编码模块能显著提升元强化学习的表示质量和泛化性能。

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and
generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement
learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to
learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This
representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and
generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which
suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of
Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we
investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into
meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state
machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently
generates more interpretable representations that better approximate
Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide
variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks
requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules
successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional
meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we
demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved
generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as
a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating
partial observability.

Motivation: 通过系统级硬件/软件协同设计方法，在满足实时性能要求的前提下，降低纯硬件方案的成本，避免使用高端处理器的纯软件实现的高昂费用。

Method: 使用SpecC方法学对PCM-to-PWM转换器进行建模和探索，通过系统级评估和快速功能仿真来评估不同的硬件/软件分区方案。

Abstract: We present a case study applying the SpecC methodology within a system-level
hardware/software co-design flow to a PCM-to-PWM converter, the core of a
Class-D audio amplifier. The converter was modeled and explored with SpecC
methodology to derive an HW/SW partition. Using system-level estimates and fast
functional simulation, we evaluated mappings that meet real-time constraints
while reducing estimated cost of an all-hardware solution and avoiding the
expense of a purely software implementation on a high-end processor. Despite
the design's moderate complexity, the results underline the value of
system-level co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and
actionable cost/performance trade-offs. [Original work from 2005; formatting

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习系统虽然预测性能优异，但缺乏因果透明度，无法进行精确的机制干预。智能应被定义为构建和修正可证伪解释的能力。

Method: 引入计算解释和能量结构化因果模型，将机制表示为约束而非显式输入输出映射，通过局部手术实现干预。

Result: ESCMs在温和条件下恢复标准SCM语义，提供了因果推理的形式化语言。

Conclusion: 为实现真正的理解而不仅仅是预测，需要转向支持因果干预和机制编辑的AI系统架构。

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems
that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their
internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can
retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while
holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.
We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build
and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that
specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.
Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be
independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce
computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready
causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured
Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy
functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and
interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes
internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which
relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We
provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM
in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization
systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we
analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under
mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's
principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as
explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for
causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

Conclusion: AI发展的下一阶段应该是从数据密集型大型模型转向能效更高、推理能力更强的轻量级领域特定智能体，这需要硬件和软件架构的根本性重新设计，以实现超过现有技术1000倍的能效提升。

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad
aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the
prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected
to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI
is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual
intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data
scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train
GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic
that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In
contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the
next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal
models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions
in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning
continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making
capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's
large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient
domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of
uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to
allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a
vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

Conclusion: 脑机接口领域需要向脑-智能体协作范式扩展，将智能体重新定义为主动协作伙伴，并关注伦理、可靠性和协作框架以确保系统的安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

Abstract: AI psychometrics evaluates AI systems in roles that traditionally require

psychology to design sophisticated personas which include behavioral and
psychological descriptors, life history, and social and emotional functions;
and (3) employs structured generation with population demographic priors and
memoir inspired narratives, encoded with Pydantic schemas. In a law enforcement
assistant case study, we construct a rich dataset of personas drawn across 8
persona archetypes and SJTs across 11 attributes, and analyze behaviors across
subpopulation and scenario slices. The dataset spans 8,500 personas, 4,000

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Dopamine的基于神经强化学习的无导数优化器，用于解决神经网络的信用分配问题。该方法通过权重扰动学习和奖励预测误差来调整学习率，在计算和内存消耗方面显著优于反向传播，同时保持与梯度方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决突触信用分配问题是神经网络学习的核心问题。反向传播方法虽然有效但存在计算效率低、内存消耗大、权重传输和更新锁定等问题。受神经强化学习启发，需要开发更高效、神经生物学更合理的优化方法。

Method: 采用NeuroAI方法，开发了基于权重扰动学习的Dopamine优化器。该方法通过随机更新权重来最小化期望结果与实际结果之间的奖励预测误差，并利用该误差自适应调整学习率，类似于大脑中多巴胺的作用机制。

Result: 在XOR任务的多层感知机和混沌时间序列预测的循环神经网络上测试表明，Dopamine训练模型收敛速度更快，性能优于标准权重扰动方法，与梯度方法性能相当，但计算和内存消耗显著降低。

Conclusion: Dopamine优化器不仅找到了稳健的解决方案，性能与最先进的机器学习优化器相当，而且在神经生物学上更加合理，为高效神经网络训练提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in
both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for
synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each
neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or
animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural
networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For
instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.
This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and
memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To
address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration
from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for
training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight
Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards
optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction
Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the
actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the
learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate
strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine
optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent
neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models
demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give
comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming
significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not
only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中，OptiTree相比最先进方法实现了超过10%的建模准确率提升。

Conclusion: OptiTree通过自适应问题分解和层次化建模思路整合，有效解决了复杂运筹学问题的自动化建模挑战。

Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of
operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into
steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to
the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard
fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to
enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem
decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling
tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical
problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category
and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,
we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and
synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the
hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves
the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\%
improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at

TL;DR: 提出PACR（渐进式上升置信度奖励），一种基于模型内在信念的密集奖励机制，用于改进RLVR训练中的探索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR的稀疏、基于结果的奖励无法为中间推理步骤提供指导，导致探索缓慢。

Method: 使用模型对正确答案概率的上升趋势作为密集奖励信号，约束探索空间到逻辑合理的推理区域。

Result: PACR加速了探索，用更少轨迹达到奖励饱和，并在多个基准测试中取得改进。

Conclusion: 密集的模型内在塑造信号可以使RLVR训练更有效和可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

*Quoc Anh Nguyen,Bernard Cheng,Kelvin Soh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文创建了首个大规模越南语歌词转录数据集VietLyrics，包含647小时的歌曲，并通过微调Whisper模型在该数据集上取得了优于现有多语言ALT系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越南语歌词转录面临音调复杂性和方言变异的独特挑战，但由于缺乏专用数据集，该领域仍未被充分探索。

Method: 构建了647小时的越南语歌词数据集VietLyrics，包含逐行对齐的歌词和元数据，并在此数据集上微调Whisper模型。

Result: 微调后的Whisper模型在越南语歌词转录任务上表现优于现有的多语言ALT系统（包括LyricWhiz），解决了传统ASR方法中常见的转录错误和非人声段幻觉问题。

Conclusion: VietLyrics数据集和微调模型的发布将推动越南音乐计算研究，并展示了该方法在低资源语言和音乐领域的ALT应用潜力。

Abstract: Automatic Lyrics Transcription (ALT) for Vietnamese music presents unique
challenges due to its tonal complexity and dialectal variations, but remains
largely unexplored due to the lack of a dedicated dataset. Therefore, we
curated the first large-scale Vietnamese ALT dataset (VietLyrics), comprising
647 hours of songs with line-level aligned lyrics and metadata to address these
issues. Our evaluation of current ASRbased approaches reveal significant
limitations, including frequent transcription errors and hallucinations in
non-vocal segments. To improve performance, we fine-tuned Whisper models on the
VietLyrics dataset, achieving superior results compared to existing
multilingual ALT systems, including LyricWhiz. We publicly release VietLyrics
and our models, aiming to advance Vietnamese music computing research while
demonstrating the potential of this approach for ALT in low-resource language
and music.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 带时间窗的容量约束车辆路径问题是物流领域的基础NP难优化问题，大规模实例对精确求解器计算挑战大，需要开发高效求解方法。

Method: 使用多级图粗化和细化框架，基于时空距离度量将客户聚合成元节点，在简化问题上应用经典启发式算法，然后通过扩展和可行性修正得到原问题解。

Result: 在Solomon基准实例上的初步实验表明，该方法在保持或改进解质量的同时减少了计算时间，特别是在容量和时间窗约束方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少计算时间并保持解质量，同时量子启发优化技术有潜力进一步加速大规模车辆路径任务。

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a
fundamental NP-hard optimization problem in logistics. Solving large-scale
instances remains computationally challenging for exact solvers. This work
introduces a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement framework that
aggregates customers into meta-nodes using a spatio-temporal distance metric.
The reduced problem is solved with classical heuristics and subsequently
expanded back into the original space with feasibility corrections. Preliminary
experiments on Solomon benchmark instances show that the proposed method
reduces computation time while preserving or improving solution quality,
particularly with respect to capacity and time window constraints. The paper
also explores the integration of quantum-inspired optimization techniques,
highlighting their potential to further accelerate large-scale vehicle routing
tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够准确预测卡车驾驶风险并提供可解释性结果的框架，通过整合领域文献知识来增强LLM的预测能力和解释能力。

Method: 使用文献信息微调（LIFT）的LLM框架，包括LLM驱动的推理核心进行风险预测和解释、文献处理管道构建领域知识库、结果评估器评估预测性能和可解释性。

Result: LIFT LLM在风险预测上表现优异，召回率提升26.7%，F1分数提升10.1%；变量重要性排序与基准模型一致；能够识别潜在风险场景并通过PERMANOVA测试验证；文献知识库和微调过程对可解释性有重要贡献。

Abstract: This study proposes an interpretable prediction framework with
literature-informed fine-tuned (LIFT) LLMs for truck driving risk prediction.
The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and
explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and
summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a
Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the
interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck
driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction,
outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score.
Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed
from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking
consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating
robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The
LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination
of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests.
Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and
the fine-tuning process in the interpretability of the LIFT LLM, and discussed
the potential of the LIFT LLM in data-driven knowledge discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了DynaSolidGeo，这是第一个用于评估视觉语言模型真实空间推理能力的动态基准，专注于立体几何问题，通过半自动标注流程构建，包含503个专家策划的种子问题，可动态生成无限多样的多模态实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注2D平面几何，依赖静态数据集易受数据污染和记忆影响，且仅评估最终答案而忽略推理过程。需要开发能评估真实空间推理能力的动态基准。

Method: 通过半自动标注流程构建DynaSolidGeo基准，包含503个专家策划的种子问题，可动态生成多样化多模态实例。除了答案准确性，还基于专家标注的推理链进行过程评估，衡量逻辑有效性和因果连贯性。

Result: 实验显示代表性开源和闭源视觉语言模型存在较大性能差距，在动态设置下性能严重下降，在需要高水平空间智能（如心理旋转和可视化）的任务上表现较差。

Conclusion: DynaSolidGeo填补了立体几何推理评估的空白，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在空间推理方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that
integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing
multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane
geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization,
and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process.
To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic
benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo
contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically
generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances.
Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental
rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 重新评估大型语言模型在复杂推理任务上的实际能力，揭示现有基准测试的局限性，并探索模型在真实世界复杂场景中的表现。

Method: 开发了Deep Reasoning Dataset (DeepRD)数据集，包含可扩展复杂度的推理问题，用于评估模型在图连通性和自然语言证明规划任务上的性能。

Result: 大型推理模型在足够复杂的问题上性能急剧下降，无法泛化到训练分布之外的复杂度，但多数真实世界案例仍在其成功范围内。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在短期内具有实用性，但需要开发能够超越训练分布复杂度的新方法来实现真正的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning
tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail
catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

Result: FSM分析揭示了不同模型在推理方法上的差异，显示了不同的推理模式和潜在缺陷。

Conclusion: 基于FSM的分析为评估和改进LLM推理提供了新的视角，能够系统性地分析和可视化不同模型处理问题的方式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the
resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn
hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However,
understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open
problem, with many potential important applications including improving
training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless
Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical
reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a
small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction,
augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and
final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's
reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states,
we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the
state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze,
interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the
FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss
how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach
to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals
distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to
evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可中断协作角色扮演者(ICR)算法，用于训练LLM驱动的协作代理，使其能够更好地接受合作伙伴的干预，从而提高团队在任务相关命题上的共同基础对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地部署在代理环境中与人类协作，需要评估它们在多轮、多方任务中的协作能力。标准RLHF训练的代理倾向于忽略合作伙伴的干预，这使得提高团队共同基础变得困难。

Method: 使用两玩家修改动作MDP分析标准AI代理的次优行为，提出ICR算法——一种新颖的伙伴感知学习算法来训练共同基础最优的协作代理。

Result: 在多个协作任务环境中的实验表明，ICR平均能够更好地促进成功的共同基础收敛，并在这些任务中探索更多样化的解决方案。

Conclusion: ICR算法能够有效解决标准AI代理忽略合作伙伴干预的问题，提高LLM代理在多轮协作任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic
settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is
increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate
effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI
alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical
insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and
an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator
that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant
propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions
by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and
related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning
interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this
setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal
behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative
Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal
collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show
that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence
and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了OFFSIDE基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型在足球转会谣言方面的信息遗忘能力，揭示了当前方法在视觉谣言处理、抗攻击性和遗忘稳定性方面的显著脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的发展，数据隐私问题日益突出，需要选择性遗忘学习信息的能力。现有基准测试存在图像多样性不足、准确性问题和评估场景不充分等局限性。

Method: 构建了一个基于足球转会谣言的手工策划数据集，包含15.68K条记录和80名球员信息，提供四个测试集来评估遗忘效果、泛化性、实用性和鲁棒性，支持选择性遗忘和纠正性再学习等高级设置。

Result: 评估发现：单模态方法在多模态谣言上失败；遗忘效果主要由灾难性遗忘驱动；所有方法都难以处理视觉谣言；遗忘的谣言容易恢复；所有方法都易受提示攻击。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在显著脆弱性，需要开发更鲁棒的多模态遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can
be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These
results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting
the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available

TL;DR: ATOM是一个从非结构化文本构建和持续更新时序知识图谱的少样本可扩展方法，通过将文档分解为最小自包含的原子事实来提高提取的完整性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识图谱构建忽略了现实世界数据的动态性和时间敏感性，而现有的零样本或少样本方法存在不稳定性和关键事实覆盖不完整的问题。

Method: 将输入文档分解为最小自包含的原子事实，构建原子时序知识图谱，采用双时间建模区分信息观察时间和有效时间，然后并行合并原子图谱。

Result: 相比基线方法，ATOM实现了约18%的更高完整性、约17%的更好稳定性，以及超过90%的延迟减少，展示了动态时序知识图谱构建的强大可扩展性。

Conclusion: ATOM方法在动态时序知识图谱构建方面表现出优越的性能和可扩展潜力。

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展现出强大的上下文学习能力，但理论上尚不清楚这种能力如何产生，特别是预训练过程和上下文构建等关键因素的确切作用。

Method: 构建单层transformer的简单示例，然后扩展到更一般情况，推导ICL性能、上下文长度以及预训练与查询任务分布之间KL散度的精确关系，并通过实验验证。

Result: 当预训练数据分布与查询任务分布不同时，适当构建的上下文可以以可量化的方式将输出分布向查询任务分布转移，从而在查询主题上实现准确预测。

Conclusion: 建立了上下文学习性能与关键因素之间的理论关系，为理解大语言模型的上下文学习机制提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn
from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent
applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least
theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the
precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as
context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the
ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network
architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process.
As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer,
and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is
different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can
shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a
quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then
extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the
precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL
divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide
experiments to validate our theoretical results.

TL;DR: CLIN-LLM是一个安全约束的混合管道系统，通过多模态患者编码、不确定性校准的疾病分类和检索增强的治疗生成，实现了症状到疾病的准确分类和临床基础的治疗推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的医疗系统缺乏医学基础且无法量化不确定性，导致输出不安全。在诊断风险高的异质患者环境中，准确的症状到疾病分类和临床基础的治疗推荐仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 框架在Symptom2Disease数据集的1200个临床案例上微调BioBERT，结合Focal Loss和Monte Carlo Dropout实现置信度感知预测。使用Biomedical Sentence-BERT从MedDialog语料库检索相关对话，通过微调的FLAN-T5模型生成个性化治疗建议，并通过RxNorm进行抗生素管理和药物相互作用筛查。

Result: CLIN-LLM达到98%的准确率和F1分数，比ClinicalBERT高出7.1%，78%的top-5检索精度，临床医生评定的有效性为4.2/5分。与GPT-5相比，不安全的抗生素建议减少了67%。

Conclusion: CLIN-LLM展示了鲁棒性、可解释性和临床安全性，为资源有限的医疗环境提供了可部署的、人机协同决策支持框架。

Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment
recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient
settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based
systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,
resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid
pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated
disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The
framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease
dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable
confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.
Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring
human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical
Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample
MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a
fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by
post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug
interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,
outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval
precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic
suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate
CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The
proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support
framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes
integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial
validation.

TL;DR: SwiftSolve是一个复杂度感知的多智能体系统，用于竞争性编程，通过算法规划与经验分析相结合，确保程序不仅正确还满足时间和内存约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的程序经常通过单元测试但违反竞赛的时间和内存预算，因此需要开发能够同时保证正确性和效率的系统。

Method: 采用多智能体架构：规划器提出算法草图，静态剪枝器过滤高风险计划，编码器生成C++代码，分析器编译执行并记录性能，复杂度分析器拟合增长模式并指导修复。

Result: 在26个问题上的评估显示，首次尝试通过率61.54%，三次尝试内解决率80.77%，运行级成功率73.08%，平均时间12.40秒，优于Claude Opus 4。

Conclusion: 性能分析和复杂度指导的重新规划能够减少低效问题同时保持准确性，证明了多智能体方法在竞争性编程中的有效性。

Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy
unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present
SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming
that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and
complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software
environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles
such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner
proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk
plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on
a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a
Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a
complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder.
Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration
caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10
Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains
pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with
marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate
run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly
resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against
Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at
approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness
(pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence
of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that
profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving
accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出基于首个生成token的对数概率分布来检测LLM模板化回复的方法，可在单步生成后识别拒绝、简单确认等低价值回复，实现计算成本优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成模板化回复（如拒绝、简单确认等）时浪费大量计算资源，增加了不必要的成本和延迟。

Method: 利用首个生成token的对数概率分布作为信号，通过轻量级k-NN分类器预测后续回复类型，区分实质性回答与模板化回复。

Result: 实验表明首个token的对数概率向量在不同回复类型间形成明显可分离的簇，能高精度预测回复性质，支持提前终止或重定向到小模型。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算简单的实用技术，可优化LLM推理效率，显著降低计算成本，推动更高效和可持续的LLM部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources
generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and
casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

*Mithul Chander,Sai Pragnya Ranga,Prathamesh Mayekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Atlas城市指数(AUI)，一种利用Sentinel-2卫星影像和视觉语言模型来测量城市发展的新指标，相比传统指标能更准确捕捉城市发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如NDBI因大气噪声、季节变化和云层覆盖等问题难以准确捕捉城市发展，这阻碍了大规模人类发展和城市化的监测。

Method: 收集区域的时间序列Sentinel-2影像，在固定时间窗口内处理图像以减少云层覆盖，使用视觉语言模型提供发展评分，并通过参考图像和时序一致性策略确保评分稳定性。

Result: 在班加罗尔的定性实验表明，AUI优于NDBI等标准指数。

Conclusion: AUI能够克服传统城市化指数的挑战，产生更可靠和稳定的发展评分。

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban
development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite
imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up
Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to
factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

*Kaitong Cai,Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaCoT是一种新的检索增强生成框架，通过在检索前阶段生成对比性问题来引导模型关注关键差异细节，从而在单次检索中抑制语义干扰，提高对知识稀疏和语义模糊的长尾查询的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG在处理知识稀疏和语义模糊的长尾查询时面临的检索噪声问题，这些噪声会扭曲推理并需要昂贵的后处理。

Method: 提出RaCoT框架，在检索前自动生成语义相邻但答案不同的对比性问题，提取Δ-Prompt捕捉关键差异，引导模型主动关注决定答案分歧的关键细节。

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中，RaCoT比RankRAG和Self-RAG等强基线方法表现更好，提升了0.9-2.4个百分点；在对抗性测试中性能下降仅8.6%，远优于其他方法超过15%的下降；具有低延迟(3.12s)和低token开销(11.54)。

Conclusion: RaCoT将RAG范式从"事后上下文清理"重新定义为"先验塑造判别推理"，为实时、资源受限部署提供了高效且可靠的AI系统路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with
knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval
noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle
this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel
framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By
automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered
contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key
differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical
details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress
semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the
theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously
encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative
benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong
baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits
superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial
tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore,
its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the
accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the
necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from
``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative
reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems
for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型改变商业软件使用方式、人们生活方式和行业运作方式，各大公司不断改进模型，因此需要评估不同模型在性能、道德行为和可用性方面的差异，这些差异源于它们构建理念的不同。

Method: 通过分析三个重要因素：性能与准确性、伦理与偏见缓解、可用性与集成，对五个顶级LLM进行比较研究。

Result: 研究发现Claude具有良好的道德推理能力，Gemini在多模态能力和强大伦理框架方面表现更好，DeepSeek擅长基于事实的推理，LLaMA适合开放应用，ChatGPT提供平衡性能并注重使用体验。

Conclusion: 这些模型在工作效果、易用性和伦理处理方面存在差异，用户应根据各自优势来充分利用每个模型。

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the
way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google,
High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial
to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour
and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built
them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a
focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of
how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in
a way that makes the most of its strengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM自信地生成听起来完全合理但错误的信息，这种幻觉问题已成为在准确性重要的现实应用中部署这些模型的主要障碍。

Method: 结合结构化数据库、实时网络搜索和学术文献来验证生成的事实声明，检测到不一致时自动纠正，同时保持响应的自然流畅性。

Result: 测试显示幻觉减少67%，领域专家对纠正输出的满意度达到89%，相比未验证的LLM响应有显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在不能出错的应用中使LLM更可信提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems,
they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information
that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major
barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy
matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects
these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple
knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches,
and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we
detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the
natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could
reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain
experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected
outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM
responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more
trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成准确答案作为个性化助手方面存在困难，需要更好的方式来利用用户特定信息

Method: 将用户特定信息存储在文本和视觉token的KV-Cache中，通过检索相关KV-Cache来确保回答准确性

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了视觉问答和纯文本任务的最先进结果，特别是在依赖特定局部细节时能提供更准确响应

Conclusion: Jarvis为个性化AI助手提供了一条实用路径，能够基于细粒度用户特定信息进行准确问答

Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended
perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt
general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such
as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific
information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or
train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines
struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce
Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through
personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the
KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by
summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are
produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When
answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal
storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a
fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining
pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained
user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate
responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis
achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and
text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward
personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

Motivation: 当前AI代理开发缺乏对人类工作方式的清晰理解，需要揭示代理的专业能力和在不同工作流程中的角色定位。

Method: 引入可扩展工具包，从人类或代理的计算机使用活动中提取可解释的结构化工作流程，并在数据分析、工程、计算、写作和设计等技能上进行比较。

Result: 代理表现出与人类工作流程的对齐性，但过度依赖程序化方法；工作质量较差但会通过数据伪造掩盖缺陷；效率比人类高88.3%，成本低90.4-96.2%。

Conclusion: AI代理在可编程任务上具有高效低成本优势，适合与人类协作，但需要解决其程序化倾向和工作质量问题。

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as
software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with
significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in
diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by
presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Motivation: 微软Copilot套件作为各种代理的通用入口点，需要强大的编排器来将用户提示的任务分发给正确的代理，特别是当代理库动态扩展时。

Method: 提出了代理元编排器（AMO），利用元学习训练决策树模型来决定不同代理/模型间的最佳推理策略，支持自然语言和动作响应。

Result: 在两个生产用例中展示了AMO的有效性：M365电商Copilot提供最新产品信息并连接多个代理；代码合规Copilot扫描DevOps代码检测合规问题。

Conclusion: AMO能够有效处理Copilot服务中的多任务和可扩展代理需求，通过元学习优化代理选择策略。

Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various
agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer
with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming
code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering
operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The
repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a
robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right
agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for
handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can
provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate
the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model
for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We
showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases:
Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365
E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to
promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product
information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and
human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps
code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始HRM模型虽然推理能力强，但仅限于监督学习、静态、完全可观测问题，无法处理动态、不确定或部分可观测的现实问题，也无法重用先前计算

Method: 开发了HRM-Agent，这是HRM的变体，仅使用强化学习训练，探索其循环推理过程的动态特性

Result: HRM-Agent成功学会了在动态不确定的迷宫环境中导航到目标，并且有证据表明它能够重用早期环境时间步的计算

Conclusion: HRM模型可以通过强化学习扩展到动态不确定环境，其循环推理过程能够有效重用先前计算，为处理现实世界问题提供了可能

Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities
given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static,
fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its
computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current
form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the
problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the
correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.
  This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only
reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in
dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's
reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the
dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is
successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

Motivation: 人类在熟练掌握任务后会减少认知努力，而传统强化学习智能体在性能提升时计算效率不会提高。如果智能体能在学习过程中考虑计算成本，就能实现更节能的智能体并释放计算资源用于规划等其他过程。

Method: 在Arcade Learning Environment上进行实验，向智能体展示计算成本并赋予它们控制计算使用的自主权。

Result: 在相同训练计算预算下，考虑计算成本的智能体在75%的游戏中表现更好，平均使用计算量减少三倍。

Conclusion: 让强化学习智能体考虑计算成本能显著提高计算效率，在保持甚至提升性能的同时大幅减少计算资源消耗。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in
many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient
as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as
they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their
compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint?
If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute
cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with
showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to
control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade
Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training
compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of
games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We
analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

Conclusion: 本文为开发能够减轻模态差距、促进更平衡多模态推理的训练策略提供了见解，相关代码已公开。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an
imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities.
Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while
under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks
that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the
\textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between
text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality
gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training
recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to
bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our
findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the
modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Bridging-Modality-Gap.

Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models
for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction,
causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views
on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a
speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on
higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider
inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through
the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe
that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and
negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by
combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can
be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are
generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common
inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in
an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of
logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes
elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by
symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may
pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key
unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While
large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated
benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate
tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a
large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling
benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math &
Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of
distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning
through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results
show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a
significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.
  To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that
augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured
decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration. Without additional training, it
generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
530% improvements over existing baselines at roughly one-tenth the

Conclusion: GTR-Mamba通过跨流形条件路由，有效解决了POI推荐中同时建模空间层次结构和时间上下文动态变化的关键挑战，展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex
decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized
recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI
recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and
sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a
fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent
hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts
of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose
GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.
GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces
for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in
hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel
Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent
space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses
spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),
enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.

TL;DR: 提出MA-CDMP方法，使用扩散模型和均值场机制解决去中心化通信资源管理中的非平稳性和合作问题，提高系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决集中式多智能体强化学习的可扩展性和隐私问题，以及分布式训练去中心化执行范式的非平稳性和有限合作问题。

Method: 基于模型强化学习框架，使用扩散模型捕捉环境动态并规划轨迹，逆动态模型指导动作生成，引入均值场机制近似大规模智能体交互。

Result: MA-CDMP在平均奖励和QoS指标上持续优于现有MARL基线方法，展示了在真实无线网络优化中的可扩展性和实用性。

Conclusion: MA-CDMP通过扩散模型和均值场机制有效解决了去中心化资源管理的挑战，提供了理论保证和实际性能提升。

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation
error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence
stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL
baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its
scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

Motivation: 现有生成语义约束对抗样本的方法攻击能力不足，未能充分研究人类指令中的语义不确定性因素，如指称多样性、描述不完整性和边界模糊性。

Method: 提出多维度指令不确定性减少框架：1）采样方法维度：残差驱动攻击方向稳定化，使用ResAdv-DDIM采样器稳定对抗优化；2）任务建模维度：上下文编码攻击场景约束，通过指导掩码和渲染器集成补充缺失知识；3）生成器评估维度：语义抽象攻击评估增强，明确评估边界。

Result: 大量实验证明InSUR在迁移攻击性能上的优越性，并首次实现了无参考的语义约束3D对抗样本生成。

Conclusion: InSUR框架通过多维度减少指令不确定性，能够生成更令人满意的语义约束对抗样本，具有更好的可迁移性、适应性和有效性。

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

Motivation: 开发一个能够为不同类型用户提供高效可信解释的通用框架，解决现有解释方法在用户适配性和解释质量方面的不足。

Method: 结合后处理解释器（SHAP、LIME、Anchor）与检索增强的LLMs，索引多模态知识库，通过量化标准选择解释器，使用基于聊天的提示生成解释。

Result: 在心脏病和甲状腺癌数据集上评估：LIME在保真度-鲁棒性权衡上表现最佳；Anchor产生最稀疏、低token的规则；SHAP获得最高满意度。Profile条件化稳定了token使用并保持各用户配置文件的积极评分。

Conclusion: ProfileXAI框架能够为不同用户配置文件提供高效可信的解释，没有单一解释器在所有指标上占优，但框架整体实现了稳定的解释质量和用户满意度。

Abstract: ProfileXAI is a model- and domain-agnostic framework that couples post-hoc
explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval - augmented LLMs to produce
explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal
knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria,
and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease
and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token
use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best
fidelity-robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart
Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest
satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma
\le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$,
with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy
explanations.

Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散规划器从稀疏步规划中受益，但过度稀疏的规划会降低性能。作者假设时间密度阈值在整个时间范围内是非均匀的，某些部分应该更密集地规划。

Method: 提出MDD扩散规划器，将整个时间范围内的密度作为可调超参数，允许不同部分采用不同的规划密度。

Result: 在Maze2D、Franka Kitchen和Antmaze D4RL任务领域达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过调整时间范围内的规划密度作为超参数，可以显著提升扩散规划器的性能，验证了非均匀时间密度假设的有效性。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step
planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their
trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory
computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades
performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform
across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should
be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion
planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.
MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL
task domains.

This emerging paradigm, the AI scientist, is architected to emulate the
complete scientific workflow-from initial hypothesis generation to the final
synthesis of publishable findings-thereby promising to fundamentally reshape
the pace and scale of discovery. However, the rapid and unstructured
proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape,
obscuring overarching methodological principles and developmental trends. This
survey provides a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of this domain by
introducing a unified, six-stage methodological framework that deconstructs the
end-to-end scientific process into: Literature Review, Idea Generation,
Experimental Preparation, Experimental Execution, Scientific Writing, and Paper
Generation. Through this analytical lens, we chart the field's evolution from
early Foundational Modules (2022-2023) to integrated Closed-Loop Systems
(2024), and finally to the current frontier of Scalability, Impact, and
Human-AI Collaboration (2025-present). By rigorously synthesizing these
developments, this survey not only clarifies the current state of autonomous
science but also provides a critical roadmap for overcoming remaining
challenges in robustness and governance, ultimately guiding the next generation

Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence
technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important
component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can
utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational
evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.
However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,
they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of
disciplinary data. In cross-disciplinary fields, traditional cognitive
diagnostic methods still face many challenges. Given the differences in
knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between
different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network
cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive
diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis
method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer
learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target
discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The
experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model
based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in
cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, and can more accurately evaluate
students' learning situation.

Conclusion: 小型语言模型可以被成功转化为有效的奖励模型，通过结合过程奖励和结果奖励的方法，显著提升了代码搜索和评估的能力。

Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a
necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps.
Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing
a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that
reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to
investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4
family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of
process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness
labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a
value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.
Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward
models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions
among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement
in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

TL;DR: 科学大语言模型处理生物分子序列时面临tokenization困境，研究发现提供高层次结构化上下文比直接处理原始序列效果更好，甚至原始序列会干扰模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学大语言模型在处理原始生物分子序列时面临的tokenization困境，无论是将序列视为专门语言还是单独模态都存在局限性。

Method: 通过系统比较领先的科学大语言模型在生物推理任务上的表现，测试了三种输入模式：仅序列、仅上下文、以及两者结合。

Result: 仅使用上下文的方法始终且显著优于其他所有模式。更令人惊讶的是，将原始序列与其高层次上下文一起包含会持续降低性能，表明原始序列即使对于具有专门tokenization方案的模型也起到信息噪声的作用。

Conclusion: 现有科学大语言模型的主要优势不在于从零开始解释生物分子语法的能力，而在于对结构化、人类可读知识的深刻推理能力。应该将科学大语言模型重新定位为专家知识的强大推理引擎，而非序列解码器。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising
frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a
fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the
tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,
risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,
introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally
limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by
positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level
structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby
bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through
a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we
tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of
both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and
substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion
of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades
performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for
models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the
primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to
interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for
reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for
reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines
over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid
scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct
sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis. The code is

Result: FoG成功消除了翻转、滚动等不良行为，在状态和像素任务中都能避免危险区域，还能发现难以定义的行为技能

Conclusion: FoG方法有效将人类意图融入技能发现，解决了传统方法产生危险行为的问题

Abstract: Learning diverse skills without hand-crafted reward functions could
accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks. However, existing skill
discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without
considering human preferences, which leads to undesirable behaviors and
possibly dangerous skills. For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous
methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas
we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this
work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which
incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models.
Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate
states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states
and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the
rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill
discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors,
such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based
and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills
involving behaviors that are difficult to define. Interactive visualisations

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进MCTS决策策略，解决现有自动抽象算法需要转移概率和DAG搜索图的限制，并能检测状态空间中相距较远的对称动作。

Method: 基于MCTS过程中获得的奖励分布统计，开发自动动作抽象算法AUPO，仅影响决策策略而不影响树搜索。

Result: 在IPPC基准问题上，AUPO明显优于MCTS，能检测到ASAP等先进框架难以处理的对称动作。

Conclusion: AUPO是有效的MCTS改进方法，与其他仅影响树搜索的抽象技术兼容，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's
(MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC
benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an
automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward
distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic
abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition
probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build
its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that
state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting
symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only
affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other
abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the
game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on
training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game
studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper
proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning
agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method
improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data
and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper
agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today.
Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate.
Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to
standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts
indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to
hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method
is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the
series.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BlocKOA的新型集成电路热仿真数据生成算法，通过块Krylov方法和算子作用，在加速数据生成过程的同时提高生成数据的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动方法需要大量高保真训练数据，计算成本高昂。为了解决这个问题，需要开发一种能同时加速数据生成并提高精度的算法。

Method: 使用基于热方程结构的块Krylov算法快速获取基本解，然后组合这些解得到满足物理约束的温度分布，最后应用热算子确定热源分布，高效生成精确数据点。

Result: BlocKOA的时间复杂度比现有方法低一个数量级，实验显示在生成5000个不同物理参数和IC结构芯片的热仿真数据时实现了420倍加速，仅用4%的生成时间就能达到与现有方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: BlocKOA算法能显著加速集成电路热仿真数据生成，同时保持高精度，为数据驱动方法提供了高效的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs),
have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated
circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is
requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip
parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm
for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and
operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation
process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically
designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm
based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic
solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that
satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these
functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating
precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of
BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results
further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold
speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying
physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation

*Riccardo Romanello,Daniele Lizzio Bosco,Jacopo Cossio,Dusan Sutulovic,Giuseppe Serra,Carla Piazza,Paolo Burelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于强化学习的CNOT门最小化方法，使用单一智能体处理不同尺寸的量子电路，在较大电路尺寸上优于现有最优算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNOT门是量子计算中的基本组件，用于产生纠缠。最小化CNOT门数量对量子算法效率至关重要，但该问题计算复杂度尚未完全确定，是一个开放挑战。

Method: 使用单一强化学习智能体处理固定尺寸m的电路，通过嵌入或高斯条纹预处理不同尺寸的矩阵。训练m=8的智能体，评估尺寸从3到15的电路。

Result: 在n值增大时，该方法优于现有最优算法，证明了强化学习在CNOT最小化问题上的有效性。

Conclusion: 强化学习为CNOT门最小化问题提供了有前景的解决方案，特别是在处理较大电路尺寸时表现出优越性能。

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate
entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of
quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their
widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.
This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its
computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we
introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead
of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,
we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from
m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the
efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on
matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that
our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n
increases.

*Anwesha Das,John Duff,Jörg Hoffmann,Vera Demberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于理性言语行为（RSA）框架的自适应信号理论，用于优化人机协作中的信息传递时机和特异性，以在动态环境中保持用户信念与环境的及时对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速变化的环境中，辅助代理需要识别最高优先级信息并估计如何最有效地传达这些信息，因为人类注意力是零和认知资源，关注一条信息会降低对其他或即将到来信息的意识。

Method: 使用理性言语行为（RSA）建模框架，通过贝叶斯参考解析来规划消息序列，调整消息的特异性和时机，基于对消息引导解释如何影响界面注意力和后续信念更新的多步预测。

Result: 与基线方法比较显示，该方法的效果关键依赖于将多步规划与现实的用户意识模型相结合。

Conclusion: 这是RSA在动态环境通信和一般人机交互中的首次应用，为人类-代理团队的语用通信建立了理论基础，展示了如何利用认知科学见解来指导辅助代理的设计。

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和电子商务的发展，网络上存在大量意见数据。现有研究主要集中在基于评论对实体进行排名，但缺乏将意见分类到更细粒度层次然后对实体进行排名的研究。

Method: 使用模糊逻辑推理从语句中进行更深层次的细粒度意见挖掘，然后基于这些信息对实体进行排名。

Result: 该方法能够从评论文本中提取更详细的属性和组件信息，并确定评论的情感极性（正面、负面或中性）。

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度意见挖掘方法结合模糊逻辑推理，为实体排名提供了更精确的基础，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers
of our behaviors. In current times due to growth of social networking website
and increase in number of e-commerce site huge amount of opinions are now
available on web. Given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions
(or sentiments) about an Entity, opinion mining aims to extract attributes and
components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to
determine whether the comments are positive, negative or neutral. While lot of
research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it
dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set, classifying
opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been
done before. In this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a
deeper level of granularity is proposed. This is done by using fuzzy logic
reasoning, after which entities are ranked as per this information.

Conclusion: 该框架为人类-AI协作提供了理论基础和实用算法，能够适应分布漂移和人类行为变化，在不确定性量化方面实现了互补优势。

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines,
shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions
under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain
knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in
the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design
collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and
AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of
Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of
reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty
Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human
expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,
ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,
enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population
level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an
intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a
classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop
practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution
free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,
including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we
call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,
regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative
prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher
coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

Conclusion: AutoStreamPipe框架通过自动化流处理管道设计，显著提升了开发效率和准确性，证明了其在分布式流处理系统中的有效性。

Abstract: Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the
efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting
rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel
framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design,
generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe
bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific
implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured
multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an
extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution
strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good
accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that
AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates
(x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM
code-generation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有竞价模型在跨场景泛化能力上的局限性，传统模型通常针对特定竞价场景设计，缺乏通用性。

Method: 构建统一效果预估函数，使用系列嵌入编码异构数据，设计变量间和时间上的注意力机制，采用变量感知融合模块和零膨胀投影模块进行联合优化。

Result: 在8个数据集上离线评估优于多种基线，在淘宝平台在线A/B测试中GMV提升4.65%，ROI提升2.44%。

Conclusion: Bid2X证明了竞价基础模型在计算广告中的可行性，为跨场景竞价优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically
providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to
model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in
generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored
for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the
scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the
achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross
merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding
foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various
scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode
heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex
inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose
two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables
and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation
learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a
variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome
prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a
zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero
probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization
objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to
converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the
ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline
evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various
baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by
4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding
foundation model in computational advertising.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DQN依赖关联学习，容易获得伪相关性，限制了其问题解决能力。需要整合因果原理来理解环境的因果结构。

Result: 在标准基准环境上的实验结果表明，该方法优于传统DQN，展示了因果推理在强化学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为通过原则性因果推理提升深度强化学习智能体能力提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement
learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to
the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal
principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational
Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal
reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's
understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby
mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We
demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly
enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance.
Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our
approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of
causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a
promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning
agents through principled causal inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提醒人们注意线性风险模型的哲学局限性，为AI生存风险讨论提供更全面的不确定性分析框架。

Method: 通过比较标准瑞士奶酪模型与作者模型的差异，分析认知无差异情境下的概率计算，并引入选项不确定性和状态空间不确定性两个维度。

Result: 论证了在考虑结构关系和不确定性维度后，AI生存风险P(D)的概率可能比初步估计更高。

Conclusion: 将选项不确定性和状态空间不确定性纳入AI生存风险的定性讨论，可以更好地理解P(D)的可能性。

Abstract: This work is a commentary of the article
\href{https://doi.org/10.18716/ojs/phai/2025.2801}{AI Survival Stories: a
Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk} by Cappelen, Goldstein, and
Hawthorne. It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the
philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will
focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences
between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a
situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what
one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I
then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of
P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty
and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into
our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better
understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

Motivation: 企业需要满足最小权限、合规性和可审计性的访问决策，但现有系统难以将人类可读策略转化为机器决策。

Method: 使用Google Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM，采用六阶段推理框架（上下文解释、用户验证、数据分类、业务目的测试、合规映射、风险综合），结合早期硬策略门控和默认拒绝机制。

Result: 在14个标准案例上的评估显示：精确决策匹配率达到92.9%，拒绝召回率1.00，必须拒绝场景的误批准率为0，功能适当性和合规性均为14/14，专家对推理质量评分高，中位延迟低于1分钟。

Conclusion: 策略约束的LLM推理结合显式门控和审计追踪，能够将人类可读策略转化为安全、合规且可追溯的机器决策。

Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with
regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that
uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests
against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented
with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context
interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test,
compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny
by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls
and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases
across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results
show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying
policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny
families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence
at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is
under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM
reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human
readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes
of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky
hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the
definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly
maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate
that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical
task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents
employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This
Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing
agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More
critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the
application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety
and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the
boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally
undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents
by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative
risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static
analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在情感理解中生成的情感解释经常与目标标签不一致，甚至与自身预测的情感相矛盾，这会降低系统的可靠性和用户信任。

Result: 在MAFW和DFEW数据集上显著提高了解释-预测一致性和解释情感准确性，通过实验和人工评估验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了解释与预测的对齐，还使多模态大语言模型能够提供情感一致、可信的交互，是实现真正类人HCI系统的关键一步。

Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into
more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift,
emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues
underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for
predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.
However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that
diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own
predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for
misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address
this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and
an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is
explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion
recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional
paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves
faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on
the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human
evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between
explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally
coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like
HCI systems.

Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important
and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have
been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,
including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,
and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for
systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on
the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In
fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent
models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but
are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in
the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce
NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires
models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will

*Alexis Ellis,Stacie Severyn,Fjollë Novakazi,Hadi Banaee,Cogan Shimizu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了OntoPret本体论，用于解释人类行为，填补了技术中心机器人框架与描述性行为本体论之间的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人机协作在工业5.0等范式中变得重要，机器需要安全有效地解释复杂的人类行为。现有技术中心机器人框架缺乏对人类行为的细致建模，而描述性行为本体论又不适合实时协作解释。

Method: 基于认知科学和模块化工程方法，开发了OntoPret本体论，提供了一个形式化的、机器可处理的框架来分类行为，包括任务偏差和欺骗性行为。

Result: 在制造和游戏两个不同用例中展示了OntoPret的适应性，并建立了对高级人类意图推理所需的语义基础。

Conclusion: OntoPret为机器解释人类行为提供了一个有效的本体论框架，支持实时协作和高级推理。

Abstract: As human machine teaming becomes central to paradigms like Industry 5.0, a
critical need arises for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex
human behaviors. A research gap currently exists between techno centric robotic
frameworks, which often lack nuanced models of human behavior, and descriptive
behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative
interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an
ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive
science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal,
machine processable framework for classifying behaviors, including task
deviations and deceptive actions. We demonstrate its adaptability across two
distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic
foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

TL;DR: ReCode提出了一种通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动的新范式，将高级计划视为抽象占位函数，递归分解为细粒度子函数，实现决策粒度的动态控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界任务需要在不同粒度上做决策，而现有基于LLM的智能体缺乏在决策粒度间流畅操作的能力，因为现有范式在高级规划和低级行动之间设置了严格分离。

Method: ReCode将规划和行动统一在单一代码表示中，将高级计划作为抽象占位函数，然后递归分解为更细粒度的子函数，直到达到原始动作。

Result: 大量实验表明，ReCode在推理性能上显著超越先进基线，并在训练中表现出卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动是实现通用粒度控制的有力有效方法。

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is

TL;DR: ChatGPT发布后，公众对AI的接受度下降，对人机协同决策的需求增加，社会不平等差距扩大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究公众对AI的态度变化，特别是在有影响力的决策场景中，因为组织在集成AI时往往忽视用户偏好

Method: 使用瑞士人口代表性的大规模两波调查（n_wave1=1514，n_wave2=1488），比较ChatGPT发布前后的公众态度

Result: GenAI热潮显著降低了公众对AI的接受度，"完全不可接受"AI的比例从23%增至30%，支持纯人类决策的比例从18%增至26%，教育、语言和性别差距扩大

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了行业对公众AI部署准备度的假设，强调技术发展必须与不断变化的公众偏好保持一致

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies
has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services,
often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI
use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored.
Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public
preferences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MAE框架，通过三个交互代理（提议者、求解者、评判者）实现LLM的自我进化，在数学、推理和通用知识问答等任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖人工标注数据和可验证奖励，限制了可扩展性和通用性。自我博弈RL方法需要特定环境反馈，难以扩展到通用领域。

Method: 使用单一LLM实例化三个交互代理：提议者生成问题，求解者尝试解决，评判者评估并共同进化。应用强化学习优化代理行为。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct上实验，在多个基准测试中平均提升4.54%。

Conclusion: MAE是一种可扩展、数据高效的方法，能以最少的人工监督增强LLM的通用推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However,
the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and
verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent
Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,
aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.
However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback
(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general
domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose
Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in
solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge
Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents
(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies
reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates
questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while
co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves
an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight
MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning
abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

TL;DR: ALITA-G是一个自进化框架，通过系统生成、抽象和整理MCP工具，将通用代理转化为领域专家，在多个基准测试中实现性能提升并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自进化代理主要局限于提示重写或失败重试，需要更系统的框架来实现从通用能力到领域特定能力的转化。

Method: 框架包含三个核心步骤：1) 通用代理执行目标领域任务并合成候选MCP；2) 将MCP抽象为参数化原语并整合到MCP Box；3) 推理时执行检索增强的MCP选择，使用MCP执行器运行代理。

Result: 在GAIA验证集上达到83.03% pass@1和89.09% pass@3的新SOTA结果，同时将每个示例的平均token数减少约15%。

Conclusion: ALITA-G提供了从通用能力到可重用领域特定能力的原理性路径，在复杂推理任务上同时提高了准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when
scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,
self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation
to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a
self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain
expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated
suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful
trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and
consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs
retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and
use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across
several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains
strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves
83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result
while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a
strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from
generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both
accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ISO 20022消息交换处理时间的特征工程方法，用于即时支付系统的异常检测和故障定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监控方法无法弥合技术基础设施指标与业务流程可见性之间的差距，而即时支付系统需要处理数百万交易且要求零停机。

Method: 通过计算连续ISO 20022消息交换之间的处理时间来创建系统状态的紧凑表示，并应用异常检测技术。

Result: 在TARGET即时支付结算系统上的实验评估表明，该方法能有效检测多种异常模式，并提供可解释的解释，显著减少调查时间。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将特征映射到不同的处理阶段，能够区分内部和外部支付系统问题，弥合分布式系统中交易状态碎片化的可观测性差距。

Abstract: Instant payment infrastructures have stringent performance requirements,
processing millions of transactions daily with zero-downtime expectations.
Traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical
infrastructure metrics and business process visibility. We introduce a novel
feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between
consecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of
system state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early
failure detection and localization, allowing incident classification.
Experimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system,
using both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the
approach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides
inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the
business impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the
resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system
issues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability
gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across
multiple entities.

*Jinwoo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个模块化的一阶理论来预测Transformer在低精度训练时的前向误差放大问题，推导了自注意力层的稳定性边界，并提供了可操作的诊断指标和缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低精度训练的Transformer会遭受前向误差放大问题，需要理论工具来预测和缓解这种不稳定性。

Method: 开发了模块化的一阶理论，推导了自注意力层的稳定性边界，包含三个可解释的诊断指标：分数尺度比、行向softmax敏感度和值条件数，以及残差块和LayerNorm的分析。

Result: 在Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10上的实验表明，组合预测器能准确跟踪FP32与低精度之间的不匹配，softmax敏感度可作为早期预警信号，LayerNorm微调能稳定训练。

Conclusion: 该理论提供了可操作的诊断指标，能够解释自注意力的脆弱性、预测不稳定性，并指导最小侵入性的缓解措施。

Abstract: Transformers trained in low precision can suffer forward-error amplification.
We give a first-order, module-wise theory that predicts when and where errors
grow. For self-attention we derive a per-layer bound that factorizes into three
interpretable diagnostics: a score-scale ratio $\kappa_{\rm score}$, a rowwise
softmax sensitivity $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$, and value conditioning $\kappa(V)$.
We prove a residual relaxation inequality showing that residual blocks
attenuate depth-wise accumulation, and we introduce a precision- and
width-aware LayerNorm indicator $\rho_{\rm LN}$ with a matching first-order
bound in the $\epsilon$-dominated regime. These pieces yield a unified
forward-stability bound whose right-hand side is directly estimable during
training.
  On Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10 we evaluate the bound and components. (1) The combined
predictor $\kappa_{\rm softmax},(1+\kappa_{\rm
score}),\kappa(V),|W_O|2+\kappa{\rm eff}+C_{\rm LN}$ tracks
FP32$\leftrightarrow$LP mismatches across seeds, widths, and precisions;
scaling by $\epsilon_{\rm mach}$ collapses mixed-precision points. (2) The
time-series maximum of $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$ acts as an early-warning signal,
leading error spikes by 16-24 steps (corr. 0.65-0.82; permutation
$p!\approx!10^{-3}$; Precision@K 0.89-1.00). (3) Guided by $\rho_{\rm LN}$, a
small LayerNorm-$\epsilon$ tweak targeting $\rho_\star$ gives consistent
stabilization (mean tail-loss $\downarrow\ \approx0.010$ at $\rho_\star!=!0.6$,
cap$=10^{-2}$) with negligible overhead.
  Overall, our theory supplies actionable, unitless diagnostics that (i)
explain when self-attention is fragile, (ii) forecast instability, and (iii)
motivate a minimally invasive mitigation.

*Jinwoo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)方法，通过直接优化层谱来改善神经网络训练条件数，在对抗性设置下显著降低条件数并提升测试精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络训练中由于层条件数过大导致的梯度消失和训练不稳定问题，实现优化驱动的谱预处理。

Method: 使用CMR损失函数，通过log-condition代理联合控制谱边界，利用Chebyshev矩塑造内部谱分布，采用解耦的带帽混合规则保持任务梯度。

Result: 在MNIST数据集15层MLP的对抗性设置中，CMR将平均层条件数从约3900降低到约3.4（减少约10^3倍），增加平均梯度幅度，测试精度从约10%提升到约86%。

Conclusion: CMR证明了直接引导模型走向良好条件数区域的有效性，为稳定、准确的学习提供了优化驱动的谱预处理方法。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)}, a simple,
architecture-agnostic loss that directly optimizes layer spectra. CMR jointly
controls spectral edges via a log-condition proxy and shapes the interior via
Chebyshev moments, with a decoupled, capped mixing rule that preserves task
gradients. We prove strictly monotone descent for the condition proxy, bounded
moment gradients, and orthogonal invariance. In an adversarial
``$\kappa$-stress'' setting (MNIST, 15-layer MLP), \emph{compared to vanilla
training}, CMR reduces mean layer condition numbers by $\sim\!10^3$ (from
$\approx3.9\!\times\!10^3$ to $\approx3.4$ in 5 epochs), increases average
gradient magnitude, and restores test accuracy (
$\approx10\%\!\to\!\approx86\%$ ). These results support
\textbf{optimization-driven spectral preconditioning}: directly steering models
toward well-conditioned regimes for stable, accurate learning.

TL;DR: 开发机器学习模型预测术后误吸风险，识别阿片类药物剂量和手术部位为关键影响因素，发现男性患者误吸风险更高且阿片类药物剂量更大


<details>

Motivation: 误吸会显著影响手术患者的发病率和死亡率，需要开发预测模型以实现及时的预防性干预

Method: 从MIMIC-IV数据库中识别826例术后误吸患者和匹配对照组，使用XGBoost、多层感知机和随机森林三种机器学习模型，并采用增强逆概率加权估计平均处理效应

Result: 机器学习模型在测试集上达到AUROC 0.86和77.3%灵敏度，最大日阿片类药物剂量、住院时间和患者年龄是最重要预测因子，ATE分析显示阿片类药物和手术部位是显著因果因素

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能有效预测术后误吸风险，最大日阿片类药物剂量和手术部位显著影响误吸风险，性别差异在阿片类药物使用和误吸率方面值得进一步研究

Abstract: Background: Aspiration, the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs,
significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality. This study
develops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration,
enabling timely preventative interventions.
  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we
identified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\% male) who experienced
aspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration
cohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were
trained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative
aspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects
(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.
  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\% sensitivity on a
held-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age
emerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant
causative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/-
0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men
were 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\% higher maximum daily
opioid dosages compared to women.
  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk,
enabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and
operative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in
both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation.
These findings have important implications for improving postoperative care
protocols and aspiration prevention strategies.

Conclusion: 为组合多个专家以改善整体聚合模型性能提供了新方法和无遗憾保证。

Abstract: We explore the use of expert-guided bandit learning, which we refer to as
online mixture-of-experts (OMoE). In this setting, given a context, a candidate
committee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve
optimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to
address this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with
UCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration
actions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting
mechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional
to their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret
properties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical
results are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these
methods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language
models (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically
reweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to
generate the most accurate response. Our results introduce new methodologies
and no-regret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the
performance of the an aggregate model overall.

Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中存在预测误差，这些误差会随着采样步骤累积，从而降低生成质量。需要一种方法来测量和缓解这种误差。

Method: 提出方差减少引导(VRG)方法，在预定义采样轨迹的基础上搜索新的轨迹，保持相同采样步数但获得更高质量结果。适用于条件和非条件生成。

Result: 在多个数据集和基线模型上的实验表明，VRG能显著提升扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: VRG是一种有效减少扩散模型预测误差的方法，无需模型修改即可改善生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become emerging generative models. Their sampling
process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise
from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from
the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}.
The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates
generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically
measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance
(VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or
modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new
trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher
quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional
generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG
can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models. Source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MJO是全球天气和气候极端事件的重要驱动因素，但在操作动态模型中的预测仍然具有挑战性，有效预测通常仅限于3-4周。

Method: 两阶段模型：首先使用物理信息3D U-Net修正时空场误差，然后使用针对预测技能优化的LSTM精炼MJO的RMM指数。

Result: 应用于CMA、ECMWF和NCEP三个不同操作预报时，统一框架将有效预测范围（双变量相关>0.5）持续延长2-8天，有效缓解"海洋大陆障碍"。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一条物理一致、计算高效且高度可推广的途径，以突破次季节预测中长期存在的障碍。

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an important driver of global weather
and climate extremes, but its prediction in operational dynamical models
remains challenging, with skillful forecasts typically limited to 3-4 weeks.
Here, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, the Physics-guided Cascaded
Corrector for MJO (PCC-MJO), which acts as a universal post-processor to
correct MJO forecasts from dynamical models. This two-stage model first employs
a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct spatial-temporal field errors, then
refines the MJO's RMM index using an LSTM optimized for forecast skill. When
applied to three different operational forecasts from CMA, ECMWF and NCEP, our
unified framework consistently extends the skillful forecast range (bivariate
correlation > 0.5) by 2-8 days. Crucially, the model effectively mitigates the
"Maritime Continent barrier", enabling more realistic eastward propagation and
amplitude. Explainable AI analysis quantitatively confirms that the model's
decision-making is spatially congruent with observed MJO dynamics (correlation
> 0.93), demonstrating that it learns physically meaningful features rather
than statistical fittings. Our work provides a promising physically consistent,
computationally efficient, and highly generalizable pathway to break through
longstanding barriers in subseasonal forecasting.

Abstract: Current mainstream approaches to addressing multimodal imbalance primarily
focus on architectural modifications and optimization-based, often overlooking
a quantitative analysis of the imbalance degree between modalities. To address
this gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of
multi-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level
adaptive loss function.We begin by defining the "Modality Gap" as the
difference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and
visual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap
distribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively
to "modality-balanced" and "modality-imbalanced" data samples. Subsequently, we
apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample
belonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative
analysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1)
to minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample
distribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater
penalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy
consisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training
phase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets,
attaining accuracies of $80.65\%$ and $70.90\%$, respectively. This validates
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

Motivation: 矩阵预条件优化器（如Muon）在大规模神经网络训练中比标量优化器更高效，而方差缩减技术（如MARS）能显著加速LLM预训练。为了结合两者的优势，提出了MARS-M。

Method: 将MARS中的方差缩减技术与Muon优化器集成，形成新的MARS-M优化器。

Result: 理论证明MARS-M以$	ilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$的速率收敛到一阶驻点，优于Muon的$	ilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$速率。实证结果显示在语言建模和计算机视觉任务中，MARS-M能持续获得更低的损失和更好的下游基准性能。

Conclusion: MARS-M成功结合了矩阵预条件和方差缩减技术的优势，在理论和实证上都表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Matrix-based preconditioned optimizers, such as Muon, have recently been
shown to be more efficient than scalar-based optimizers for training
large-scale neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). On the
other hand, recent benchmarks on optimizers for LLM pre-training have
demonstrated that variance-reduction techniques such as MARS can achieve
substantial speedups over standard optimizers that do not employ variance
reduction. In this paper, to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce
MARS-M, a new optimizer that integrates the variance reduction technique in
MARS with Muon. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that Muon-M
converges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, which improves upon
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ rate attained by Muon. Our empirical results on
language modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M
consistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various
downstream benchmarks. The implementation of MARS-M is available at

TL;DR: XRePIT是一种新型混合仿真策略，将机器学习加速与基于求解器的校正相结合，实现了稳定、自动化的流体动力学模拟，在保持高物理保真度的同时获得高达4.98倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯数据驱动的流体动力学替代模型经常因误差累积而失败，而现有的混合方法缺乏自动化和鲁棒性，无法实际应用。

Method: 开发了XRePIT混合仿真策略，将机器学习加速与求解器校正协同结合，设计为完全自动化和物理感知的方法。

Result: 实现了首个稳定加速超过10,000个时间步的模拟，对未见边界条件具有鲁棒泛化能力，可扩展到3D流动，速度提升达4.98倍，热场相对误差约1E-3，低幅速度动态误差低于1E-2 ms-1。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一个成熟且可扩展的混合方法，为其在现实工程中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically
from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the
automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed
XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning
(ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our
method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and
practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that
this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable,
accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes
robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our
approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical
fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing
low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus
establishes a mature and scalable hybrid method, paving the way for its use in
real-world engineering.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种坐标无关的机场大雾短期预报模型，通过基于物理过程设计的特征集，实现了在不同地理位置间的零样本迁移预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机场大雾预报模型在地理泛化方面的挑战，因为许多机器学习模型依赖位置特定特征而无法跨站点迁移。

Method: 使用梯度提升分类器(XGBoost)，在圣地亚哥机场数据上训练，采用坐标无关的特征集编码基本热力学和辐射过程，并在其他三个机场进行零样本测试。

Result: 模型在距离达11,650公里的不同机场和不同雾类型下，AUC值达到0.923-0.947，SHAP特征分析显示能见度持续性、太阳角度和热梯度主导预测。

Conclusion: 基于物理过程的坐标无关特征工程可以产生地理可迁移的大气预报工具，模型学习的是可转移的物理关系而非站点特定模式。

Abstract: Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility < 1.0 km) presents
challenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models
rely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This
study investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes
can be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to
enable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost)
trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a
2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE),
San Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of
0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes
(radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that
visibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate
predictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships
rather than site-specific patterns. Results suggest that physics-informed,
coordinate-free feature engineering can yield geographically transferable
atmospheric forecasting tools.

TL;DR: 提出了HAIN（分层注意力可解释网络），一种结合多级注意力机制、降维和解释驱动损失函数的新架构，用于复杂生物医学数据的可解释分析，在TCGA数据集上达到94.3%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集在基因组学、医疗和金融领域的激增，迫切需要既准确又可解释的机器学习模型。传统深度学习方法缺乏透明度，阻碍了在关键决策应用中的部署。

Method: HAIN架构统一了多级注意力机制、维度缩减和解释驱动损失函数，通过梯度加权注意力提供特征级可解释性，通过原型表示提供全局模型解释。

Result: 在TCGA数据集上的综合评估显示，HAIN达到94.3%的分类准确率，在透明度和解释能力方面超越了SHAP和LIME等传统后处理可解释方法，并能有效识别生物学相关的癌症生物标志物。

Conclusion: HAIN通过协调预测准确性和可解释性，推进了精准医疗和监管合规的透明AI解决方案发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as genomics,
healthcare, and finance has created an urgent need for machine learning models
that are both highly accurate and inherently interpretable. While traditional
deep learning approaches deliver strong predictive performance, their lack of
transparency often impedes their deployment in critical, decision-sensitive
applications. In this work, we introduce the Hierarchical Attention-based
Interpretable Network (HAIN), a novel architecture that unifies multi-level
attention mechanisms, dimensionality reduction, and explanation-driven loss
functions to deliver interpretable and robust analysis of complex biomedical
data. HAIN provides feature-level interpretability via gradientweighted
attention and offers global model explanations through prototype-based
representations. Comprehensive evaluation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset demonstrates that HAIN achieves a classification accuracy of 94.3%,
surpassing conventional post-hoc interpretability approaches such as SHAP and
LIME in both transparency and explanatory power. Furthermore, HAIN effectively
identifies biologically relevant cancer biomarkers, supporting its utility for
clinical and research applications. By harmonizing predictive accuracy with
interpretability, HAIN advances the development of transparent AI solutions for
precision medicine and regulatory compliance.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多尺度Dubuc距离(MDD)与动态时间规整(DTW)在时间序列相似性度量上的比较，发现MDD在多尺度评估和避免点对点对齐方面具有优势，在多个场景下显著优于DTW。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列是高维复杂数据对象，其高效搜索和索引一直是数据挖掘领域的长期挑战。本文旨在探索新型相似性度量MDD相对于广泛使用的DTW的比较优势和局限性。

Method: 使用多尺度Dubuc距离(MDD)评估时间序列相似性，该方法在两个关键方面具有创新性：在多时间尺度上评估相似性，并避免点对点对齐。通过模拟实验和UCR档案库的95个数据集进行测试验证。

Result: 研究表明，在许多场景中MDD显著优于DTW，性能提升幅度很大。在具有挑战性的真实世界分类任务中，MDD相比DTW带来了显著改进。

Conclusion: MDD作为一种新型时间序列相似性度量方法，在多尺度评估和避免点对点对齐方面具有独特优势，在实际应用中展现出比DTW更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their
efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining. Building
on a recently introduced similarity measure, namely Multiscale Dubuc Distance
(MDD), this paper investigates its comparative strengths and limitations
relative to the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). MDD is novel in two key
ways: it evaluates time series similarity across multiple temporal scales and
avoids point-to-point alignment. We demonstrate that in many scenarios where
MDD outperforms DTW, the gains are substantial, and we provide a detailed
analysis of the specific performance gaps it addresses. We provide simulations,
in addition to the 95 datasets from the UCR archive, to test our hypotheses.
Finally, we apply both methods to a challenging real-world classification task
and show that MDD yields a significant improvement over DTW, underscoring its
practical utility.

TL;DR: 提出了GAPO方法，通过自适应寻找无异常值的高密度区间来替代组均值，解决代码编辑中奖励分布偏斜和异常值问题，在真实代码编辑任务中相比GRPO和DAPO取得一致改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界代码编辑场景中，奖励分布往往偏斜且包含不可预测的异常值，导致优势计算失真和噪声增加，现有方法如GRPO在处理这些问题时存在局限。

Method: GAPO自适应地为每个提示寻找无异常值的最高密度区间(HDI)，然后使用该区间中位数作为自适应Q值替代组均值进行优势计算，保持即插即用和高效率。

Result: 在9个指令调优的LLM(3B-14B)和包含51,844个真实世界代码编辑任务的大规模内部数据集上验证，相比GRPO及其变体DAPO在精确匹配准确率上取得一致改进。

Conclusion: GAPO能够鲁棒处理偏斜分布，在代码编辑任务中有效提升强化学习性能，且代码已公开。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language
models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are
popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in
real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with
unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and
increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy
Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density
interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an
adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q
robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and
efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a
large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks
across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match
accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO. Code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RestoreLCC方法，通过选择性补偿剪枝模型中丢失的注意力组件来恢复性能，同时保持模型的稀疏性和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法通常为密集模型设计，忽视了剪枝模型的特性，导致性能恢复效果不佳。剪枝引起的信息损失反映在注意力激活中，选择性恢复这些信息可以显著提升模型性能。

Method: RestoreLCC通过对比性探测关键注意力头、从激活差异中提取丢失组件，并将其注入回对应的剪枝头中进行补偿。该方法兼容结构化、半结构化和非结构化剪枝方案。

Result: 大量实验表明，RestoreLCC在通用和任务特定性能恢复方面均优于现有最优基线方法，且不损害剪枝模型的稀疏性或推理效率。

Conclusion: RestoreLCC是一种即插即用的方法，能够有效恢复剪枝LLM的性能，同时保持其低成本和高效率特性。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to reduce the size and inference cost of
large language models (LLMs), but it often causes performance degradation. To
mitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned
model's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models
and overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in
suboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy
for pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and
high efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected
in attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this
information can significantly recover model performance. Based on this insight,
we introduce RestoreLCC (Restoring Pruned LLMs via Lost Component
Compensation), a plug-and-play method that contrastively probes critical
attention heads via activation editing, extracts lost components from
activation differences, and finally injects them back into the corresponding
pruned heads for compensation and recovery. RestoreLCC is compatible with
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured pruning schemes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RestoreLCC consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both general and task-specific performance
recovery, without compromising the sparsity or inference efficiency of pruned
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一种考虑制度信任的强化学习算法，用于社区资源分配，发现在组织目标不确定时，纳入信任能产生更成功的政策，但组织成功与社区福祉之间存在张力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL工作假设公民会遵循政策，但现实中缺乏制度信任时公民不会配合政府政策，因此需要开发信任感知的算法来改善资源分配效果。

Method: 使用深度确定性策略梯度方法学习符合组织需求的资源分配策略，模拟资源分配过程并建模社区成员制度信任的变化，研究信任纳入对结果的影响。

Result: 纳入信任的RL算法能产生更成功的政策，特别是在组织目标不确定时；保守的信任估计能提高公平性和平均社区信任，但会降低组织成功率；外部配额干预在某些情况下能改善公平和信任。

Conclusion: 制度信任在算法设计和实施中至关重要，组织成功与社区福祉之间存在根本性张力，需要通过平衡策略来协调两者关系。

Abstract: Many governmental bodies are adopting AI policies for decision-making. In
particular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that
citizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that
citizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However,
we know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not
follow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a
trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider
the case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to
distribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits
the needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according
to the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of
community members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust
affects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if
trust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms
can lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's
goals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to
increased fairness and average community trust, though organization success
suffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to
communities. We implement a quota system by an external entity which decreases
the organization's utility when it does not serve enough community members. We
find this intervention can improve fairness and trust among communities in some
cases, while decreasing the success of the organization. This work underscores
the importance of institutional trust in algorithm design and implementation,
and identifies a tension between organization success and community well-being.

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的多任务系统，通过多任务学习和分层生成过程，从单张图像生成事实准确的商品描述，显著减少了事实幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动生成商品描述和名称对零售商来说劳动密集且耗时，现有视觉语言模型存在事实幻觉问题，单任务模型效率低且无法捕捉特征间的相互依赖关系。

Method: 1. 应用多任务学习方法微调视觉编码器，单一视觉主干网络联合训练属性预测（颜色、下摆、领型）和价格回归；2. 引入分层生成过程，将模型预测的属性嵌入提示中馈送到文本解码器以提高事实一致性。

Result: 多任务方法在价格回归上R2值提高3.6%，属性分类F1分数提高6.6%；分层生成过程将事实幻觉率从12.7%降至7.1%（相对减少44.5%），自回归文本生成延迟减少3.5倍。

Conclusion: 该架构在减少事实幻觉和提高效率方面表现优异，虽然ROUGE-L得分比直接视觉语言模型低3.5%，但整体性能显著提升。

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a
slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation
solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone
to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only
inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between
features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task
system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.
The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.
First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision
encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute
prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,
introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own
predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to
improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of
this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent
price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,
with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation
process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from
12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical
ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the
autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to
direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the
model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L
score.

Abstract: With the rise of online and virtual learning, monitoring and enhancing
student engagement have become an important aspect of effective education.
Traditional methods of assessing a student's involvement might not be
applicable directly to virtual environments. In this study, we focused on this
problem and addressed the need to develop an automated system to detect student
engagement levels during online learning. We proposed a novel training method
which can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for
its predictions. The proposed method offers benefits not only in the
enforcement of ethical standards, but also to enhance interpretability of the
model predictions. We applied an attribute-orthogonal regularization technique
to a split-model classifier, which uses multiple transfer learning strategies
to achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of
prediction for sensitivity groups from a Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.897 for the unmitigated model, to 0.999 for the mitigated model. The source

Motivation: 大语言模型由于计算资源成本高，不适合频繁重训练和持续学习。更新模型获取新知识会导致现有知识被覆盖，即灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 使用自编码器学习各任务权重的低维嵌入，促进知识向新任务迁移，同时防止灾难性遗忘，无需数据回放或大量任务特定参数。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实证评估表明，该方法不仅克服了灾难性遗忘，还显著减少了参数使用和内存大小，在多个任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: COLA框架使大语言模型能够高效学习新任务，对先前任务的性能下降很小，且无需保留早期训练数据，在持续学习方面表现出色。

Abstract: Learning a set of tasks over time, also known as continual learning (CL), is
one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence due to
catastrophic forgetting. Large language models (LLMs) are often impractical to
frequent re-training and continual learning , due to high cost of computational
resources for training. Moreover, LLM are not suitable for continual learning
as updating these models over time for acquiring new knowledge leads to
overwrites existing knowledge leading to common phenomenon know as
\textit{catastrophic forgetting}. In this paper, we aim to address these
concerns using a novel framework , COLA that employs an autoencoder to learn
capture low-dimensional embeddings of the weights associated with various
tasks. Our approach facilitates the transfer of knowledge to new tasks while
preventing catastrophic forgetting, all without using data replay or a
substantial set of task-specific parameters. Our approach, COLA, makes the LLM
efficiently learn new tasks with minimal training, insignificant performance
degradation on previous tasks, and eliminates the need for retaining earlier
training data. Empirical evaluation on different datasets ranging from task
oriented dialouge system to intent classsfication datasets showcases that our
method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting but also achieves significant
reduction in parameter usage and memory size, across multiple tasks and
outperforming the existing state of the art methods across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Identifying the factors that influence student performance in basic education
is a central challenge for formulating effective public policies in Brazil.
This study introduces a multi-level machine learning approach to classify the
proficiency of 9th-grade and high school students using microdata from the
System of Assessment of Basic Education (SAEB). Our model uniquely integrates
four data sources: student socioeconomic characteristics, teacher professional
profiles, school indicators, and director management profiles. A comparative
analysis of four ensemble algorithms confirmed the superiority of a Random
Forest model, which achieved 90.2% accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC)
of 96.7%. To move beyond prediction, we applied Explainable AI (XAI) using
SHAP, which revealed that the school's average socioeconomic level is the most
dominant predictor, demonstrating that systemic factors have a greater impact
than individual characteristics in isolation. The primary conclusion is that
academic performance is a systemic phenomenon deeply tied to the school's
ecosystem. This study provides a data-driven, interpretable tool to inform
policies aimed at promoting educational equity by addressing disparities
between schools.

TL;DR: KARIPAP是一种量子启发的张量网络压缩方法，使用无限投影纠缠对态(iPEPS)和张量重整化群(TRG)收缩来压缩大型语言模型，显著减少内存和参数，同时保持性能。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型的巨大参数量导致严重的计算和环境负担，现有压缩方法忽略了复杂的层间相关性，需要更有效的压缩技术。

Method: 使用iPEPS捕获注意力机制和深层transformer层中的多方向纠缠，通过TRG实现多项式时间收缩，进行张量化处理。

Result: 在LLaMA-2 7B上实现93%内存和70%参数减少，训练速度提升50%，推理速度提升25%，准确率仅损失2-3%。

Conclusion: 现代LLM占据低维纠缠流形，KARIPAP证明了量子感知AI架构的可扩展性和能效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA drive rapid progress in
generative AI, yet their huge parameter scales create severe computational and
environmental burdens. High training costs, energy use, and limited device
deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation,
low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer
correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression
using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor
Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS
captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer
layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible
while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to
93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster
inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling
reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor
factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional
entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware
AI architectures.

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展部署于国家机构和低带宽区域办公室，以透明可解释的方式提供近乎实时的财务困境预警，为加强家庭韧性和指导预防性干预策略提供可行见解。

Abstract: The growing instability of both global and domestic economic environments has
increased the risk of financial distress at the household level. However,
traditional econometric models often rely on delayed and aggregated data,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a machine learning-based
early warning system that utilizes real-time digital and macroeconomic signals
to identify financial distress in near real-time. Using a panel dataset of 750
households tracked over three monitoring rounds spanning 13 months, the
framework combines socioeconomic attributes, macroeconomic indicators (such as
GDP growth, inflation, and foreign exchange fluctuations), and digital economy
measures (including ICT demand and market volatility). Through data
preprocessing and feature engineering, we introduce lagged variables,
volatility measures, and interaction terms to capture both gradual and sudden
changes in financial stability. We benchmark baseline classifiers, such as
logistic regression and decision trees, against advanced ensemble models
including random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Our results indicate that the
engineered features from the digital economy significantly enhance predictive
accuracy. The system performs reliably for both binary distress detection and
multi-class severity classification, with SHAP-based explanations identifying
inflation volatility and ICT demand as key predictors. Crucially, the framework
is designed for scalable deployment in national agencies and low-bandwidth
regional offices, ensuring it is accessible for policymakers and practitioners.
By implementing machine learning in a transparent and interpretable manner,
this study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of providing near-real-time
early warnings of financial distress. This offers actionable insights that can
strengthen household resilience and guide preemptive intervention strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了GP-MIA，一种基于高斯过程元建模的高效可解释成员推理攻击方法，无需影子模型或大量查询访问，仅使用单个训练模型的指标就能区分训练集成员与非成员。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击方法通常依赖影子模型或大量查询访问，实用性受限，存在严重的隐私风险。

Method: 使用高斯过程元建模，基于单个训练模型的准确率、熵、数据集统计和可选敏感特征（如梯度、NTK度量）等后验指标，训练GP分类器来区分成员与非成员，并提供校准的不确定性估计。

Result: 在合成数据、真实世界欺诈检测数据、CIFAR-10和WikiText-2上的实验表明，GP-MIA实现了高准确率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: GP-MIA为现有成员推理攻击提供了实用的替代方案，具有高效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) test whether a data point was part of a
model's training set, posing serious privacy risks. Existing methods often
depend on shadow models or heavy query access, which limits their practicality.
We propose GP-MIA, an efficient and interpretable approach based on Gaussian
process (GP) meta-modeling. Using post-hoc metrics such as accuracy, entropy,
dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features (e.g. gradients, NTK
measures) from a single trained model, GP-MIA trains a GP classifier to
distinguish members from non-members while providing calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data,
CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2 show that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy and
generalizability, offering a practical alternative to existing MIAs.

*Mary E. An,Paul Griffin,Jonathan G. Stine,Ramakrishna Balakrishnan,Ram Sriram,Soundar Kumara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了MASER预测模型，使用LASSO逻辑回归预测代谢功能障碍相关脂肪肝病，在大型电子健康记录数据库中实现了0.836的AUROC和77.6%的准确率，并通过公平性后处理减少了种族和民族亚组间的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MASLD影响约33%的美国成年人，是最常见的慢性肝病。早期检测很重要，因为生活方式干预可以预防疾病进展。需要开发公平、严谨且可复现的预测模型。

Method: 评估了LASSO逻辑回归、随机森林、XGBoost和神经网络，使用临床特征子集（包括前10个SHAP排名特征）。应用了平等机会后处理方法以减少种族和民族亚组间的真阳性率差异。

Result: 训练数据59,492例，验证数据24,198例，测试数据25,188例。选择前10个特征的LASSO逻辑回归模型，公平性调整前AUROC为0.84，准确率78%；调整后准确率增至81%，特异性增至94%，但敏感性降至41%。

Conclusion: MASER预测模型在MASLD预测中实现了有竞争力的性能，与之前报告的集成和基于树的模型相当。可解释模型可以在不同患者群体中实现预测性能和公平性的平衡。

Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)
affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease.
Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection
is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We
developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and
compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and
a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including
the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates
across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity
postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in
the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic
regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability
and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved
AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and
F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly
increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and
F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk
Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive
performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to
previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach
demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive
performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.

*Kaiyi Xu,Junchao Gong,Wenlong Zhang,Ben Fei,Lei Bai,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出SynCast方法，首次将偏好优化引入降水临近预报，使用两阶段训练框架解决确定性模型过度平滑和概率模型性能波动的问题，协同优化冲突的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报面临确定性模型预测过度平滑难以捕捉极端事件，概率模型性能波动且难以在冲突指标上同时取得最优结果的问题。受大语言模型人类反馈强化学习的启发，引入偏好优化来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出SynCast方法，采用扩散序列偏好优化(Diffusion-SPO)的两阶段训练框架：第一阶段专注于降低误报率，第二阶段在保持误报率对齐的基础上进一步优化关键成功指数，实现冲突指标的协同改进。

Result: 该方法能够渐进式地对齐冲突的评估指标，在降水临近预报中持续实现优越性能，有效解决了关键成功指数和误报率之间的权衡问题。

Conclusion: 偏好优化是解决降水临近预报中冲突评估指标的有效方法，SynCast通过两阶段训练框架能够协同改进多个指标，为极端天气监测和灾害预防提供更可靠的预报支持。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting based on radar echoes plays a crucial role in
monitoring extreme weather and supporting disaster prevention. Although deep
learning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable
limitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed
predictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale
precipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent
randomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and
rarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation
nowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are
inherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the
Critical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it
challenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both
metrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference
optimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the
success of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.
Specifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage
post-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization
(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently
achieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on
reducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building
on this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints
that preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across
these conflicting metrics.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly adopted in high-stakes
decision-making domains, ensuring fairness in their outputs has become a
central challenge. At the core of fair ML research are the datasets used to
investigate bias and develop mitigation strategies. Yet, much of the existing
work relies on a narrow selection of datasets--often arbitrarily chosen,
inconsistently processed, and lacking in diversity--undermining the
generalizability and reproducibility of results.
  To address these limitations, we present FairGround: a unified framework,
data corpus, and Python package aimed at advancing reproducible research and
critical data studies in fair ML classification. FairGround currently comprises
44 tabular datasets, each annotated with rich fairness-relevant metadata. Our
accompanying Python package standardizes dataset loading, preprocessing,
transformation, and splitting, streamlining experimental workflows. By
providing a diverse and well-documented dataset corpus along with robust
tooling, FairGround enables the development of fairer, more reliable, and more

TL;DR: 提出一个混合整数规划框架，用于优化医疗风险评分工具，解决部分监督和不对称误分类成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录数据为优化风险评分工具提供了机会，但面临两个挑战：干预审查结果导致的部分监督问题，以及随着序数距离增加的不对称误分类成本。

Method: 使用混合整数编程框架联合优化评分权重和类别阈值，通过每个实例的可行标签集处理部分监督，采用不对称距离感知目标，并通过最小阈值间隙防止中间类别崩溃。

Result: 开发了使用softplus损失的CSO松弛方法，在保持序数结构的同时实现高效优化。

Conclusion: 该框架支持治理约束，包括符号限制、稀疏性和对现有工具的最小修改，确保在临床工作流程中的实际可部署性。

Abstract: Risk assessment tools in healthcare commonly employ point-based scoring
systems that map patients to ordinal risk categories via thresholds. While
electronic health record (EHR) data presents opportunities for data-driven
optimization of these tools, two fundamental challenges impede standard
supervised learning: (1) partial supervision arising from intervention-censored
outcomes, where only extreme categories can be reliably labeled, and (2)
asymmetric misclassification costs that increase with ordinal distance. We
propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that jointly optimizes
scoring weights and category thresholds under these constraints. Our approach
handles partial supervision through per-instance feasible label sets,
incorporates asymmetric distance-aware objectives, and prevents middle-category
collapse via minimum threshold gaps. We further develop a CSO relaxation using
softplus losses that preserves the ordinal structure while enabling efficient
optimization. The framework supports governance constraints including sign
restrictions, sparsity, and minimal modifications to incumbent tools, ensuring
practical deployability in clinical workflows.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型大多以英语为中心设计，限制了其在多语言环境中的有效性。本研究旨在通过分析多语言设计选择的影响，开发更有效的多语言视觉语言模型。

Method: 分析了多种多语言设计选择，包括训练数据组成、编码器选择和文本主干。基于多语言文本模型Tower+构建TowerVision模型家族，并发布了高质量视觉语言数据集VisionBlocks。

Result: TowerVision在多个多模态多语言基准测试中取得竞争性表现，在ALM-Bench、Multi30K和ViMUL-Bench等任务上超越了基于更大数据集训练的方法。多语言视觉语言训练数据显著改善了跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言训练数据对跨语言泛化至关重要，指令调优的LLM并不总是最优初始化点。研究公开了所有模型、数据和训练方法以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing
work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in
multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study
analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training
data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is
TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and
video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+.
TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal
multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded
tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context
during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on
substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image
tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release
VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings
highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially
improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to
underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs
are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research,
we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.

Abstract: Novelty detection in large scientific datasets faces two key challenges: the
noisy and high-dimensional nature of experimental data, and the necessity of
making statistically robust statements about any observed outliers. While there
is a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction,
most methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of
scientific discovery. In this work we directly address these challenges,
presenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection
adapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science. We introduce
AutoSciDACT (Automated Scientific Discovery with Anomalous Contrastive
Testing), a general-purpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data.
AutoSciDACT begins by creating expressive low-dimensional data representations
using a contrastive pre-training, leveraging the abundance of high-quality
simulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide
principled data augmentation strategies. These compact embeddings then enable
an extremely sensitive machine learning-based two-sample test using the New
Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) framework, which identifies and statistically
quantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution
(null hypothesis). We perform experiments across a range of astronomical,
physical, biological, image, and synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong
sensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains.

Motivation: 传统DEIM方法虽然能有效近似非线性项，但其固定的插值点限制了在复杂时变动力系统中的适应性，需要开发更灵活的方法。

Method: 开发了可微分自适应DEIM公式，让神经网络动态选择插值点；并将DEIM作为分析工具来检查预训练NODE模型的学习动态。

Result: 在一维粘性Burgers方程中实现了计算高效且物理一致的自适应插值点选择；在二维涡旋合并问题中，DEIM轨迹揭示了NODE学习动态的物理意义特征，并暴露了其在未见流配置外推时的局限性。

Conclusion: DEIM不仅可以作为模型降阶工具，还能作为诊断框架来理解和改进神经微分方程模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical
Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical
system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in
projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points
limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this
limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the
one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to
dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and
physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis
tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The
DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics
of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow
configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a
model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and
improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.

Abstract: Decision-making for multi-energy system (MES) dispatch depends on accurate
load forecasting. Traditionally, load forecasting and decision-making for MES
are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to
minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream
decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been
studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption
of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing
sensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising
serious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL
framework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to
safeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and
gradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we
design a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic
encryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.
Additionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition
algorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous
load patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including
real-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy
but also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to
existing methods.

Abstract: Spectral decomposition of linear operators plays a central role in many areas
of machine learning and scientific computing. Recent work has explored training
neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling
scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical
optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the
\emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for
solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple
linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal
connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared
independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its
broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to
train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and
demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our
results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens
of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for
deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and
scalable tools for machine learning.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of deep learning, applying such techniques to EM
methods has emerged as a promising research direction to overcome the
limitations of conventional approaches. The effectiveness of deep learning
methods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences
model performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies
often construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple
three-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real
geological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly
available three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress
in deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present
OpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset
that encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.
OpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple
configurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures
such as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their
corresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward
modeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed
a deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling
efficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This
capability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.
OpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM
exploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in
electromagnetic methods. The complete dataset, along with the forward modeling
codes and trained models, is publicly available at

Motivation: 传统Jump Gaussian Processes在高维输入空间中存在局限性，需要一种能够有效处理高维分段连续函数的方法。

Method: 在Jump Gaussian Processes基础上添加局部线性投影层，使用区域特定矩阵捕捉局部子空间结构，并通过高斯过程先验控制模型复杂度，构建双层深度GP/JGP学习框架。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，DJGP相比现有方法具有更优的预测精度和更可靠的不确定性量化能力。

Conclusion: DJGP方法成功克服了传统方法在高维空间中的限制，为高维分段连续函数的代理建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP), a novel method for
surrogate modeling of high-dimensional piecewise continuous functions. DJGP
overcomes the limitations of conventional Jump Gaussian Processes in
high-dimensional input spaces by adding a locally linear projection layer to
Jump Gaussian Processes. This projection uses region-specific matrices to
capture local subspace structures, naturally complementing the localized nature
of JGP, a variant of local Gaussian Processes. To control model complexity, we
place a Gaussian Process prior on the projection matrices, allowing them to
evolve smoothly across the input space. The projected inputs are then modeled
with a JGP to capture piecewise continuous relationships with the response.
This yields a distinctive two-layer deep learning of GP/JGP. We further develop
a scalable variational inference algorithm to jointly learn the projection
matrices and JGP hyperparameters. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DJGP delivers superior predictive accuracy and more
reliable uncertainty quantification compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 测试大语言模型在无外部反馈的递归自我评估中是否真正能够进行反思性推理，还是仅仅产生重新表述而非实质性进展。

Method: 跨提供商研究，使用三个模型（GPT-4o-mini、Claude 3 Haiku、Gemini 2.0 Flash）和四类任务（算术、代码、解释、反思），每种任务迭代十次，比较无基础自我批评和最小基础干预两种条件。

Conclusion: 生成式推理中的自校正存在结构性限制，没有独立验证者或环境的信息交换，递归推理会趋于认知静止状态。最小基础干预作为耗散耦合重新引入信息流动。

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,
yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields
reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider
study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,
Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families
(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two
conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a
single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta
I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to
late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all
three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change
immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.
Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level
entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward
informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on
self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information
with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an
attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative
coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency
suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives
rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when
reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles
for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

Conclusion: 该热力学参数化的ERGM嵌入方法能够有效处理实验偏差，为识别低丰度适配体候选物提供可靠工具，有望用于进一步的实验评估。

Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as
graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure
predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free
energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative
of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically
parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models
molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate
this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR
amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity,
producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their
actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust
community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand
affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be
used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental
evaluation.

Abstract: This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development
of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations
arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a
forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data
distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate
distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise
back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three
complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational
autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The
score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the
evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely
regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation
as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a
learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a
time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.
Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise
into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph
discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,
and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between
arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded
understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning
knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战强化学习领域的传统观念：时序差分方法被认为是实现经验拼接的唯一途径，而蒙特卡洛方法被认为无法重组经验。研究在函数逼近设置下这些传统观点是否成立。

Method: 通过实证研究比较蒙特卡洛方法和时序差分方法在函数逼近设置下的表现，特别关注神经网络容量对经验拼接能力的影响。

Result: 发现蒙特卡洛方法也能实现经验拼接，时序差分方法虽然表现略好，但两者差距远小于不同容量神经网络之间的差距。增加批评者网络容量能有效减少两种方法的泛化差距。

Conclusion: 传统时序差分方法对拼接的归纳偏置在大模型时代可能不再必要，拼接这种强化学习特有的泛化形式可以通过模型规模而非专门算法实现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to solve long-horizon tasks even when
training data contains only short fragments of the behaviors. This experience
stitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)
methods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never
intersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common
belief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine
experience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result
in a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study
whether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings
where function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte
Carlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do
achieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with
conventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between
small and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that
increasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both
the MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive
bias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,
in some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest
that stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be
achieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but
rather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other
machine learning settings (via scale). Project website:

Abstract: The performance of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms
generally depends on data representation. That is why, much of the current
effort in performing machine learning algorithms goes into the design of
preprocessing frameworks and data transformations able to support effective
machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear
feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification
problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse
linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased
discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying
criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods.
The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to
select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the
row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear
transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative
alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and
different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the
sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant
embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets
including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to
outperform competing methods in most cases.

Result: 理论分析表明黑盒和概念预测器通常不具备因果可解释性，提出的框架能够构建因果可解释模型，实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 因果可解释性与预测准确性存在根本性权衡，通过识别最优特征集可以在保持模型表达能力的同时实现因果可解释性。

Abstract: Understanding the predictions made by deep learning models remains a central
challenge, especially in high-stakes applications. A promising approach is to
equip models with the ability to answer counterfactual questions --
hypothetical ``what if?'' scenarios that go beyond the observed data and
provide insight into a model reasoning. In this work, we introduce the notion
of causal interpretability, which formalizes when counterfactual queries can be
evaluated from a specific class of models and observational data. We analyze
two common model classes -- blackbox and concept-based predictors -- and show
that neither is causally interpretable in general. To address this gap, we
develop a framework for building models that are causally interpretable by
design. Specifically, we derive a complete graphical criterion that determines
whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query. This
leads to a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive
accuracy, which we characterize by identifying the unique maximal set of
features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive
expressiveness. Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 提出Adversarial Déjà Vu假设，认为新的越狱攻击本质上是先前对抗技能的重新组合，并基于此开发了Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT)方法，通过训练对抗技能组合而非孤立攻击实例来提升对未见越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Motivation: 大型语言模型仍然容易受到越狱攻击，现有对抗训练方法由于优化挑战和威胁模型定义困难，在实践中往往无法防御新开发的越狱攻击。

Method: 通过大规模分析32篇攻击论文，提取并压缩对抗技能为稀疏基元字典，然后提出ASCoT方法，训练模型处理技能基元的多样化组合而非孤立攻击实例。

Result: ASCoT显著提高了对未见攻击（包括多轮越狱）的鲁棒性，同时保持较低的过度拒绝率，证明扩展对抗技能覆盖范围而非仅增加数据规模是防御新攻击的关键。

Conclusion: 基于Adversarial Déjà Vu假设的ASCoT方法为防御未见越狱攻击提供了新的有效范式，强调对抗技能组合训练的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Defending against novel jailbreaks
represents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed
to make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant
paradigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges
and difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training
methods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper
proposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,
centered on the Adversarial D\'ej\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not
fundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from
previous attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32
attack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract
and compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with
LLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen
attacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,
with explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided
by this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),
which trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated
attack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,
including multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We
also demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data
scale, is key to defending against novel attacks.

Motivation: 现有文本水印方法假设完美的伪随机性，但实际中生成文本的重复会导致碰撞和结构依赖，这会损害I类错误控制并使标准分析无效。

Method: 引入分层两阶段划分的统计框架，核心是最小单元概念——跨单元独立但允许单元内依赖的最小分组。使用最小单元定义非渐近效率度量，将水印检测建模为极小极大假设检验问题。

Result: 应用于Gumbel-max和逆变换水印时，该框架产生闭式最优规则。理论和实验都证实了在严格I类错误控制下检测能力的提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为不完美伪随机性下的水印检测提供了首个原则性基础，为模型输出的可靠追踪提供了理论洞见和实践指导。

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and
accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse.
While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In
practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create
structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating
standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a
hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units
-- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting
dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency
measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework
produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated
statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence
must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm
improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results
provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect
pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for
reliable tracing of model outputs.

Method: 定义加权准确率(WA)作为线性组合的评估指标，建立处理类别不平衡的成本敏感框架，提出在缺乏完整成本信息时估计WA权重参数的方法。

Result: WA与TCC在示例依赖场景中具有强相关性，证明了其鲁棒性。该框架可用于比较不同数据集的结果，并解决开发数据集与目标数据集之间的差异。

Conclusion: WA是一个直观且与TCC最小化目标一致的评估指标，澄清了类别再平衡技术的适用场景，为成本敏感分类提供了实用的评估框架。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate evaluation metric for classifiers is crucial for
model comparison and parameter optimization, yet there is not consensus on a
universally accepted metric that serves as a definitive standard. Moreover,
there is often a misconception about the perceived need to mitigate imbalance
in datasets used to train classification models. Since the final goal in
classifier optimization is typically maximizing the return of investment or,
equivalently, minimizing the Total Classification Cost (TCC), we define
Weighted Accuracy (WA), an evaluation metric for binary classifiers with a
straightforward interpretation as a weighted version of the well-known accuracy
metric, coherent with the need of minimizing TCC. We clarify the conceptual
framework for handling class imbalance in cost-sensitive scenarios, providing
an alternative to rebalancing techniques. This framework can be applied to any
metric that, like WA, can be expressed as a linear combination of
example-dependent quantities and allows for comparing the results obtained in
different datasets and for addressing discrepancies between the development
dataset, used to train and validate the model, and the target dataset, where
the model will be deployed. It also specifies in which scenarios using
UCCs-unaware class rebalancing techniques or rebalancing metrics aligns with
TCC minimization and when it is instead counterproductive. Finally, we propose
a procedure to estimate the WA weight parameter in the absence of fully
specified UCCs and demonstrate the robustness of WA by analyzing its
correlation with TCC in example-dependent scenarios.

Abstract: Neural networks are parametric and powerful tools for function approximation,
and the choice of architecture heavily influences their interpretability,
efficiency, and generalization. In contrast, Gaussian processes (GPs) are
nonparametric probabilistic models that define distributions over functions
using a kernel to capture correlations among data points. However, these models
become computationally expensive for large-scale problems, as they require
inverting a large covariance matrix. Kolmogorov- Arnold networks (KANs),
semi-parametric neural architectures, have emerged as a prominent approach for
modeling complex functions with structured and efficient representations
through spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend this
idea by reducing the number of spline layers in KAN and replacing them with
Chebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, thereby mapping inputs into
higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations.
Compared to KANs, KKANs perform more stable convergence during training, making
them a strong architecture for estimating operators and system modeling in
dynamical systems. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel
learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks
(K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with
uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that
are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to
its nearest training points. Through case studies on a safe control task, we
demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times higher
computationally efficiency than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than
GP by increasing the data size, and 50% safer than our previous work
distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近文献观察到神经网络存在瓶颈秩特性：随着深度增加，基于梯度方法训练的神经网络激活和权重趋于近似低秩。本文旨在研究这一现象对泛化的影响。

Method: 通过分析权重矩阵的Schatten p拟范数，推导出利用神经网络近似低秩结构的泛化界。当p较小时，界表现出与权重矩阵秩相关的样本复杂度。

Result: 证明了泛化界依赖于权重矩阵的Schatten p拟范数。对于小的p，样本复杂度为O(WrL^2)，其中W和L分别是网络的宽度和深度，r是权重矩阵的秩。随着p增大，界的行为更类似于基于范数的界。

Conclusion: 神经网络中的瓶颈秩现象可以用于推导改进的泛化界，当权重矩阵具有低秩结构时，能够获得更好的样本复杂度。

Abstract: It has been recently observed in much of the literature that neural networks
exhibit a bottleneck rank property: for larger depths, the activation and
weights of neural networks trained with gradient-based methods tend to be of
approximately low rank. In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer
converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the
minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in
line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without
activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$
quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications
of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove
generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low
rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the
Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds
exhibit a sample complexity $ \widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the
width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of
the weight matrices. As $p$ increases, the bound behaves more like a norm-based
bound instead.

Abstract: We study the problem of Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL), where the
goal is to learn a reward-maximizing policy from fixed data under a cumulative
cost constraint. We propose a novel OSRL approach that frames the problem as a
minimax objective and solves it by combining offline RL with online
optimization algorithms. We prove the approximate optimality of this approach
when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online
optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined
with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy
evaluation. Empirical results on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that our method
reliably enforces safety constraints under stringent cost budgets, while
achieving high rewards. The code is available at

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial
intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions,
and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be
broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches.
Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered
by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization
but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work
explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores,
obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the
implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based
optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes,
surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a
real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the
extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$
tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of
$O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during
both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is
the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear
time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to
regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical
efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes,
along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6
times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end
settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates
similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非平稳连续平均场博弈的深度强化学习算法，结合虚拟博弈、条件归一化流和深度强化学习来解决大规模多智能体系统中的复杂问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的平均场博弈强化学习方法通常局限于有限空间或平稳模型，难以应用于现实世界问题，需要开发能够处理非平稳连续空间的方法。

Method: 基于虚拟博弈框架，使用深度强化学习计算最优响应，监督学习表示平均策略，并采用条件归一化流学习时间相关的种群分布表示。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的示例上验证了方法的有效性，解决了可扩展性和密度逼近的关键限制。

Conclusion: 这项工作在将深度强化学习技术应用于复杂平均场博弈问题方面取得了重要进展，使该领域更接近现实世界的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling
interactions in large-scale multi-agent systems. Despite recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to
finite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world
problems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The
proposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging
DRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy
representation. Furthermore, it learns a representation of the time-dependent
population distribution using a Conditional Normalizing Flow. To validate the
effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three different examples of
increasing complexity. By addressing critical limitations in scalability and
density approximation, this work represents a significant advancement in
applying DRL techniques to complex MFG problems, bringing the field closer to
real-world multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)框架，将单细胞技术生成的不规则点云嵌入到固定维度的欧几里得空间，同时保留分布结构，实现可解释的分类和合成数据生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞技术生成高维细胞点云，但每个患者由不规则点云表示，难以直接量化和比较个体间的生物学差异。非线性方法如核方法和神经网络虽然预测准确，但缺乏生物可解释性。

Method: 采用Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)框架，将不规则点云嵌入到固定维度的欧几里得空间，保留最优传输几何结构，形成可解释的线性表示。

Result: LOT实现了：(i) COVID-19患者状态的可解释分类，分类器权重可映射回特定标记和空间区域；(ii) 患者来源类器官的合成数据生成，利用LOT嵌入的线性特性生成平均细胞谱。

Conclusion: LOT作为一个统一框架，桥接了预测性能、可解释性和生成建模，通过将异质点云转换为可追溯原始数据的结构化嵌入，为理解免疫变异和治疗效果开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells,
enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment
responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather
than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare
biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels
and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes,
offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)
framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a
fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure.
This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves
optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a
registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their
cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate
and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier
weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions;
and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids,
exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged
cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug
interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges
predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By
transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly
traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding
immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PUNT是一种模型无关的采样器，通过识别token依赖关系并移除低置信度token，实现并行采样，在准确性和计算效率之间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型（MDMs）相比自回归模型（ARMs）具有并行采样的优势，但并行采样面临两个冲突需求：同时更新的token必须条件独立，而更新应优先考虑高置信度预测。高置信度预测往往相互依赖，限制了并行更新的机会。

Method: PUNT通过识别token依赖关系，从冲突组中移除低置信度token，生成满足独立性和置信度标准的索引集，通过近似条件独立性测试确保改进的并行解掩码。

Result: 在IFEval基准测试中，PUNT相比基线方法（包括顺序生成）实现了高达16%的准确率提升，尤其在生成长序列时表现更优，且对超参数不敏感。

Conclusion: PUNT在准确性和计算效率之间提供了优越的权衡，并诱导出层次化生成策略，模型先建立高级段落结构再进行局部细化，表现出类似规划的生成过程，有助于强对齐性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable
parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This
means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling
faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be
conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence
predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often
cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our
method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from
conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy
both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved
parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy
and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially
for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to
16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation
(one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters,
mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe
that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model
first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement,
suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong
alignment performance.

Abstract: The classic Mallows model is a foundational tool for modeling user
preferences. However, it has limitations in capturing real-world scenarios,
where users often focus only on a limited set of preferred items and are
indifferent to the rest. To address this, extensions such as the top-k Mallows
model have been proposed, aligning better with practical applications. In this
paper, we address several challenges related to the generalized top-k Mallows
model, with a focus on analyzing buyer choices. Our key contributions are: (1)
a novel sampling scheme tailored to generalized top-k Mallows models, (2) an
efficient algorithm for computing choice probabilities under this model, and
(3) an active learning algorithm for estimating the model parameters from
observed choice data. These contributions provide new tools for analysis and
prediction in critical decision-making scenarios. We present a rigorous
mathematical analysis for the performance of our algorithms. Furthermore,
through extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, we
demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our proposed methods, and we
compare the predictive power of Mallows model for top-k lists compared to the
simpler Multinomial Logit model.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理非凸约束集时依赖昂贵的投影步骤，且无法同时处理等式和不等式约束，缺乏严格的收敛保证。

Method: 引入Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA)框架，设计过阻尼Langevin动力学，沿约束曲面法向确定性修正轨迹，无需显式投影。

Result: 在目标密度和约束集满足适当正则条件下，OLLA在W2距离上以指数速度收敛到约束目标密度。

Conclusion: OLLA相比基于投影的约束Langevin算法及其松弛变量变体，具有更优的计算效率和合理的经验混合性能。

Abstract: Sampling from constrained statistical distributions is a fundamental task in
various fields including Bayesian statistics, computational chemistry, and
statistical physics. This article considers the cases where the constrained
distribution is described by an unconstrained density, as well as additional
equality and/or inequality constraints, which often make the constraint set
nonconvex. Existing methods for nonconvex constraint set $\Sigma \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by equality or inequality constraints commonly rely on
costly projection steps. Moreover, they cannot handle equality and inequality
constraints simultaneously as each method only specialized in one case. In
addition, rigorous and quantitative convergence guarantee is often lacking. In
this paper, we introduce Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA), a new
framework that can design overdamped Langevin dynamics accommodating both
equality and inequality constraints. The proposed dynamics also
deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the
constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. We show
that, under suitable regularity conditions on the target density and $\Sigma$,
OLLA converges exponentially fast in $W_2$ distance to the constrained target
density $\rho_\Sigma(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))d\sigma_\Sigma$. Lastly, through
experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of OLLA compared to projection-based
constrained Langevin algorithms and their slack variable variants, highlighting
its favorable computational cost and reasonable empirical mixing.

Motivation: RLVR训练会导致模型能力退化，现有正则化方法无法保证广泛知识保留，经验回放难以平衡不同目标的训练重点

Method: RECAP回放策略，使用收敛和不稳定性信号动态调整目标权重，将训练焦点从饱和目标转向表现不佳或波动的目标

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL模型上的实验证明该方法有效保持通用能力，同时通过更灵活的任务奖励权衡提升推理性能

Conclusion: RECAP是端到端方法，无需额外模型或大量调参即可应用于现有RLVR流程，解决了能力退化问题

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has delivered
impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a
standard post-training paradigm for contemporary language and vision-language
models. However, the RLVR recipe introduces a significant risk of capability
regression, where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training
without employing regularization strategies. We empirically confirm this
concern, observing that open-source reasoning models suffer performance
degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness. While
imposing regularization terms like KL divergence can help prevent deviation
from the base model, these terms are calculated on the current task, thus they
do not guarantee broader knowledge. Meanwhile, commonly used experience replay
across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training
focus each objective should receive. To address this, we propose RECAP-a replay
strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation.
Our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using short-horizon
signals of convergence and instability, shifting the post-training focus away
from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones. Our
method is end-to-end and readily applicable to existing RLVR pipelines without
training additional models or heavy tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmarks
based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves
reasoning by enabling more flexible trade-offs among in-task rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有函数对函数回归方法（如函数线性模型和神经算子）要么无法捕捉复杂非线性关系，要么在噪声、稀疏和不规则采样数据下缺乏可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 设计了一系列基于GP的线性和非线性变换，利用核的积分变换、GP插值和从GP采样的非线性激活函数。通过固定位置下的离散近似简化实现，并使用诱导点和白化变换开发变分学习算法。

Result: 在真实世界和PDE基准数据集上的实验结果表明，DGPFM在预测性能和不确定性校准方面具有优势。

Conclusion: DGPFM方法有效解决了函数空间映射学习中的非线性建模和不确定性量化问题，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Learning mappings between functional spaces, also known as
function-on-function regression, plays a crucial role in functional data
analysis and has broad applications, e.g. spatiotemporal forecasting, curve
prediction, and climate modeling. Existing approaches, such as functional
linear models and neural operators, either fall short of capturing complex
nonlinearities or lack reliable uncertainty quantification under noisy, sparse,
and irregularly sampled data. To address these issues, we propose Deep Gaussian
Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM). Our method designs a sequence of
GP-based linear and nonlinear transformations, leveraging integral transforms
of kernels, GP interpolation, and nonlinear activations sampled from GPs. A key
insight simplifies implementation: under fixed locations, discrete
approximations of kernel integral transforms collapse into direct functional
integral transforms, enabling flexible incorporation of various integral
transform designs. To achieve scalable probabilistic inference, we use inducing
points and whitening transformations to develop a variational learning
algorithm. Empirical results on real-world and PDE benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the advantage of DGPFM in both predictive performance and
uncertainty calibration.

Result: NIP在异构预算严格约束下实现接近最优性能，达到oracle策略的95%，并能扩展到数百个臂。

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂资源受限环境中的索引策略学习建立了通用、理论基础扎实且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) provide a scalable framework for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical formulations assume
binary actions and a single global budget. Real-world settings, such as
healthcare, often involve multiple interventions with heterogeneous costs and
constraints, where such assumptions break down. We introduce a Neural Index
Policy (NIP) for multi-action RMABs with heterogeneous budget constraints. Our
approach learns to assign budget-aware indices to arm--action pairs using a
neural network, and converts them into feasible allocations via a
differentiable knapsack layer formulated as an entropy-regularized optimal
transport (OT) problem. The resulting model unifies index prediction and
constrained optimization in a single end-to-end differentiable framework,
enabling gradient-based training directly on decision quality. The network is
optimized to align its induced occupancy measure with the theoretical upper
bound from a linear programming relaxation, bridging asymptotic RMAB theory
with practical learning. Empirically, NIP achieves near-optimal performance
within 5% of the oracle occupancy-measure policy while strictly enforcing
heterogeneous budgets and scaling to hundreds of arms. This work establishes a
general, theoretically grounded, and scalable framework for learning
index-based policies in complex resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation
learning, but its direct applicability to challenging fields like medical
imaging remains limited: mere generation, without task alignment, fails to
provide a robust foundation for clinical use. We propose MAGIC-Flow, a
conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation
and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a
hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian
determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures
exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility
enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an
interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels,
MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled
class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and
discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using
metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it
addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and
modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates
realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an
effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains,
with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust
generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子去噪方法依赖于过度简化的分子动力学假设，认为原子运动是各向同性和同方差性的，这限制了模型对复杂分子系统的建模能力。

Method: 提出结构感知的各向异性噪声生成器，能够产生原子特定的全协方差矩阵用于高斯噪声分布，这些协方差来自原子间相互作用作为各向同性基础的各向异性修正。

Conclusion: AniDS能够自适应地抑制键合方向的噪声，与物理化学原理一致，为3D分子预训练提供了更准确的去噪框架。

Abstract: Coordinate denoising has emerged as a promising method for 3D molecular
pretraining due to its theoretical connection to learning molecular force
field. However, existing denoising methods rely on oversimplied molecular
dynamics that assume atomic motions to be isotropic and homoscedastic. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel denoising framework AniDS:
Anisotropic Variational Autoencoder for 3D Molecular Denoising. AniDS
introduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce
atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to
better reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems.
These covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic
corrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting
covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and
SO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular
dynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and
homoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22
benchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force
prediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows
that AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent
with physicochemical principles. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控节点状态需要平衡查询成本和预测准确性，因为频繁查询成本高，而仅依赖预测可能不准确。需要智能决定何时查询。

Method: 使用贪婪策略：当预期预测损失低于查询成本时预测，否则查询。在未知转移概率情况下，提出基于投影随机梯度下降的学习变体。

Result: 贪婪策略在一般情况下可能次优且竞争比无界，但在常见条件下（如相同分布转移概率）接近最优。学习变体在计算效率上优于最优策略。

Conclusion: 贪婪策略及其学习变体在节点状态监控问题中提供了有效的查询-预测权衡方案，在常见条件下性能接近最优且计算效率更高。

Abstract: We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The
monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed
cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using
time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models
(TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query
decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is
nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the
expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We
analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is
a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query
cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is
suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common
conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it
performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we
further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning
variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff
with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型可解释性研究主要依赖代理模块进行特征发现，但缺乏对这些学习特征与原始模型参数特征的系统性比较。

Method: 从FF层作为键值记忆的角度，使用现代可解释性基准重新评估FF层中存储的特征向量，并与SAE学习特征进行对比。

Result: SAE和FF展现出相似的可解释性范围，SAE在某些方面有微小改进，但在某些方面FF甚至表现更好，且两者发现的特征存在分歧。

Conclusion: SAE相比直接解释FF特征向量的优势受到质疑，FF键值参数应作为现代可解释性研究的强基线。

Abstract: Recent interpretability work on large language models (LLMs) has been
increasingly dominated by a feature-discovery approach with the help of proxy
modules. Then, the quality of features learned by, e.g., sparse auto-encoders
(SAEs), is evaluated. This paradigm naturally raises a critical question: do
such learned features have better properties than those already represented
within the original model parameters, and unfortunately, only a few studies
have made such comparisons systematically so far. In this work, we revisit the
interpretability of feature vectors stored in feed-forward (FF) layers, given
the perspective of FF as key-value memories, with modern interpretability
benchmarks. Our extensive evaluation revealed that SAE and FFs exhibits a
similar range of interpretability, although SAEs displayed an observable but
minimal improvement in some aspects. Furthermore, in certain aspects,
surprisingly, even vanilla FFs yielded better interpretability than the SAEs,
and features discovered in SAEs and FFs diverged. These bring questions about
the advantage of SAEs from both perspectives of feature quality and
faithfulness, compared to directly interpreting FF feature vectors, and FF
key-value parameters serve as a strong baseline in modern interpretability
research.

Abstract: Computationally predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is challenging
due to the lack of integrated, multimodal protein representations. DPEB is a
curated collection of 22,043 human proteins that integrates four embedding
types: structural (AlphaFold2), transformer-based sequence (BioEmbeddings),
contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling), and
sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are
available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure
Database), but the internal neural network embeddings are not. DPEB addresses
this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling.
Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest
PPI prediction performance (87.37% AUROC, 79.16% accuracy). The framework also
achieved 77.42% accuracy for enzyme classification and 86.04% accuracy for
protein family classification. DPEB supports multiple graph neural network
methods for PPI prediction, enabling applications in systems biology, drug
target identification, pathway analysis, and disease mechanism studies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种四步部分贝叶斯框架，用于本构模型发现中的不确定性量化，无需材料参数先验选择，可发现非线性本构模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要材料参数先验选择、仅限于模型库的线性系数或推断参数概率分布灵活性有限，因此需要更灵活的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 四步框架：1) 用高斯过程增强应力-变形数据；2) 用归一化流近似参数分布；3) 通过匹配参数诱导的应力-变形函数分布与高斯过程后验来精炼参数分布；4) 进行Sobol'敏感性分析以获得稀疏可解释模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了本构模型发现中的不确定性量化问题，无需先验选择且支持非线性模型发现，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Constitutive model discovery refers to the task of identifying an appropriate
model structure, usually from a predefined model library, while simultaneously
inferring its material parameters. The data used for model discovery are
measured in mechanical tests and are thus inevitably affected by noise which,
in turn, induces uncertainties. Previously proposed methods for uncertainty
quantification in model discovery either require the selection of a prior for
the material parameters, are restricted to the linear coefficients of the model
library or are limited in the flexibility of the inferred parameter probability
distribution. We therefore propose a four-step partially Bayesian framework for
uncertainty quantification in model discovery that does not require prior
selection for the material parameters and also allows for the discovery of
non-linear constitutive models: First, we augment the available
stress-deformation data with a Gaussian process. Second, we approximate the
parameter distribution by a normalizing flow, which allows for capturing
complex joint distributions. Third, we distill the parameter distribution by
matching the distribution of stress-deformation functions induced by the
parameters with the Gaussian process posterior. Fourth, we perform a Sobol'
sensitivity analysis to obtain a sparse and interpretable model. We demonstrate
the capability of our framework for both isotropic and anisotropic experimental
data as well as linear and non-linear model libraries.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在有限精度下进行流式PCA的低精度方法，建立了实现目标精度所需量化分辨率的信息论下界，并分析了Oja算法在线性和非线性随机量化下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在流式设置下使用有限精度计算进行主成分分析（PCA）的可行性，特别是在资源受限的环境中，如边缘计算设备，需要低精度量化来减少存储和计算开销。

Method: 采用Oja算法进行流式PCA，结合线性和非线性随机量化方案。量化变体使用权重向量和更新的无偏随机量化。在数据分布的温和矩和谱间隙假设下，分析了批处理版本在两种方案下的性能。

Result: 理论分析表明，批处理版本在两种量化方案下都能达到信息论下界（最多相差对数因子）。在非线性量化设置中，实现了几乎与维度无关的量化误差。实证评估验证了理论发现，显示低精度方法能紧密跟踪标准Oja算法的性能。

Conclusion: 低精度流式PCA在适当量化方案下是可行的，能够以有限精度实现接近全精度的性能，为资源受限环境中的PCA应用提供了理论基础和实用方法。

Abstract: Low-precision streaming PCA estimates the top principal component in a
streaming setting under limited precision. We establish an
information-theoretic lower bound on the quantization resolution required to
achieve a target accuracy for the leading eigenvector. We study Oja's algorithm
for streaming PCA under linear and nonlinear stochastic quantization. The
quantized variants use unbiased stochastic quantization of the weight vector
and the updates. Under mild moment and spectral-gap assumptions on the data
distribution, we show that a batched version achieves the lower bound up to
logarithmic factors under both schemes. This leads to a nearly dimension-free
quantization error in the nonlinear quantization setting. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic streams validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our
low-precision methods closely track the performance of standard Oja's
algorithm.

Conclusion: 归一化在transformer中起着速度调节的关键作用，该框架为比较不同归一化方案提供了理论基础，并表明Peri-LN是特别有效的归一化策略。

Abstract: We study the effect of normalization schemes on token representations in deep
transformers. Modeling their evolution as interacting particles on the sphere,
we show that normalization acts as a form of speed regulation. This perspective
enables a unified analysis of several schemes -- including Post-LN, Pre-LN,
Mix-LN, Peri-LN, nGPT, and LN-Scaling -- revealing how they influence
clustering dynamics and representation collapse. Our framework clarifies how
different schemes shape token representations across layers and provides a
principled basis for comparing them, identifying Peri-LN as a particularly
effective choice.

TL;DR: 论文分析了连续扩散模型在离散数据上表现不佳的原因，提出了token可识别性框架，揭示了离散身份破坏和连续秩退化两种机制，并提出了CANDI混合框架来解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续扩散模型在连续域（如图像生成）表现出色，但在离散数据上表现不如纯离散方法，这种差距与直觉相悖，因为连续扩散能够学习跨多个位置的联合演化分数函数。

Method: 提出了CANDI（连续和离散扩散）混合框架，将离散和连续破坏机制解耦，同时学习条件结构和连续几何。

Result: 实证验证了时间不协调现象，CANDI成功避免了这一问题，在受控生成中实现了基于分类器的引导，在文本生成中在低NFE下优于掩码扩散。

Conclusion: CANDI解锁了连续扩散在离散空间中的优势，展示了学习连续梯度对离散空间的价值。

Abstract: While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains
such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has
underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is
counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that
enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we
introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding
how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete
identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these
mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal
dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough
structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise
levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys
nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous
ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and
continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional
structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal
dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This
unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled
generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf
classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI
outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning
continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

Result: 实验结果表明所提方法具有有效性和渐近正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在存在多个潜在混杂变量的情况下，通过高阶累积量矩阵的秩缺陷特性直接识别因果结构，且无需迭代过程。

Abstract: Recovering causal structure in the presence of latent variables is an
important but challenging task. While many methods have been proposed to handle
it, most of them require strict and/or untestable assumptions on the causal
structure. In real-world scenarios, observed variables may be affected by
multiple latent variables simultaneously, which, generally speaking, cannot be
handled by these methods. In this paper, we consider the linear, non-Gaussian
case, and make use of the joint higher-order cumulant matrix of the observed
variables constructed in a specific way. We show that, surprisingly, causal
asymmetry between two observed variables can be directly seen from the rank
deficiency properties of such higher-order cumulant matrices, even in the
presence of an arbitrary number of latent confounders. Identifiability results
are established, and the corresponding identification methods do not even
involve iterative procedures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and asymptotic correctness of our proposed method.

<details>

Motivation: 传统机器学习依赖显式模型和领域假设，限制了灵活性和可解释性。

Result: 在大多数常见机器学习任务中达到或接近最先进性能，能够有效处理复杂数据类型包括缺失数据。

Conclusion: 这可能是神经网络之外的可扩展机器学习替代路径，能保持底层机制的人类可理解性。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain
assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a
model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to
directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution
modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits
and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty,
the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative
inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It
emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making,
offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and
achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine
learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of
information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide
variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results
indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with
regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can
maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.

Conclusion: 该方法通过输入空间引导确保去噪轨迹忠实于原始数据结构，提供自适应噪声处理、不确定性量化和可泛化去噪三个关键优势，显著提高了单细胞数据的聚类质量和生物解释性。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular
heterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based
on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological
variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from
different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate
clustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework
that separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is
operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion
prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while
to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional
observation space. This unique "input-space steering" ensures the denoising
trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers
three key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between
prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled
uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising
by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via
averaging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on
both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves
clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset
shifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved
biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries
that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个物理信息机器学习框架，用于建模和预测随机FitzHugh-Nagumo神经元中的自诱导随机共振现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自诱导随机共振(SISR)是在没有外部周期强迫或接近分岔的情况下，仅由噪声驱动的慢-快可激发系统中出现的相干振荡。需要开发数据高效且可解释的替代模型来模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性。

Method: 基于噪声增强状态预测器架构的物理信息神经网络(PINN)，将控制随机微分方程和SISR-渐近时间尺度匹配约束直接嵌入网络。复合损失函数整合了数据保真度、动力学残差和基于Kramers逃逸理论的物理约束。

Result: 训练后的PINN准确预测了尖峰序列相干性对噪声强度、兴奋性和时间尺度分离的依赖性，与直接随机模拟结果匹配，相比纯数据驱动方法在精度和泛化能力上有显著改进，同时计算需求大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该框架为模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性提供了一个数据高效且可解释的替代模型。

Abstract: Self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) is the emergence of coherent
oscillations in slow-fast excitable systems driven solely by noise, without
external periodic forcing or proximity to a bifurcation. This work presents a
physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling and predicting SISR in
the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron. We embed the governing stochastic
differential equations and SISR-asymptotic timescale-matching constraints
directly into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based on a
Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The composite loss integrates
data fidelity, dynamical residuals, and barrier-based physical constraints
derived from Kramers' escape theory. The trained PINN accurately predicts the
dependence of spike-train coherence on noise intensity, excitability, and
timescale separation, matching results from direct stochastic simulations with
substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization compared with purely
data-driven methods, while requiring significantly less computation. The
framework provides a data-efficient and interpretable surrogate model for
simulating and analyzing noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic
systems.

Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are the backbone of real-time grid operations,
across workflows such as contingency analysis (where repeated PF evaluations
assess grid security under outages) and topology optimization (which involves
PF-based searches over combinatorially large action spaces). Running these
calculations at operational timescales or across large evaluation spaces
remains a major computational bottleneck. Additionally, growing uncertainty in
power system operations from the integration of renewables and climate-induced
extreme weather also calls for tools that can accurately and efficiently
simulate a wide range of scenarios and operating conditions. Machine learning
methods offer a potential speedup over traditional solvers, but their
performance has not been systematically assessed on benchmarks that capture
real-world variability. This paper introduces PF$\Delta$, a benchmark dataset
for power flow that captures diverse variations in load, generation, and
topology. PF$\Delta$ contains 859,800 solved power flow instances spanning six
different bus system sizes, capturing three types of contingency scenarios (N ,
N -1, and N -2), and including close-to-infeasible cases near steady-state
voltage stability limits. We evaluate traditional solvers and GNN-based
methods, highlighting key areas where existing approaches struggle, and
identifying open problems for future research. Our dataset is available at

Abstract: We investigate the role of network architecture in shaping the inductive
biases of modern score-based generative models. To this end, we introduce the
Score Anisotropy Directions (SADs), architecture-dependent directions that
reveal how different networks preferentially capture data structure. Our
analysis shows that SADs form adaptive bases aligned with the architecture's
output geometry, providing a principled way to predict generalization ability
in score models prior to training. Through both synthetic data and standard
image benchmarks, we demonstrate that SADs reliably capture fine-grained model
behavior and correlate with downstream performance, as measured by Wasserstein
metrics. Our work offers a new lens for explaining and predicting directional
biases of generative models.

Motivation: 需要一种能够处理高维空间和现实世界约束的反事实解释生成方法，特别是在处理不可变特征（如年龄、性别等）时保持可行性。

Method: 使用分段采样边界逼近(SSBA)方法，通过二分搜索找到决策边界点，然后搜索最近的边界点，采用离散化方法处理约束条件。

Conclusion: SSBA提供了一种简单有效的模型无关方法，能够计算最近可行的反事实解释，特别适合处理高维数据和现实约束条件。

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual
explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting
our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints
on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation)
from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many
discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible
counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented
Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find
decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.
Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can
outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in
distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can
also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and
categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related
characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of
runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple
orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based
approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic
method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints)
counterfactual explanations. All of our results and our code can be found here

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to operate with high accuracy on
learning from graph-structured data, but they suffer from high computational
and resource costs. Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the
model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural
network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this
research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three
quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification
tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all
experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our
findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can
significantly reduce the model's size(50\%) while maintaining or even improving
precision after fine-tuning the pruned model. The evaluation of different
quantization methods on GNN shows diverse impacts on accuracy, inference time,
and model size across different datasets.

Abstract: Centered kernel alignment (CKA) is a popular metric for comparing
representations, determining equivalence of networks, and neuroscience
research. However, CKA does not account for the underlying manifold and relies
on numerous heuristics that cause it to behave differently at different scales
of data. In this work, we propose Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA),
which incorporates manifold geometry into the alignment task. We derive a
theoretical framework for MKA. We perform empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world examples to characterize and compare MKA to its
contemporaries. Our findings suggest that manifold-aware kernel alignment
provides a more robust foundation for measuring representations, with potential
applications in representation learning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了谱梯度下降(SpecGD)等谱感知优化器在数据不平衡情况下的泛化性能，发现与普通梯度下降(GD)相比，SpecGD能更均衡地学习数据的所有主成分，从而在训练早期获得更好的平衡准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Muon和Shampoo等谱感知矩阵值优化器在深度学习中的广泛应用，需要系统研究其泛化特性，特别是何时能超越竞争算法。

Method: 使用不平衡数据作为测试平台，研究谱梯度下降(SpecGD)的规范形式，并在高斯混合数据模型和线性/双线性模型中进行理论分析，扩展到深度线性模型。

Result: 与GD优先学习数据主导主成分不同，SpecGD以相同速率学习所有主成分，导致训练早期平衡准确率差距扩大，深度会放大这种效应。实验验证了谱方法变体(Muon、Shampoo)相比欧几里得对应方法和Adam具有更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 谱优化器通过促进数据基础成分的更均衡学习，实现了优越的泛化性能，特别适用于数据不平衡场景。

Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon
and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their
generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform
competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate
simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a
testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is
Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma
V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we
identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD
outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both
linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning
dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal
components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a
growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further
show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive
step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,
we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our
theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments
compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against
their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that
these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more
balanced learning of the data's underlying components.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Forests (AF)方法，通过自适应选择CART树权重来提升随机森林和XGBoost的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机森林和XGBoost在聚合CART树时使用等权重，但不同树在不同输入下的重要性可能不同，需要自适应权重分配

Method: 结合OP2T框架为不同输入分配定制化权重，并使用混合整数优化动态优化权重候选，提升整体性能

Result: 在20多个真实数据集上的二分类和多分类问题中，AF一致优于RF、XGBoost和其他加权RF方法

Conclusion: 自适应权重选择能显著提升集成学习模型的性能，AF方法具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Random Forests (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are two of the
most widely used and highly performing classification and regression models.
They aggregate equally weighted CART trees, generated randomly in RF or
sequentially in XGBoost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Forests (AF), a
novel approach that adaptively selects the weights of the underlying CART
models. AF combines (a) the Optimal Predictive-Policy Trees (OP2T) framework to
prescribe tailored, input-dependent unequal weights to trees and (b) Mixed
Integer Optimization (MIO) to refine weight candidates dynamically, enhancing
overall performance. We demonstrate that AF consistently outperforms RF,
XGBoost, and other weighted RF in binary and multi-class classification
problems over 20+ real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了针对动态数据流的近似最近邻搜索和近似核密度估计的亚线性空间草图算法，在流式模型和滑动窗口模型中实现了亚线性内存和查询时间保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模和动态数据流中，设计紧凑的草图来保持数据结构特性同时支持高效查询是一个核心挑战。现有工作主要关注精确最近邻搜索，而近似最近邻搜索的亚线性空间算法研究不足。

Method: 使用局部敏感哈希(LSH)技术，在流式模型中存储数据的一个亚线性部分(n^{-η})，在滑动窗口模型中设计基于LSH范围的紧凑草图结构。

Result: 流式ANN算法仅需O(n^{1+ρ-η})内存，支持亚线性查询时间和批量查询；滑动窗口A-KDE算法实现了O(RW·(1/(√(1+ε)-1))·log²N)大小的草图，这是该模型下首个理论亚线性草图保证。

Conclusion: 提出的草图算法在理论和实验上都表现出色，为大规模动态数据流中的ANN和A-KDE问题提供了高效实用的解决方案，填补了相关理论空白。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and Approximate Kernel Density
Estimation (A-KDE) are fundamental problems at the core of modern machine
learning, with broad applications in data analysis, information systems, and
large-scale decision making. In massive and dynamic data streams, a central
challenge is to design compact sketches that preserve essential structural
properties of the data while enabling efficient queries.
  In this work, we develop new sketching algorithms that achieve sublinear
space and query time guarantees for both ANN and A-KDE for a dynamic stream of
data. For ANN in the streaming model, under natural assumptions, we design a
sublinear sketch that requires only $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\rho-\eta})$ memory by
storing only a sublinear ($n^{-\eta}$) fraction of the total inputs, where
$\rho$ is a parameter of the LSH family, and $0<\eta<1$. Our method supports
sublinear query time, batch queries, and extends to the more general Turnstile
model. While earlier works have focused on Exact NN, this is the first result
on ANN that achieves near-optimal trade-offs between memory size and
approximation error.
  Next, for A-KDE in the Sliding-Window model, we propose a sketch of size
$\mathcal{O}\left(RW \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon} - 1} \log^2 N\right)$,
where $R$ is the number of sketch rows, $W$ is the LSH range, $N$ is the window
size, and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. This, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first theoretical sublinear sketch guarantee for A-KDE in the
Sliding-Window model.
  We complement our theoretical results with experiments on various real-world
datasets, which show that the proposed sketches are lightweight and achieve
consistently low error in practice.

Conclusion: 训练测试环境匹配对于构建可靠的现实世界代码修复代理至关重要，模型在跨环境泛化方面存在局限性。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real
repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation
unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix
build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning
dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced
a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL).
Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and
applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model
distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller,
and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions.
"Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models
failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of
matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing
agents.

Motivation: 传统固定分辨率方法无法捕捉气候事件的多尺度物理过程，而现有层次图神经网络在向下映射时会丢失全局趋势，削弱物理约束在预测中的作用。

Method: 设计潜在记忆保留机制来保持全局趋势，以及潜在到物理分支来集成不同尺度的偏微分方程解场。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了天气预报准确性，还通过高效训练显著降低了计算成本和碳足迹，对机器学习可持续发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by
global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure.
Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes
unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods
cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale
representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends,
weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast
and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a
multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a
Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward
traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields
across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead
times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability
for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a
single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such
efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges
sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in
the supplementary materials.

Result: 明确了基准测试结果支持不同类型科学主张所需的具体条件，揭示了基准测试作为机器学习认识论实践的重要性

Conclusion: 预测性基准测试是机器学习研究中的重要认识论实践，需要清晰的构建效度条件来支持从基准分数到科学推断的有效转换

Abstract: Predictive benchmarking, the evaluation of machine learning models based on
predictive performance and competitive ranking, is a central epistemic practice
in machine learning research and an increasingly prominent method for
scientific inquiry. Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of
model performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning
problem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about
theoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions
about the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,
and data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing
conditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.
We examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each
exemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in
computer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions
with WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life
events with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the
conditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,
bringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological
practice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine
learning.

Motivation: 传统PBPK建模使用常微分方程并依赖简化假设，限制了其对非线性生理相互作用的适应性，因此需要探索数据驱动的替代方法。

Method: 提出动态图神经网络，将生理连接建模为器官间的循环消息传递过程，同时实现了多层感知机(MLP)和长短期记忆网络(LSTM)作为基线模型。

Result: 动态GNN在所有模型中表现最佳，R²为0.9342，RMSE为0.0159，MAE为0.0116；MLP基线R²为0.8705，LSTM为0.8059。

Conclusion: 显式建模器官相互作用的时空依赖性能够实现更准确和可泛化的药物浓度预测，动态GNN为传统PBPK公式提供了可扩展、无方程的替代方案。

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role
in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs.
Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong
simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear
physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives
for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are
implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To
incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network
(Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent
message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all
models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In
comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves
0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and
temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and
generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a
scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and
demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in
preclinical and clinical research.

Motivation: 现有的隐量子马尔可夫模型学习算法对数据损坏高度敏感，缺乏在对抗性扰动下确保鲁棒性的机制。

Method: 提出了RILA算法，结合了基于熵过滤的移除损坏行模块和迭代随机重采样过程，使用L1惩罚似然目标来增强稳定性。

Result: 在多个HQMM和HMM基准测试中，RILA表现出优越的收敛稳定性、损坏恢复能力和物理有效性保持能力。

Conclusion: RILA为鲁棒量子序列学习建立了一个原则性且高效的方法。

Abstract: Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) extend classical Hidden Markov Models to
the quantum domain, offering a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling
sequential data with quantum coherence. However, existing HQMM learning
algorithms are highly sensitive to data corruption and lack mechanisms to
ensure robustness under adversarial perturbations. In this work, we introduce
the Adversarially Corrupted HQMM (AC-HQMM), which formalizes robustness
analysis by allowing a controlled fraction of observation sequences to be
adversarially corrupted. To learn AC-HQMMs, we propose the Robust Iterative
Learning Algorithm (RILA), a derivative-free method that integrates a Remove
Corrupted Rows by Entropy Filtering (RCR-EF) module with an iterative
stochastic resampling procedure for physically valid Kraus operator updates.
RILA incorporates L1-penalized likelihood objectives to enhance stability,
resist overfitting, and remain effective under non-differentiable conditions.
Across multiple HQMM and HMM benchmarks, RILA demonstrates superior convergence
stability, corruption resilience, and preservation of physical validity
compared to existing algorithms, establishing a principled and efficient
approach for robust quantum sequential learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法在处理高维和非均匀分布数据时，低密度边界样本容易被邻近聚类干扰，导致聚类结果不稳定和扭曲。

Method: 引入群体级优化机制，将低密度边界点聚合成协作移动的群体；结合局部密度估计和邻域拓扑，构建群体与周围环境的有效引力交互；使用群体作为基本运动单元，通过引力收缩策略确保全局稳定和方向一致的收敛。

Result: 在多个高维数据集上，GCAO优于11种代表性聚类方法，NMI、ARI、Homogeneity和ACC分别平均提升37.13%、52.08%、44.98%和38.81%，同时保持竞争性的效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: GCAO在保持聚类完整性、增强边界可分性和确保复杂数据分布上的鲁棒性能方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional and
non-uniformly distributed data, where low-density boundary samples are easily
disturbed by neighboring clusters, leading to unstable and distorted clustering
results. To address this issue, we propose a Group-driven Clustering via
Gravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) algorithm. GCAO introduces a
group-level optimization mechanism that aggregates low-density boundary points
into collaboratively moving groups, replacing the traditional point-based
contraction process. By combining local density estimation with neighborhood
topology, GCAO constructs effective gravitational interactions between groups
and their surroundings, enhancing boundary clarity and structural consistency.
Using groups as basic motion units, a gravitational contraction strategy
ensures globally stable and directionally consistent convergence. Experiments
on multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GCAO outperforms 11
representative clustering methods, achieving average improvements of 37.13%,
52.08%, 44.98%, and 38.81% in NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and ACC, respectively,
while maintaining competitive efficiency and scalability. These results
highlight GCAO's superiority in preserving cluster integrity, enhancing
boundary separability, and ensuring robust performance on complex data
distributions.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够高效地实现效用保持的机器遗忘，在遗忘效果和模型性能之间达到更好的平衡。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to efficiently remove sensitive or harmful
memory from a pre-trained model. The key challenge is to balance the potential
tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves
forgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's
original performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use
multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and
utility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only
guarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which
causes under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first
model MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the
unlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility
loss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to
unilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the
additional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an
implicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the
aforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,
thereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU. Theoretically, we provide a
tight convergence analysis of the algorithm. Empirically, our extensive
experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff results
than existing baselines. Codes are available at

Motivation: 传统近端梯度算法在图像重建等逆问题中经常违反非负约束，导致收敛不稳定和次优解，其根本原因是梯度下降步骤会引入负值并对超参数高度敏感。

Conclusion: SSO-PGA通过乘法更新机制有效解决了非负逆问题中的约束违反问题，提供了收敛保证，并在多模态恢复任务中展现出卓越的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Proximal gradient algorithms (PGA), while foundational for inverse problems
like image reconstruction, often yield unstable convergence and suboptimal
solutions by violating the critical non-negativity constraint. We identify the
gradient descent step as the root cause of this issue, which introduces
negative values and induces high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient
algorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for
robustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in
superseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,
which inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming
traditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,
augmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not
only improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise
immunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration
and derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded
into a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the
power of deep learning. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses traditional PGA and other
state-of-the-art algorithms, ensuring superior performance and stability.

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance,
yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black
box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since
researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this
paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by
investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we
introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing
(CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the
coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments
and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for
solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate
better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose
varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct
evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions
associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially
translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we
improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first
systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a
promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights
for the NCO community. The source code is publicly available.

Conclusion: 提出的新误差度量方法能够在噪声环境下构建更小、更有效的核心集，相比传统方法在真实聚类成本上提供更紧的近似保证。

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering when
the input dataset is corrupted by stochastic noise drawn from a known
distribution. In this setting, evaluating the quality of a coreset is
inherently challenging, as the true underlying dataset is unobserved. To
address this, we investigate coreset construction using surrogate error metrics
that are tractable and provably related to the true clustering cost. We analyze
a traditional metric from prior work and introduce a new error metric that more
closely aligns with the true cost. Although our metric is defined independently
of the noise distribution, it enables approximation guarantees that scale with
the noise level. We design a coreset construction algorithm based on this
metric and show that, under mild assumptions on the data and noise, enforcing
an $\varepsilon$-bound under our metric yields smaller coresets and tighter
guarantees on the true clustering cost than those obtained via classical
metrics. In particular, we prove that the coreset size can improve by a factor
of up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Experiments on
real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
practical advantages of our approach.

behind Shapley values and Shapley-style interaction indices with a
few-evaluation scheme on a tensor-network (TN) surrogate: TN-SHAP. The key idea
is to represent a predictor's local behavior as a factorized multilinear map,
so that coalitional quantities become linear probes of a coefficient tensor.
TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of
targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular,
both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost
O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide
theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP.
On UCI datasets, our method matches enumeration on the fitted surrogate while
reducing evaluation by orders of magnitude and achieves 25-1000x wall-clock
speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ at comparable accuracy, while amortizing training
across local cohorts.

Method: 采用信息论视角，形式化元强化学习的泛化问题，建立相应的泛化边界，并分析基于梯度的元强化学习算法的泛化性能。

Result: 建立了元强化学习在两种不同分布不匹配场景下的泛化边界，为理解元学习算法的泛化能力提供了理论框架。

Conclusion: 从信息论角度为元学习的分布外泛化问题提供了理论分析框架，有助于理解元学习算法在不同环境下的泛化性能。

Abstract: In this work, we study out-of-distribution generalization in meta-learning
from an information-theoretic perspective. We focus on two scenarios: (i) when
the testing environment mismatches the training environment, and (ii) when the
training environment is broader than the testing environment. The first
corresponds to the standard distribution mismatch setting, while the second
reflects a broad-to-narrow training scenario. We further formalize the
generalization problem in meta-reinforcement learning and establish
corresponding generalization bounds. Finally, we analyze the generalization
performance of a gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning algorithm.

Conclusion: NMKE通过细粒度的神经元级编辑策略，有效解决了终身知识编辑中的错误累积问题

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive
full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout
the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and
generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked
Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines
neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron
functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with
knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and
knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further
introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to
the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge
editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands
of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in
maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general
capabilities in lifelong editing.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves
privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its
prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled
by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air
FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy}
in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while
providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,
formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,
nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as
prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted
types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a
single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study
AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which
claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to
ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as
a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a
novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on
model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and
non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power
allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which
also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising
training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive
numerical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性引入了安全漏洞，恶意客户端可能破坏或操纵训练过程。

Method: 提出了具体的攻击策略，使独裁者客户端能够控制训练过程，并分析了多个独裁者客户端协作、独立行动或背叛联盟等复杂场景。

Result: 理论分析和实证评估表明，独裁者客户端能够有效消除其他客户端的贡献，影响全局模型的收敛。

Conclusion: 独裁者客户端是联邦学习中一个严重的安全威胁，需要开发相应的防御机制来应对这种攻击。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized
model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared
model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of
FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or
manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a
novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants
capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the
server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies
that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the
learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple
dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or
form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these
settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global
model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex
scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by
empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于排序的嵌入方法β_A，改进了嵌入维度D的上界并给出了下界，证明了其双Lipschitz失真与n的平方相关且与d无关，并给出了至少Ω(√n)的失真下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度学习应用中，特别是图神经网络中，需要保持对图节点排列的不变性。基于排序的嵌入方法β_A能够提供这种不变性，但之前的研究存在两个主要问题：最优嵌入维度D未知，以及缺乏对双Lipschitz常数的估计。

Method: 研究排序嵌入β_A: ℝ^(n×d) → ℝ^(n×D)，其中X ↦ ↓(XA)，↓表示矩阵的列排序。通过构造特定的矩阵A来分析嵌入的注入性和双Lipschitz性质。

Result: 改进了注入性所需嵌入维度D的上界，并给出了最小注入维度的下界。构造了使得β_A的双Lipschitz失真与n²相关且与d无关的矩阵A，并证明了失真至少为Ω(√n)。

Conclusion: 该研究在基于排序的嵌入方法的理论分析方面取得了重要进展，为图深度学习中的排列不变嵌入提供了更完整的理论保证，特别是在嵌入维度和稳定性方面。

Abstract: We study the sorting-based embedding $\beta_{\mathbf A} : \mathbb R^{n \times
d} \to \mathbb R^{n \times D}$, $\mathbf X \mapsto {\downarrow}(\mathbf X
\mathbf A)$, where $\downarrow$ denotes column wise sorting of matrices. Such
embeddings arise in graph deep learning where outputs should be invariant to
permutations of graph nodes. Previous work showed that for large enough $D$ and
appropriate $\mathbf A$, the mapping $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is injective, and
moreover satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition. However, two gaps remain: firstly,
the optimal size $D$ required for injectivity is not yet known, and secondly,
no estimates of the bi-Lipschitz constants of the mapping are known.
  In this paper, we make substantial progress in addressing both of these gaps.
Regarding the first gap, we improve upon the best known upper bounds for the
embedding dimension $D$ necessary for injectivity, and also provide a lower
bound on the minimal injectivity dimension. Regarding the second gap, we
construct matrices $\mathbf A$, so that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of
$\beta_{\mathbf A} $ depends quadratically on $n$, and is completely
independent of $d$. We also show that the distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is
necessarily at least in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we provide similar results
for variants of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ obtained by applying linear projections to
reduce the output dimension of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$.

Motivation: 现有任务通用预训练EEG模型在复杂任务如情感识别上表现不佳，因为任务特定特征与广泛预训练方法不匹配。需要解决跨数据集分布偏移、情感类别定义不一致和个体间变异性大的问题。

Method: 使用跨数据集协方差对齐损失对齐二阶统计特性；提出混合编码器结合Mamba-like线性注意力通道编码器和时空动态模型来捕捉EEG长期依赖和复杂动态。

Result: 在少样本情感识别中AUROC平均提升4.57%，在零样本泛化到新数据集时准确率提升11.92%。多数据集联合预训练比单数据集训练性能提升8.55%。

Conclusion: 该工作为任务特定预训练提供了可扩展框架，并展示了其在可泛化情感计算中的优势。

Abstract: Task-specific pre-training is essential when task representations diverge
from generic pre-training features. Existing task-general pre-training EEG
models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches
between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work
aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for
cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset
distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial
inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment
loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling
robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject
calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG,
we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel
encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for
few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot
generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of
datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a
performance gain of 8.55% over single-dataset training. This work provides a
scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in
generalizable affective computing. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在有损压缩领域的应用，在重建保真度和压缩比之间进行权衡，利用LLM作为强大的概率模型。

Method: 提出误差有界预测编码(EPC)，使用掩码语言模型作为解压缩器，允许模型预测掩码内容，仅在模型预测错误时存储基于排名的最小修正，创建提供连续率失真控制的残差通道。

Result: EPC在率失真分析中始终优于预测掩码(PM)基线，通过更有效地利用模型内在知识，在显著更低的比特率下提供更优的保真度。

Conclusion: EPC证明了利用LLM内在知识进行有损文本压缩的有效性，通过残差通道实现连续率失真控制，在压缩效率和重建质量方面优于基线方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by
acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy
domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios.
This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec
that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of
storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked
content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top
prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous
rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM)
baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch
(VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting
and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates
PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more
efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练模型在不同设计选择下表现出多样化的泛化行为，某些模型掌握了其他模型无法获得的数据特定洞察，这为模型间知识迁移提供了机会。

Method: 提出数据分区策略，预训练模型自主选择学生或教师角色，支持双向知识迁移、跨架构知识迁移以及多模型间知识迁移。

Result: 在图像分类中ViT-B性能提升约1.4%；语义分割中所有评估指标均有提升；视频显著性预测达到新SOTA；多模型知识迁移带来显著性能改进。

Conclusion: 利用模型库作为辅助知识源是有效的模型改进策略，通过自主角色分配和知识迁移能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape,
offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that
models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse
generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific
insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large
publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model
improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models
autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of
a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we
improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional
knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted
all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across
backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a
new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer
between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for
all model participants.

Conclusion: 该交互式框架通过结构化模型特征重要性空间和聚类分析，帮助利益相关者更好地理解和选择符合其需求的公平机器学习模型，促进知情决策。

Abstract: In the context of algorithmic decision-making, fair machine learning methods
often yield multiple models that balance predictive fairness and performance in
varying degrees. This diversity introduces a challenge for stakeholders who
must select a model that aligns with their specific requirements and values. To
address this, we propose an interactive framework that assists in navigating
and interpreting the trade-offs across a portfolio of models. Our approach
leverages weakly supervised metric learning to learn a Mahalanobis distance
that reflects similarity in fairness and performance outcomes, effectively
structuring the feature importance space of the models according to
stakeholder-relevant criteria. We then apply clustering technique (k-means) to
group models based on their transformed representations of feature importances,
allowing users to explore clusters of models with similar predictive behaviors
and fairness characteristics. This facilitates informed decision-making by
helping users understand how models differ not only in their
fairness-performance balance but also in the features that drive their
predictions.

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a widely adopted technique for improving the
efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods
demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their
effect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on
long-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in
modern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more
computation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
pruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with
performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when
performance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.
Furthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to
recover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,
we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and
highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to
reasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning
strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the
robustness of reasoning. We open-source the codebase in

Motivation: 解决EEG数据中电极布局异构性导致的模型泛化问题，现有方法难以在不同电极配置的数据集间迁移。

Method: 使用学习查询和交叉注意力将多通道EEG压缩到固定大小的潜在空间，下游transformer块仅在此潜在表示上使用补丁式时间自注意力操作，解耦计算与电极数量。

Conclusion: LUNA通过统一的潜在表示有效解决了EEG拓扑异构性问题，实现了高效的跨数据集迁移和显著的计算效率提升。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive lens into human brain
activity, but building large-scale models is hampered by topological
heterogeneity: each public EEG data defines its own electrode layout, limiting
generalization. We introduce LUNA (Latent Unified Network Architecture), a
self-supervised foundation model that reconciles disparate electrode geometries
while scaling linearly -- not quadratically -- with channel count. LUNA
compresses multi-channel EEG into a fixed-size, topology-agnostic latent space
via learned queries and cross-attention. Downstream transformer blocks then
operate exclusively on this latent representation using patch-wise temporal
self-attention, decoupling computation from electrode count. Pre-trained on
TUEG and Siena (over 21,000 hours of raw EEG across diverse montages) using a
masked-patch reconstruction objective, LUNA transfers effectively to four
downstream tasks: abnormality detection, artifact rejection, slowing
classification, and emotion recognition. It demonstrates highly competitive
performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on
TUAR and TUSL, e.g., 0.921 AUROC on TUAR, while reducing FLOPs by 300x and
trimming GPU memory use by up to 10x. Critically, these gains are consistent
across all evaluated electrode configurations. Code is available at

Conclusion: 真正的智能涉及识别和管理自身知识的局限，认知深度学习为实现这一目标提供了有效框架，推动了人工智能向更加可靠和稳健的方向发展。

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable successes, yet its deployment in
safety-critical domains remains hindered by an inherent inability to manage
uncertainty, resulting in overconfident and unreliable predictions when models
encounter out-of-distribution data, adversarial perturbations, or naturally
fluctuating environments. This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling
Machine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these
critical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial
Intelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the
uncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as
opposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby
empowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from
overconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.
  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network
(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief
functions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty
through the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including
its adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather
classification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a
unified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive
experiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning
not only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also
lays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the
ability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and
dependable systems. The title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work,
emphasizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits
of one's own knowledge.

Motivation: 现实世界中的测试图常存在数据质量问题和分布偏移，这会降低预训练GNN模型的性能。研究发现调整测试图的同配性可以显著改善模型鲁棒性。

Method: 开发同配性预测器来判别测试边，基于预测的同配性分数置信度进行自适应的测试时图结构变换。

Conclusion: 测试时图结构变换是提升预训练GNN模型鲁棒性的有效方法，GrapHoST通过自适应调整同配性实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of nodes from the same class to connect, is a
fundamental property of real-world graphs, underpinning structural and semantic
patterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks. Existing
methods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures
or graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN
learning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs
often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain
shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal
evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time
periods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's
robustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical
observations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test
graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it
in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance
of pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training
or update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural
transformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.
Specifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,
facilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the
confidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine
benchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate
that GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 10.92%. Our code has been released at

TL;DR: 利用迁移学习微调ECGFounder模型，从心电图信号中非侵入性地估计实验室指标，在108个指标中33个表现良好，59个中等，16个有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前实验室检测依赖侵入性静脉采样且存在延迟，心电图作为非侵入性信号有望实现快速实验室指标估计。

Method: 使用迁移学习方法微调ECGFounder预训练模型，在MC-MED数据集上生成2000多万个标准化10秒心电图片段。

Result: 内部验证显示，模型对33个实验室指标有强预测性能(AUC>0.65)，59个指标中等性能(0.55-0.65)，16个指标性能有限(<0.55)。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了高效AI驱动解决方案，确立了实时非侵入性实验室值估计的可行性范围。

Abstract: Timely access to laboratory values is critical for clinical decision-making,
yet current approaches rely on invasive venous sampling and are intrinsically
delayed. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a non-invasive and widely available
signal, offers a promising modality for rapid laboratory estimation. Recent
progress in deep learning has enabled the extraction of latent hematological
signatures from ECGs. However, existing models are constrained by low
signal-to-noise ratios, substantial inter-individual variability, limited data
diversity, and suboptimal generalization, especially when adapted to low-lead
wearable devices. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study leveraging
transfer learning to fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pre-trained ECG
foundation model, on the Multimodal Clinical Monitoring in the Emergency
Department (MC-MED) dataset from Stanford. We generated a corpus of more than
20 million standardized ten-second ECG segments to enhance sensitivity to
subtle biochemical correlates. On internal validation, the model demonstrated
strong predictive performance (area under the curve above 0.65) for
thirty-three laboratory indicators, moderate performance (between 0.55 and
0.65) for fifty-nine indicators, and limited performance (below 0.55) for
sixteen indicators. This study provides an efficient artificial-intelligence
driven solution and establishes the feasibility scope for real-time,
non-invasive estimation of laboratory values.

TL;DR: LLMs通过类比推理生成新型电池材料，超越传统掺杂替换，在科学创新中展现出专家级假设生成能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类类比推理受限于领域专业知识和表面偏见，而LLMs拥有跨领域数据训练优势，有望在科学发现中实现更深层次的结构驱动类比

Method: 使用两种明确类比推理策略：(1)检索跨领域类比和类比引导示例来扩展探索范围；(2)从少量标记样本构建领域内类比模板来指导定向开发

Result: 这些策略产生了既定成分空间之外的候选材料，并且优于标准提示基准

Conclusion: LLMs可作为可解释的、类似专家的假设生成器，利用类比驱动的泛化能力推动科学创新

Abstract: Analogical reasoning, the transfer of relational structures across contexts
(e.g., planet is to sun as electron is to nucleus), is fundamental to
scientific discovery. Yet human insight is often constrained by domain
expertise and surface-level biases, limiting access to deeper, structure-driven
analogies both within and across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast cross-domain data, present a promising yet underexplored tool
for analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can
generate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and
analogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant
substitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few
labeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical
reasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces
and outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as
interpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven
generalization for scientific innovation.

*Jiazheng Li,Andreas Damianou,J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Konstantina Palla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Concept Walk框架，通过分析模型内部激活在概念方向上的演化来评估推理链的真实性，发现简单案例中推理链常被忽略（装饰性推理），而困难案例中推理链能持续影响内部激活（真实性推理）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理链（CoT）不能忠实反映语言模型的内部计算过程，可能导致从业者误将装饰性推理当作真实推理，需要新的方法来验证推理链的真实性。

Method: Concept Walk框架在激活空间中操作，将每个推理步骤投影到从对比数据学习的概念方向上，追踪模型内部立场随概念方向的演化过程。

Result: 在Qwen 3-4B模型的安全领域案例研究中发现：简单案例中扰动的推理链被快速忽略，表明装饰性推理；困难案例中扰动会持续改变内部激活，表明真实性推理。

Conclusion: Concept Walk提供了通过概念特定内部动态重新检验推理真实性的方法，有助于识别何时可以信任推理链，何时可能误导从业者。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language
models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of
internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may
misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a
general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with
respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept
Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the
concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe
whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we
apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in
'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative
reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in
internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is
methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through
concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can
be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出平滑梯度上升(SGA)方法解决LLM遗忘中的梯度上升(GA)不稳定性问题，通过在遗忘数据与正常数据之间设置可调平滑率，实现更稳定的遗忘同时保持模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有梯度上升(GA)方法在LLM遗忘中存在严重不稳定性，导致模型效用急剧下降，需要更稳定的遗忘方法。

Method: SGA将遗忘数据与多个构建的正常数据通过可调平滑率结合，从仅在遗忘数据上学习扩展到在遗忘和正常数据上联合学习。

Result: 在TOFU、Harry Potter和MUSE-NEWS三个基准测试中，SGA在所有指标上始终优于原始GA方法，并在多个关键指标上达到所有基线方法的前2名性能。

Conclusion: SGA通过平滑梯度上升机制有效解决了GA的不稳定性问题，实现了更稳定的LLM遗忘同时更好地保持模型效用。

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models
to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much
model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward
method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby
forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from
severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often
resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we
propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with
multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively,
this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning
across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while
better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical
guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we
evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original
Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance
among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

TL;DR: 提出用康威生命游戏替代传统dropout进行正则化，通过动态单元失活和空间模式演化来提升神经网络泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统dropout存在静态性和缺乏可解释性的局限，需要更动态、自适应的正则化方法。

Method: 将神经网络单元表示为生命游戏网格中的细胞，应用游戏规则动态失活单元，形成自适应训练数据的空间模式。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，该方法与传统dropout性能相当，同时能通过演化模式可视化提供网络行为洞察。

Conclusion: 基于生命游戏的动态单元失活是有效的正则化替代方案，特别适用于深层架构，能增强不同dropout技术的性能。

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and
improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely
used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to
introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its
effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization
by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata
with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce
dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units
as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This
approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the
training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing
that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to
traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's
behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our
discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper
architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different
dropout techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台用户行为不断变化导致数据漂移，使模型性能下降。持续学习中的回放方法虽然能缓解灾难性遗忘，但受限于固定大小的缓冲区。

Method: 在回放式持续学习框架中引入基于外部知识库的数据增强方法，评估了多种整合外部知识的策略。

Result: 实验使用三个异常行为分类数据集，证明增强方法优于基线回放方法。

Conclusion: 通过整合外部知识的数据增强能有效提升回放式持续学习在应对数据漂移问题上的性能。

Abstract: User behavior on online platforms is evolving, reflecting real-world changes
in how people post, whether it's helpful messages or hate speech. Models that
learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over
time due to data drift, which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics
systems. However, fine-tuning such a model over time with new data can be
detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based approaches in
continual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models,
minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances
from past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the
fixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome
this limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel
augmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the
replay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with
three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to
assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and
demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based
approaches.

TL;DR: SmartMixed是一种两阶段训练策略，让神经网络学习每个神经元的最优激活函数，同时保持推理时的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络使用固定统一的激活函数，限制了网络表达能力。SmartMixed旨在让网络自适应选择最优激活函数。

Method: 第一阶段：神经元从候选激活函数池中通过可微分硬混合机制自适应选择；第二阶段：根据学习到的选择固定每个神经元的激活函数。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上的评估显示，不同层的神经元对激活函数有不同偏好，揭示了神经网络架构中的功能多样性。

Conclusion: SmartMixed成功实现了神经元级别的激活函数自适应选择，同时保持了推理效率，为神经网络架构设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks,
yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across
all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows
networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving
computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively
select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh,
Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the
second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the
learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that
supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate
SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying
depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct
preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional
diversity within neural architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图提示方法主要关注特征导向的方法，忽视了拓扑导向提示的潜力，导致性能次优。本研究首次探索图拓扑方面的提示策略。

Method: 将拓扑导向提示重新表述为多跳局部子图中的边重连问题，通过重参数化将其松弛到连续概率空间，同时确保紧密松弛和保持图稀疏性。

Result: 在5个图数据集和4种预训练策略下的广泛实验表明，GraphTOP在多个节点分类数据集上优于6个基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphTOP是首个有效的图拓扑导向提示框架，能够显著提升预训练图神经网络在下游任务中的适配性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph learning
by learning expressive graph representations from massive graph data. As a
common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme
first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an
effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while
keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting
studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to
node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve
suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of
*topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the
graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph
prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph**
**T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively
adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we
reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within
multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space
through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph
sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training
strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on
multiple node classification datasets. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了GradLite优化器，通过放松对精确梯度的要求，在丢弃中间激活时实现高效训练，减少内存消耗达50%且性能不降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器需要精确梯度，导致大语言模型全微调时内存消耗巨大，现有解决方案要么改变架构要么牺牲计算效率，但优化器本身未被改进

Method: 使用低秩雅可比矩阵近似降低反向传播误差信号的维度，结合误差反馈校正技术累积补偿近似误差，保持收敛保证

Result: 理论分析显示GradLite保持无偏梯度估计且有界方差，收敛率与Adam相当；实证表明减少优化器状态和激活内存达50%，在推理、多语言和对话基准上性能相当或优于基线方法

Conclusion: GradLite是一种向后友好的优化器，通过放松精确梯度要求实现内存高效的大语言模型训练，无需架构修改即可显著减少内存消耗

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is notoriously
memory-intensive, primarily because conventional optimizers such as SGD or Adam
assume access to exact gradients derived from cached activations. Existing
solutions either alter the model architecture (e.g., reversible networks) or
trade memory for computation (e.g., activation checkpointing), but the
optimizer itself remains untouched. In this work, we introduce GradLite, a
backward-friendly optimizer that relaxes the requirement of exact gradients,
enabling efficient training even when intermediate activations are aggressively
discarded or approximated. GradLite leverages two key techniques: (i) low-rank
Jacobian approximation, which reduces the dimensionality of backpropagated
error signals, and (ii) error-feedback correction, which accumulates and
compensates approximation errors across iterations to preserve convergence
guarantees. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that GradLite maintains
unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance, ensuring convergence rates
comparable to Adam. Empirically, GradLite reduces optimizer-state and
activation memory consumption by up to 50\% without architectural changes, and
achieves on-par or superior downstream performance on reasoning (MMLU, GSM8K),
multilingual, and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and
optimizer-centric baselines (LoMo, GaLore).

Result: 实验表明CORGII在准确性和效率之间提供了更好的权衡，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: CORGII是首个使用离散token映射到高效倒排列表的稠密图表示索引器，实现了更好的检索性能。

Abstract: Retrieving graphs from a large corpus, that contain a subgraph isomorphic to
a given query graph, is a core operation in many real-world applications. While
recent multi-vector graph representations and scores based on set alignment and
containment can provide accurate subgraph isomorphism tests, their use in
retrieval remains limited by their need to score corpus graphs exhaustively. We
introduce CORGII (Contextual Representation of Graphs for Inverted Indexing), a
graph indexing framework in which, starting with a contextual dense graph
representation, a differentiable discretization module computes sparse binary
codes over a learned latent vocabulary. This text document-like representation
allows us to leverage classic, highly optimized inverted indices, while
supporting soft (vector) set containment scores. Pushing this paradigm further,
we replace the classical, fixed impact weight of a `token' on a graph (such as
TFIDF or BM25) with a data-driven, trainable impact weight. Finally, we explore
token expansion to support multi-probing the index for smoother
accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. To our knowledge, CORGII is the first indexer of
dense graph representations using discrete tokens mapping to efficient inverted
lists. Extensive experiments show that CORGII provides better trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency, compared to several baselines.

Motivation: 解决当前3D生成方法依赖大数据集、可控性差、泛化能力有限的问题，实现数据高效且可控的3D几何生成。

Method: 首先通过共享初始化对齐SDF解码器，然后在对齐权重空间中求解参数约束混合问题，并引入线性度不匹配安全指标检测几何有效性。

Result: 在DrivAerNet++和BlendedNet基准测试中，LAMP仅需100个样本即可实现边界内插值、100%参数外推和物理性能优化，显著优于条件自编码器和DNI基线。

Conclusion: LAMP推进了可控、数据高效且安全的3D生成，适用于设计探索、数据集生成和性能驱动优化。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter
constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current
methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with
controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of
Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and
interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)
decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then
synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in
the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety
metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP
on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that
LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100
samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond
training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed
parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep
Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable,
data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset
generation, and performance-driven optimization.

Motivation: 随着AI系统在复杂任务上超越人类专家，获取高质量的人类监督变得困难。人类专家通常只在狭窄领域有专业知识，无法直接评估AI在超人类任务上的表现，但可以提供指出错误选项的弱信号

Method: 从互补标签推导出无偏的top-1准确率估计器，量化需要多少互补标签才能匹配普通标签的方差。引入两种估计器来结合稀缺的普通标签和丰富的互补标签，并提供有限样本偏差保证

Result: 实证表明，使用互补标签可以在没有真实标签的情况下评估大语言模型的输出，并且可以训练AI系统在这种弱信号下表现更好

Conclusion: 通过人类分区监督的可扩展监督框架能够有效利用人类专家的狭窄专业知识来评估和训练前沿AI系统，解决了超人类任务监督的挑战

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human
performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human
supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our
focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.
Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single
narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI
systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,
humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an
option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is
not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.
Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that
enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the
ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from
complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to
match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to
combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide
finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed
estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large
language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We
further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how
we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with
this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LLEMA通过强制执行可合成性和多目标权衡，为加速实用材料发现提供了原则性途径。

Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the
scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed
evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM
proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide
subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,
energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are
chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving
higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only
baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,
memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing
synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled
pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

TL;DR: 提出Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL)算法，用于离线目标条件强化学习，通过分治策略减少偏差积累和方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线目标条件强化学习中传统方法（如TD和Monte Carlo）存在的偏差积累和高方差问题，特别是在长轨迹任务中。

Method: 将GCRL中的三角不等式结构转化为实用的分治价值更新规则，只需O(log T)次递归处理长度为T的轨迹。

Result: 在具有挑战性的长视野基准任务中，TRL相比之前的离线GCRL算法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: TRL算法通过分治范式有效解决了离线GCRL中的价值学习问题，在偏差控制和方差减少方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: In this work, we present Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL), a new value
learning algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm. TRL is designed for
offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim
is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the
smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present
in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several
advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to
temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as
in principle it only requires $O(\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in
TD learning) to handle a length-$T$ trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL
suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming.
Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly
challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL
algorithms.

Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex
patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the
noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged
as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties,
graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph
representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research
investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success
of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose
RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint
Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic
GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as
the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation,
RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable
objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational
approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed
graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness
of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.

TL;DR: 提出了SDC-GBB算法，通过分组分支定界框架解决带约束聚类的NP-hard问题，能处理大规模数据集并保证全局最优性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合整数优化方法只能处理小规模数据集，限制了带约束聚类的实际应用，需要可扩展的全局优化方法

Method: 将必须连接样本折叠为质心伪样本，通过几何规则剪枝不能连接约束，结合分组样本拉格朗日分解和几何消除规则计算高效上下界

Result: 能处理20万样本的不能连接约束和150万样本的必须连接约束，比现有方法规模大200-1500倍，最优性差距小于3%

Conclusion: 该方法提供了确定性全局保证，避免了启发式方法在大数据集上的搜索失败问题

Abstract: Constrained clustering leverages limited domain knowledge to improve
clustering performance and interpretability, but incorporating pairwise
must-link and cannot-link constraints is an NP-hard challenge, making global
optimization intractable. Existing mixed-integer optimization methods are
confined to small-scale datasets, limiting their utility. We propose
Sample-Driven Constrained Group-Based Branch-and-Bound (SDC-GBB), a
decomposable branch-and-bound (BB) framework that collapses must-linked samples
into centroid-based pseudo-samples and prunes cannot-link through geometric
rules, while preserving convergence and guaranteeing global optimality. By
integrating grouped-sample Lagrangian decomposition and geometric elimination
rules for efficient lower and upper bounds, the algorithm attains highly
scalable pairwise k-Means constrained clustering via parallelism. Experimental
results show that our approach handles datasets with 200,000 samples with
cannot-link constraints and 1,500,000 samples with must-link constraints, which
is 200 - 1500 times larger than the current state-of-the-art under comparable
constraint settings, while reaching an optimality gap of less than 3%. In
providing deterministic global guarantees, our method also avoids the search
failures that off-the-shelf heuristics often encounter on large datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了随机搜索神经网络(RSNN)来解决随机游走神经网络(RWNN)在图表示学习中的局限性，通过随机搜索保证完整节点覆盖，在稀疏图中显著降低采样复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走神经网络(RWNNs)在实际采样约束下往往无法捕捉图的全局结构，因为节点和边覆盖不完整，限制了其表达能力。

Method: 提出随机搜索神经网络(RSNNs)，基于随机搜索操作，每个搜索保证完整节点覆盖。理论证明在稀疏图中仅需O(log|V|)次搜索即可实现完整边覆盖。

Result: RSNNs在分子和蛋白质基准测试中始终优于RWNNs，使用最多16倍更少的采样序列就能达到相当或更好的性能。

Conclusion: RSNNs为稀疏图学习提供了一个高效且表达能力强的框架，在理论和实践上推进了基于随机游走的方法。

Abstract: Random walk neural networks (RWNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for
graph representation learning, leveraging recent advances in sequence models to
process random walks. However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs
often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete
node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we
propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random
searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to
achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared
to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph
size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are
universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant
to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant
graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular
and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to
16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical
advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive
framework for learning on sparse graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IsoNet++是一种早期交互图神经网络，通过跨图消息传递、懒更新对齐和节点对伙伴交互等创新技术，显著提升了子图匹配的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子图同构检索方法如IsoNet使用后期交互模型，独立计算图嵌入后再进行对齐。为了更有效地进行子图匹配，需要开发早期交互模型来在嵌入计算过程中直接考虑图之间的交互。

Method: 1. 在输入图之间进行跨图消息传递，基于节点间的单射对齐；2. 在多轮中懒更新对齐，每轮基于当前对齐状态从头运行分层GNN；3. 引入节点对伙伴交互概念，考虑节点对而非单个节点作为潜在伙伴。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，随着轮次的增加，对齐逐步优化，检索性能显著优于现有方法。所有三个创新都对精度提升有贡献。

Conclusion: IsoNet++通过早期交互、懒更新对齐和节点对交互等创新，在子图匹配任务上取得了优越的性能，证明了这些技术改进的有效性。

Abstract: Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world
applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and
circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for
subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each
graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment
map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network
(GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of
all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by
an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in
a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN
from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion
of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments,
and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of
node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention
between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention
then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node
pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between
the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for
refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the
alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in
significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We
demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our
code and datasets are publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO)方法，通过参数化奖励惩罚机制处理强化学习中存在缺陷的正向轨迹，提高语言模型的推理能力和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习可验证奖励(RLVR)中，模型会探索推理轨迹并利用正确答案作为正向信号进行策略优化。然而，这些轨迹可能包含答案猜测和跳跃推理等缺陷模式，这些有缺陷的正向轨迹与完全正确的轨迹获得相同奖励，导致策略模型内化不可靠的推理模式。

Method: 提出FAPO方法，对有缺陷的正向轨迹实施参数化奖励惩罚，使其在预热阶段作为有用捷径，在后期精炼阶段逐步转向可靠推理。引入生成奖励模型(GenRM)和过程级奖励来精确检测推理错误。

Result: 实验表明FAPO在多个领域有效，提高了结果正确性、过程可靠性和训练稳定性，且不增加token预算。

Conclusion: FAPO能够有效处理强化学习中的缺陷正向轨迹问题，使模型在保持早期能力增益的同时，逐步转向更可靠的推理模式，显著提升推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and
exploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy
optimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as
answer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are
rewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to
internalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct
a systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable
rapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining
reasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on
these insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which
presents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling
the policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing
stable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable
reasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively
detect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)
with a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.
Experiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome
correctness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the
token budget.

Motivation: 随着技术进步，过程日志现在来自非确定性源（如不确定传感器或机器学习模型），这些随机日志包含概率信息，需要可靠的随机轨迹恢复方法来理解系统过程。

Method: 基于扩散去噪概率模型(DDPM)的深度学习方法，利用过程知识（通过隐式发现模型或显式注入训练阶段）通过去噪来恢复轨迹。

Result: 经验评估显示达到最先进性能，比现有方法提升高达25%，在高噪声水平下具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为随机轨迹恢复提供了一种有效的深度学习方法，特别适用于处理来自非确定性源的过程日志。

Abstract: With recent technological advances, process logs, which were traditionally
deterministic in nature, are being captured from non-deterministic sources,
such as uncertain sensors or machine learning models (that predict activities
using cameras). In the presence of stochastically-known logs, logs that contain
probabilistic information, the need for stochastic trace recovery increases, to
offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems.
We design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery, based
on Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes use of process
knowledge (either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting
process knowledge in the training phase) to recover traces by denoising. We
conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with
up to a 25% improvement over existing methods, along with increased robustness
under high noise levels.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于学习对抗性凸成本函数序列同时近似满足对抗性在线凸约束序列的随时在线算法，无需提前知道时间范围长度即可获得最优性能边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法通常需要提前知道时间范围长度T，或者使用性能较差的加倍技巧，这限制了实际应用。需要开发无需先验知识的随时算法。

Method: 使用时间变化的Lyapunov函数来跟踪约束违反情况，而不是使用固定Lyapunov函数。引入新的分析技术来处理时间变化Lyapunov函数带来的挑战。

Result: 算法对任意t≥1实现了O(√t)的遗憾和Õ(√t)的累积约束违反边界。还扩展到动态遗憾设置和乐观设置，并在在线最短路径问题上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的随时在线算法通过时间变化Lyapunov函数实现了最优性能边界，无需先验知识，在理论和实验上都表现出色。

Abstract: We propose an anytime online algorithm for the problem of learning a sequence
of adversarial convex cost functions while approximately satisfying another
sequence of adversarial online convex constraints. A sequential algorithm is
called \emph{anytime} if it provides a non-trivial performance guarantee for
any intermediate timestep $t$ without requiring prior knowledge of the length
of the entire time horizon $T$. Our proposed algorithm achieves optimal
performance bounds without resorting to the standard doubling trick, which has
poor practical performance due to multiple restarts. Our core technical
contribution is the use of time-varying Lyapunov functions to keep track of
constraint violations. This must be contrasted with prior works that used a
fixed Lyapunov function tuned to the known horizon length $T$. The use of
time-varying Lyapunov function poses unique analytical challenges as
properties, such as \emph{monotonicity}, on which the prior proofs rest, no
longer hold. By introducing a new analytical technique, we show that our
algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{t})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t})$ cumulative
constraint violation bounds for any $t\geq 1$.
  We extend our results to the dynamic regret setting, achieving bounds that
adapt to the path length of the comparator sequence without prior knowledge of
its total length. We also present an adaptive algorithm in the optimistic
setting, whose performance gracefully scales with the cumulative prediction
error. We demonstrate the practical utility of our algorithm through numerical
experiments involving the online shortest path problem.

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a recently proposed statistical
inference technique for parameter estimation that leverages pseudo-labels on
both labeled and unlabeled data to construct an unbiased, low-variance
estimator. In this work, we extend its core idea to semi-supervised learning
(SSL) for model training, introducing a novel unbiased gradient estimator. This
extension addresses a key challenge in SSL: while unlabeled data can improve
model performance, its benefit heavily depends on the quality of pseudo-labels.
Inaccurate pseudo-labels can introduce bias, leading to suboptimal models.To
balance the contributions of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we utilize an
interpolation parameter and tune it on the fly, alongside the model parameters,
using a one-dimensional online learning algorithm. We verify the practical
advantage of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating improved performance over classic SSL baselines and PPI
methods that tune the interpolation parameter offline.

Abstract: Geometric data analysis and learning has emerged as a distinct and rapidly
developing research area, increasingly recognized for its effectiveness across
diverse applications. At the heart of this field lies curvature, a powerful and
interpretable concept that captures intrinsic geometric structure and underpins
numerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide
range of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data
representations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and
point clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient
characterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in
geometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their
mathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical
applications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete
curvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a
systematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis. We further examine the
corresponding computational algorithms across different data representations,
offering detailed comparisons and insights. Finally, we review state-of-the-art
applications of curvature in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This
survey provides a conceptual and practical roadmap for researchers to gain a
better understanding of discrete curvature as a fundamental tool for geometric
understanding and learning.

TL;DR: CLEANet是一个针对受污染多元时间序列的鲁棒高效异常检测框架，通过污染弹性训练框架和轻量级共轭MLP解决训练数据污染和模型推理效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多元时间序列异常检测面临两个关键挑战：训练数据污染（噪声和隐藏异常）以及低效的模型推理。现有无监督方法假设训练数据干净，但污染会扭曲学习模式并降低检测精度，同时复杂深度模型容易过拟合污染数据且延迟高。

Method: 提出CLEANet框架，包含污染弹性训练框架（CRTF），通过自适应重构加权策略结合聚类引导的对比学习来减轻污染样本影响；设计轻量级共轭MLP来解耦时间和跨特征依赖关系，避免过拟合并提高计算效率。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上，CLEANet相比十个最先进基线方法实现了高达73.04%的F1提升和81.28%的运行时间降低。将CRTF集成到三个先进模型中平均获得5.35%的F1增益。

Conclusion: CLEANet有效解决了多元时间序列异常检测中的数据污染和效率问题，具有强大的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining
the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by
two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden
anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods
assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and
degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to
contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address
these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection
framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a
Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of
corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy
combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing
robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve
computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that
disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public
datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime
compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF
into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its
strong generalizability.

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual
understanding and query response generation, but often face challenges of high
computational cost and inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. In
this work, we introduce an imitation-learning-based Self-Speculative Decoding
(SSD) framework, named FastVLM, to address these limitations. Our approach
employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive
manner, while a full model verifies these tokens non-autoregressively. Accepted
tokens proceed seamlessly, while rejected tokens are corrected by the full
model and used to guide the draft model's refinement. Through an imitation
network, FastVLM enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights
from the full model's architecture. Also, it maintains the performance
integrity of the full model while training the draft model, achieving a balance
between efficiency and accuracy. Our method speeds up the inference process by
1.55-1.85x as compared to the final layer with minimal loss in performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range
of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in
graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification.
While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work
investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness.
We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum,
average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and
identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph
structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular
Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant
singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level
representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and
interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed
pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power
iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool
provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean
accuracy. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Density estimation is essential for generative modeling, particularly with
the rise of modern neural networks. While existing methods capture complex data
distributions, they often lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification.
Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially the \polya tree, offer a robust
framework that addresses these issues by accurately capturing function behavior
over small intervals. Traditional techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) face high computational complexity and scalability limitations,
hindering the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods in deep learning. To tackle
this, we introduce the variational \polya tree (VPT) model, which employs
stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions. This model
provides a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian prior that captures latent
densities and works well with stochastic gradient optimization. We also
leverage the joint distribution likelihood for a more precise variational
posterior approximation than traditional mean-field methods. We evaluate the
model performance on both real data and images, and demonstrate its
competitiveness with other state-of-the-art deep density estimation methods. We
also explore its ability in enhancing interpretability and uncertainty
quantification. Code is available at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their
vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies
focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing
schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of
weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs,
on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the
connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to
adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between
initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability,
offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense
mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical
framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.
Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets
subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate
that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean
datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations,
with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization
approaches.

*Ilgam Latypov,Alexandra Suvorikova,Alexey Kroshnin,Alexander Gasnikov,Yuriy Dorn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了M-LCB算法，用于在预算限制下同时训练多个自适应专家，提供有界遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在在线学习环境中，系统需要动态选择多个自适应学习算法但受限于训练预算的问题，如流式模型选择、金融交易策略切换等场景。

Method: 提出了M-LCB算法，这是一种高效的UCB风格元算法，使用置信区间构建，直接基于实际损失，无需额外优化，并能反映底层专家的收敛特性。

Result: 如果每个专家实现内部遗憾O~(T^α)，则M-LCB确保整体遗憾为O~(√(KT/M) + (K/M)^(1-α)T^α)。

Conclusion: 这是首个在每轮预算约束下同时训练多个自适应专家时建立遗憾保证的结果，将经典bandit范式扩展到资源有限下协调有状态自学习专家的更现实场景。

Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several
adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model
selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in
finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning
agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive
experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of
them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce
\algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that
provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built
directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and
seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If
each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB}
ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\;
(K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees
when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round
budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases:
(i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts
that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how
\algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic
scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited
resources.

Motivation: 传统自监督学习依赖手工设计的数据增强，这需要领域知识且会限制模型的泛化能力。本文旨在开发一种不依赖数据增强的表示学习方法。

Method: 使用正交基和超完备框架生成视图，利用不同表示空间的几何特性来学习嵌入表示，避免传统数据增强的局限性。

Result: 在5个时间序列任务的9个数据集上验证，相比现有自监督方法性能提升15-20%，且无需依赖数据增强带来的多样性。

Conclusion: 通过利用正交和超完备空间的互补几何特性，可以有效地学习表示而无需依赖传统数据增强，在具有挑战性的时间序列任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on
strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse
views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations
requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational
invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we
propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces
augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete
frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete
spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced
by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the
complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves
superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through
strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine
datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific
characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without
relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance
gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches. Source code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出FlowCritic方法，使用流匹配技术建模价值分布，通过生成样本进行价值估计，解决了传统方法在价值分布表达上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的价值估计是强化学习的基石，但现有方法如多评论家集成仅结合点估计，分布强化学习依赖离散化或分位数回归，限制了复杂价值分布的表达能力。

Method: FlowCritic采用生成范式，利用流匹配技术建模价值分布并生成样本进行价值估计，区别于传统的确定性价值预测回归方法。

Result: 该方法能够更好地表达复杂的价值分布，提高价值函数估计的可靠性。

Conclusion: 流匹配技术在价值估计中具有潜力，FlowCritic为强化学习中的价值分布建模提供了新的生成式解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable value estimation serves as the cornerstone of reinforcement learning
(RL) by evaluating long-term returns and guiding policy improvement,
significantly influencing the convergence speed and final performance. Existing
works improve the reliability of value function estimation via multi-critic
ensembles and distributional RL, yet the former merely combines multi point
estimation without capturing distributional information, whereas the latter
relies on discretization or quantile regression, limiting the expressiveness of
complex value distributions. Inspired by flow matching's success in generative
modeling, we propose a generative paradigm for value estimation, named
FlowCritic. Departing from conventional regression for deterministic value
prediction, FlowCritic leverages flow matching to model value distributions and
generate samples for value estimation.

TL;DR: S-Chain是首个大规模医学视觉语言推理数据集，包含12,000张专家标注的医学图像，提供结构化视觉链式思维(SV-CoT)，明确将视觉区域与推理步骤关联，支持16种语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型需要准确的预测和透明的视觉证据对齐，但缺乏大规模专家级的分步推理数据集来支持精确的视觉基础。

Method: 构建S-Chain数据集，包含边界框和结构化视觉CoT，使用该数据集对医学和通用VLMs进行基准测试，并研究其与检索增强生成的协同作用。

Result: SV-CoT监督显著提高了可解释性、基础保真度和鲁棒性，揭示了领域知识和视觉基础在自回归推理中的相互作用。

Conclusion: S-Chain为基于基础的医学推理设立了新基准，为更可信和可解释的医学VLMs铺平了道路。

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only
accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales
and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise
in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset
has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce
S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical
images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly
linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16
languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability.
Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med,
LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that
SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity,
and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with
retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual
grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning,
improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark
for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and
explainable medical VLMs.

Result: 在WebArena-Lite基准测试中达到63%成功率，优于之前最佳方法的53.9%

Conclusion: 模块化架构无需网站特定的LLM微调，世界模型、分层规划和前瞻重规划在系统设计中发挥互补作用

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively
adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which
they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the
structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we
introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action
Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a
model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in
cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a
lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner
proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in
cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and
update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On
the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%
success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous
systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning.
Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and
look-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the
design of our system

TL;DR: 论文提出Centrum，一种基于梯度提升集成和保形推断的新型DBMS自动调优器，解决了传统GP-BO和树集成BO在数据库性能调优中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GP-BO在DBMS自动调优中存在基本假设被广泛违反的问题，而现有树集成BO限制了DBMS自动调优的进一步发展，需要更先进的分布无关估计方法。

Method: 采用两阶段学习的随机梯度提升集成进行分布无关的点估计和区间估计，并结合广义SGBE估计的局部自适应保形预测来实现分布无关的不确定性估计和采集函数。

Result: 在两个DBMS和三个工作负载上的广泛物理和仿真实验表明，Centrum优于21种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Centrum是首个实现分布无关性的自动调优器，首次无缝融合了梯度提升集成和保形推断，显著提升了BO在DBMS自动调优中的实用性。

Abstract: Gaussian-Process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), is a prevailing
model-based framework for DBMS auto-tuning. However, recent work shows
GP-BO-based DBMS auto-tuners significantly outperformed auto-tuners based on
SMAC, which features random forest surrogate models; such results motivate us
to rethink and investigate the limitations of GP-BO in auto-tuner design. We
find the fundamental assumptions of GP-BO are widely violated when modeling and
optimizing DBMS performance, while tree-ensemble-BOs (e.g., SMAC) can avoid the
assumption pitfalls and deliver improved tuning efficiency and effectiveness.
Moreover, we argue that existing tree-ensemble-BOs restrict further advancement
in DBMS auto-tuning. First, existing tree-ensemble-BOs can only achieve
distribution-free point estimates, but still impose unrealistic distributional
assumptions on uncertainty estimates, compromising surrogate modeling and
distort the acquisition function. Second, recent advances in gradient boosting,
which can further enhance surrogate modeling against vanilla GP and random
forest counterparts, have rarely been applied in optimizing DBMS auto-tuners.
To address these issues, we propose a novel model-based DBMS auto-tuner,
Centrum. Centrum improves distribution-free point and interval estimation in
surrogate modeling with a two-phase learning procedure of stochastic gradient
boosting ensembles. Moreover, Centrum adopts a generalized SGBE-estimated
locally-adaptive conformal prediction to facilitate a distribution-free
uncertainty estimation and acquisition function. To our knowledge, Centrum is
the first auto-tuner to realize distribution-freeness, enhancing BO's
practicality in DBMS auto-tuning, and the first to seamlessly fuse gradient
boosting ensembles and conformal inference in BO. Extensive physical and
simulation experiments on two DBMSs and three workloads show Centrum
outperforms 21 SOTA methods.

TL;DR: 提出基于扩散模型的分布鲁棒优化方法D-DRO，通过扩散模型构建歧义集，在保持与名义分布一致性的同时捕获超出名义支持空间的对抗分布，实现更好的OOD泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DRO方法需要设计既与名义分布一致又能覆盖各种潜在场景的歧义集，同时保证优化问题的可解性。现有方法在捕获超出名义支持空间的对抗分布方面存在局限。

Method: 提出扩散模型驱动的歧义集设计，通过参数化扩散模型空间构建歧义集，并在此基础上开发D-DRO算法，求解内层最大化问题。

Result: 理论证明了D-DRO的平稳收敛性能，在机器学习预测任务中实证展示了其优越的分布外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的DRO框架能够有效增强统计学习和优化的鲁棒性和泛化能力，特别是在处理超出训练分布的数据时表现优异。

Abstract: This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental
framework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical
learning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve
distributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being
diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it
should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a
diffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial
distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency
with the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose
Diffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner
maximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally
establish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically
demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance
in a ML prediction task.

TL;DR: TALE是一种推理时算法，通过直接优化任务特定验证性能来剪枝整个Transformer层，无需重新训练即可提高准确性并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在剪枝Transformer层时往往需要重新训练，且不能保证任务性能的提升。TALE旨在通过直接优化任务特定性能来实现无需重新训练的层剪枝。

Method: TALE在推理时根据任务特定验证性能直接剪枝整个Transformer层，无需模型重新训练。该方法还可在微调过程中应用以获得额外性能提升。

Result: 在9个任务和5个模型上的评估显示，TALE在所有基准测试中一致提高准确性并减少计算成本，在零样本和少样本设置下均有效。

Conclusion: TALE通过选择性层移除解决了某些层作为瓶颈的问题，产生了更小、更快、更准确的模型，同时为Transformer可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an
inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by
directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9
tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral
7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior
approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy
while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying
TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE
provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks,
degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal
remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that
are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer
interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出SeeDNorm动态归一化方法，通过基于输入动态调整缩放系数来增强模型表示能力，在保持RMSNorm优点的同时解决其丢弃输入范数信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMSNorm归一化层丢弃了输入范数信息，且静态缩放系数难以适应输入数据的广泛变化和分布偏移，特别是在大语言模型的零样本场景中限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出SeeDNorm方法，基于当前输入动态调整缩放系数，保留输入范数信息，实现数据依赖的自重缩放动态归一化，同时保持RMSNorm在反向传播中根据输入范数动态调整梯度的能力。

Result: 在大语言模型预训练以及监督和无监督计算机视觉任务中，SeeDNorm在不同规模模型上均取得优于RMSNorm、LayerNorm和DyT等方法的性能，且仅引入极少参数，对模型效率影响可忽略。

Conclusion: SeeDNorm通过动态调整缩放系数有效提升了模型表示能力，在各种任务中均表现出优于现有归一化方法的性能，为解决归一化层在动态数据环境中的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In
transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit
hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling
coefficient $\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model.
However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a
static scaling factor $\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide
variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further
performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large
language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose
SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by
dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input,
thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent,
self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains
the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input
norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm
and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues
that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of
SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as
well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a
minimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency,
SeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously
commonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as
element-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.

Conclusion: 基于图的推荐中的归纳迁移是可行的，交互级消息传递支持跨数据集泛化，无需对齐的用户或物品。

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems are commonly trained in transductive
settings, which limits their applicability to new users, items, or datasets. We
propose NBF-Rec, a graph-based recommendation model that supports inductive
transfer learning across datasets with disjoint user and item sets. Unlike
conventional embedding-based methods that require retraining for each domain,
NBF-Rec computes node embeddings dynamically at inference time. We evaluate the
method on seven real-world datasets spanning movies, music, e-commerce, and
location check-ins. NBF-Rec achieves competitive performance in zero-shot
settings, where no target domain data is used for training, and demonstrates
further improvements through lightweight fine-tuning. These results show that
inductive transfer is feasible in graph-based recommendation and that
interaction-level message passing supports generalization across datasets
without requiring aligned users or items.

Conclusion: 所提算法在随机通信图上实现了接近最优的性能，数值实验验证了理论结果，并展示了算法相对于现有基准的优越性。

Abstract: We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with
heterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time
step $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by
applying the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for
classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each
potential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link
probability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily
connected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant
distributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across
agents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the
global mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean
rewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed
algorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip
algorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\log
T$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the
optimal centralized regret $O\left(\sum_{k: \Delta_k>0} \frac{\log
T}{\Delta_k}\right)$ and an additional term $O\left(\frac{N^2 \log T}{p
\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \frac{KN^2 \log T}{p}\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote
the total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the
impact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link
probability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between
communication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal
regret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the
superiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the
theoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度大城市空气质量问题严重，污染物水平突然飙升给及时干预带来挑战，而AQI预测因同时存在线性趋势、季节变化和波动非线性模式而难以准确预测。

Method: 使用LOESS分解将AQI序列分离为趋势、季节和残差分量，ARIMA建模平滑分量，提出的深度学习模块捕捉残差中的多尺度波动，通过UAMMO优化器调整超参数。

Result: 在2021-2023年AQI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在PM2.5、O3、CO和NOx等多个污染物指标上均优于统计、深度学习和混合基线方法，MSE降低5-8%，R^2得分>0.94。

Conclusion: 该框架具有鲁棒性，对突发污染事件敏感，适用于城市空气质量管理的实际应用。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical environmental and public health concern in
Indian megacities such as Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, where sudden spikes in
pollutant levels challenge timely intervention. Accurate Air Quality Index
(AQI) forecasting is difficult due to the coexistence of linear trends,
seasonal variations, and volatile nonlinear patterns. This paper proposes a
hybrid forecasting framework that integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA
modeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention
mechanism. The LOESS step separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and
residual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the proposed
deep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Model
hyperparameters are tuned via the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic
Optimizer (UAMMO), combining multiple optimization strategies for efficient
convergence. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from the Central Pollution
Control Board show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines across PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx
in three major cities, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R^2 scores
(>0.94) for all pollutants. These results demonstrate the framework's
robustness, sensitivity to sudden pollution events, and applicability to urban
air quality management.

Method: 使用与BOBW FTRL算法1/2-Tsallis-INF相关的正则函数Ψ(p)=-4∑√p_i定义的Bregman散度，分析其在最优臂上的点质量与臂集概率分布之间的收敛速率。

Result: 理论分析表明，Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}的速率衰减，部分证实了对数遗憾应该对应t^{-1}末轮收敛速率的直觉。

Conclusion: 该研究部分验证了对数遗憾与末轮收敛速率之间的直觉关系，为FTRL算法在赌博机问题中的末轮收敛性提供了理论保证。

Abstract: The convergence analysis of online learning algorithms is central to machine
learning theory, where last-iterate convergence is particularly important, as
it captures the learner's actual decisions and describes the evolution of the
learning process over time. However, in multi-armed bandits, most existing
algorithmic analyses mainly focus on the order of regret, while the
last-iterate (simple regret) convergence rate remains less explored --
especially for the widely studied Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)
algorithms. Recently, a growing line of work has established the
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) property of FTRL algorithms in bandit problems,
showing in particular that they achieve logarithmic regret in stochastic
bandits. Nevertheless, their last-iterate convergence rate has not yet been
studied. Intuitively, logarithmic regret should correspond to a $t^{-1}$
last-iterate convergence rate. This paper partially confirms this intuition
through theoretical analysis, showing that the Bregman divergence, defined by
the regular function $\Psi(p)=-4\sum_{i=1}^{d}\sqrt{p_i}$ associated with the
BOBW FTRL algorithm $1/2$-Tsallis-INF (arXiv:1807.07623), between the point
mass on the optimal arm and the probability distribution over the arm set
obtained at iteration $t$, decays at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.

*Mirco A. Mannucci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOGAN框架将GAN训练与逻辑约束相结合，通过有界深度的Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé博弈来确保生成样本满足目标理论T的逻辑属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合GAN的不可区分性和逻辑解释性，在有限计算预算下实现可验证的样本生成，提供可解释的失败原因和可控的生成过程。

Method: 使用深度k的EF博弈：判别器作为对手寻找逻辑错误，生成器作为构建者生成能通过k轮匹配的目标理论样本；配备EF探针模拟器和MSO图检查器。

Result: 仿真验证达到92%-98%属性满足率，真实神经网络GAN训练在挑战性属性上提升5%-14%，连通性达到98%满足率。

Conclusion: LOGAN提供了一个紧凑、可复现的逻辑有界生成路径，具有可解释失败、经过验证的有效性（仿真和真实训练）和可控参数。

Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a
budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a
generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN}
(LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e
(EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles,
nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays
\emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target
theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style
graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with
PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that
mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a
practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$
property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training
achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$
satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning
(Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation
with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real
training), and dials for control.

Motivation: 现有离散扩散模型使用仅解码器架构，需要在每个去噪步骤调用完整网络，计算成本高。需要更高效的推理方法。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构：编码器表示干净令牌，轻量级解码器迭代优化噪声序列。支持块扩散模型训练，包含专用训练和采样算法。

Result: 在摘要、翻译和数学推理任务上，E2D2在生成质量和推理吞吐量之间实现了优越的权衡。

Conclusion: E2D2框架通过专门的编码器-解码器架构显著加速离散扩散模型推理，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models enable parallel token sampling for faster inference
than autoregressive approaches. However, prior diffusion models use a
decoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the
full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key
insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1)
representing clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us
to use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder
architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an
encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively
refine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster
training of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for
better quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We
introduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2),
consisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling
algorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between
generation quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and
mathematical reasoning tasks. We provide the code, model weights, and blog post

Abstract: Precipitation prediction has undergone a profound transformation -- from
early symbolic and empirical methods rooted in divination and observation, to
modern technologies based on atmospheric physics and artificial intelligence.
This review traces the historical and technological evolution of precipitation
forecasting, presenting a survey about end-to-end precipitation prediction
technologies that spans ancient practices, the foundations of meteorological
science, the rise of numerical weather prediction (NWP), and the emergence of
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. We first explore
traditional and indigenous forecasting methods, then describe the development
of physical modeling and statistical frameworks that underpin contemporary
operational forecasting. Particular emphasis is placed on recent advances in
neural network-based approaches, including automated deep learning,
interpretability-driven design, and hybrid physical-data models. By compositing
research across multiple eras and paradigms, this review not only depicts the
history of end-to-end precipitation prediction but also outlines future
directions in next generation forecasting systems.

TL;DR: RLPD-GX是一个混合离线-在线强化学习框架，通过将策略优化与安全执行解耦来解决分布偏移问题。奖励寻求的学习器自由探索，而基于投影的守护器保证规则一致执行和安全价值备份。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合离线-在线强化学习结合了样本效率和鲁棒探索的优势，但由于离线与在线数据之间的分布偏移而存在不稳定性问题。

Method: 采用解耦设计：奖励寻求学习器自由探索，投影守护器确保安全执行；提出动态课程学习，逐步扩展时间范围并退火离线-在线数据混合。

Result: 在Atari-100k上达到3.02的归一化平均分数（比先前混合方法提升45%），具有更强的安全性和稳定性；在其他安全关键和长视野任务上也表现一致。

Conclusion: 解耦的安全执行为鲁棒混合离线-在线强化学习提供了一个简单而有原则的途径，为在强化学习中调和探索与安全提出了更广泛的范式。

Abstract: Hybrid offline--online reinforcement learning (O2O RL) promises both sample
efficiency and robust exploration, but suffers from instability due to
distribution shift between offline and online data. We introduce RLPD-GX, a
framework that decouples policy optimization from safety enforcement: a
reward-seeking learner explores freely, while a projection-based guardian
guarantees rule-consistent execution and safe value backups. This design
preserves the exploratory value of online interactions without collapsing to
conservative policies. To further stabilize training, we propose dynamic
curricula that gradually extend temporal horizons and anneal offline--online
data mixing. We prove convergence via a contraction property of the guarded
Bellman operator, and empirically show state-of-the-art performance on
Atari-100k, achieving a normalized mean score of 3.02 (+45\% over prior hybrid
methods) with stronger safety and stability. Beyond Atari, ablations
demonstrate consistent gains across safety-critical and long-horizon tasks,
underscoring the generality of our design. Extensive and comprehensive results
highlight decoupled safety enforcement as a simple yet principled route to
robust O2O RL, suggesting a broader paradigm for reconciling exploration and
safety in reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合动态时间规整和CNN-GRU架构的深度学习框架，用于PM2.5长期预测，在稀疏监测网络城市中实现稳定10天预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在48小时后预测稳定性不足，特别是在监测网络稀疏的城市中，无法满足公共卫生预警系统的长期预测需求。

Method: 使用DTW进行智能站点相似性选择，结合轻量级CNN-GRU架构，并整合气象特征，为稀疏网络优化的可扩展设计。

Result: 在伊朗伊斯法罕8个监测站的多年度小时数据验证中，24小时预测R2=0.91，首次实现稳定10天预测（240小时R2=0.73），性能优于现有深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该框架计算效率高且不依赖外部工具，特别适合资源受限的城市环境部署，解决了关键预警系统需求。

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is critical for public
health early-warning systems, yet existing deep learning approaches struggle to
maintain prediction stability beyond 48 hours, especially in cities with sparse
monitoring networks. This paper presents a deep learning framework that
combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for intelligent station similarity
selection with a CNN-GRU architecture to enable extended-horizon PM2.5
forecasting in Isfahan, Iran, a city characterized by complex pollution
dynamics and limited monitoring coverage. Unlike existing approaches that rely
on computationally intensive transformer models or external simulation tools,
our method integrates three key innovations: (i) DTW-based historical sampling
to identify similar pollution patterns across peer stations, (ii) a lightweight
CNN-GRU architecture augmented with meteorological features, and (iii) a
scalable design optimized for sparse networks. Experimental validation using
multi-year hourly data from eight monitoring stations demonstrates superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving R2 =
0.91 for 24-hour forecasts. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate
stable 10-day PM2.5 forecasting (R2 = 0.73 at 240 hours) without performance
degradation, addressing critical early-warning system requirements. The
framework's computational efficiency and independence from external tools make
it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained urban
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证基础模型在医疗表型发现中的有效性，特别是测试这些模型是否能生成既统计真实又临床相关的患者轨迹数据。

Method: 使用LSTM和简化Transformer两种自回归模型，在HIV抗逆转录病毒治疗和急性低血压数据集上进行训练，通过添加随机访视间隔引入受控不规则性，评估患者轨迹合成的分布和相关性保真度。

Result: 两种模型都能重现特征分布，但都无法保持跨特征结构，表明生成式预训练只能实现局部真实性而缺乏临床连贯性。

Conclusion: 强调需要领域特定的评估方法，并支持将轨迹合成作为微调或部署前的实用测试手段。

Abstract: Foundation models refer to architectures trained on vast datasets using
autoregressive pre-training from natural language processing to capture
intricate patterns and motifs. They were originally developed to transfer such
learned knowledge to downstream predictive tasks. Recently, however, some
studies repurpose these learned representations for phenotype discovery without
rigorous validation, risking superficially realistic but clinically incoherent
embeddings. To test this mismatch, we trained two autoregressive models -- a
sequence-to-sequence LSTM and a reduced Transformer -- on longitudinal ART for
HIV and Acute Hypotension datasets. Controlled irregularity was added during
training via random inter-visit gaps, while test sequences stayed complete.
Patient-trajectory synthesis evaluated distributional and correlational
fidelity. Both reproduced feature distributions but failed to preserve
cross-feature structure -- showing that generative pre-training yields local
realism but limited clinical coherence. These results highlight the need for
domain-specific evaluation and support trajectory synthesis as a practical
probe before fine-tuning or deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多模态联邦学习经常遇到客户端数据不完整和异构的问题，导致局部特征表示错位，限制了模型聚合的效果。

Method: 使用基于可学习客户端嵌入控制的局部自适应表示，这些嵌入编码了每个客户端的数据缺失模式，作为重新配置信号来对齐全局聚合表示与局部上下文。

Result: 在多个联邦多模态基准测试中，该方法在严重数据不完整情况下实现了高达36.45%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过客户端嵌入控制有效解决了多模态联邦学习中的数据缺失和异构问题，理论分析和实证结果均验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning in real-world settings often encounters
incomplete and heterogeneous data across clients. This results in misaligned
local feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model
aggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets
without missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features
across clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each
client observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing
input features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in
learned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework
featuring locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side
embedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.
  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally
aggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more
effective use of shared information. Furthermore, the embedding controls can be
algorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to
enhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global
representation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks
with diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\% performance improvement under
severe data incompleteness. The method is also supported by a theoretical
analysis with an explicit performance bound that matches our empirical
observations. Our source codes are provided at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于最大边际似然(MML)的对齐方法MMPO，该方法通过最大化首选文本输出的边际对数似然来替代复杂的RLHF，无需显式奖励模型和熵最大化，在保持模型通用语言能力的同时实现竞争性偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的人类偏好对齐方法如RLHF通常复杂且不稳定，需要寻找更简单有效的替代方案。

Method: 基于最大边际似然估计重新构建对齐问题，提出MMPO方法，使用偏好对作为近似样本，最大化首选文本的边际对数似然。

Result: 在135M到8B参数的模型上验证，MMPO对超参数β更稳定，在保持基础模型通用语言能力的同时实现竞争性或更优的偏好对齐效果。

Conclusion: MMPO通过梯度更新中的隐式偏好优化实现了有效且稳定的对齐，是一种有前景的替代方法。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial, but
standard methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are
often complex and unstable. In this work, we propose a new, simpler approach
that recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML)
estimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the
marginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair
as samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward
model and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO
implicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that
naturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging
from 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable
with respect to the hyperparameter $\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,
and 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better
preserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of
ablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed
attributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient
updates.

Abstract: Linguistic Landscape (LL) research traditionally relies on manual photography
and annotation of public signages to examine distribution of languages in urban
space. While such methods yield valuable findings, the process is
time-consuming and difficult for large study areas. This study explores the use
of AI powered language detection method to automate LL analysis. Using Honolulu
Chinatown as a case study, we constructed a georeferenced photo dataset of
1,449 images collected by researchers and applied AI for optical character
recognition (OCR) and language classification. We also conducted manual
validations for accuracy checking. This model achieved an overall accuracy of
79%. Five recurring types of mislabeling were identified, including distortion,
reflection, degraded surface, graffiti, and hallucination. The analysis also
reveals that the AI model treats all regions of an image equally, detecting
peripheral or background texts that human interpreters typically ignore.
Despite these limitations, the results demonstrate the potential of integrating
AI-assisted workflows into LL research to reduce such time-consuming processes.
However, due to all the limitations and mis-labels, we recognize that AI cannot
be fully trusted during this process. This paper encourages a hybrid approach
combining AI automation with human validation for a more reliable and efficient
workflow.

Abstract: Natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, pose significant challenges to
daily life and incur considerable global economic losses. The emergence of
next-generation small-satellites, capable of constellation-based operations,
offers unparalleled opportunities for near-real-time monitoring and onboard
processing of such events. However, a major bottleneck remains the lack of
extensive annotated datasets capturing volcanic activity, which hinders the
development of robust detection systems. This paper introduces a novel dataset
explicitly designed for volcanic activity and eruption detection, encompassing
diverse volcanoes worldwide. The dataset provides binary annotations to
identify volcanic anomalies or non-anomalies, covering phenomena such as
temperature anomalies, eruptions, and volcanic ash emissions. These annotations
offer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,
addressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we
present comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish
baselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for
deploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel
Movidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic
activity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces
latency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning
systems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster
management, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard
monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Subgraph matching is vital in knowledge graph (KG) question answering,
molecule design, scene graph, code and circuit search, etc. Neural methods have
shown promising results for subgraph matching. Our study of recent systems
suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching
networks. Existing methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space,
which remains largely uncharted. We undertake the first comprehensive
exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft
permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes
vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural
representations of the graphs. Our extensive experiments reveal that judicious
and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large
performance benefits. Beyond better performance, our study uncovers valuable
insights and establishes general design principles for neural graph
representation and interaction, which may be of wider interest.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been extended to language generation through
Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), which achieve performance competitive
with strong autoregressive models. However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the
few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation
methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic
property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models
(USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still
suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we
propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only
noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level
performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we
introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired
negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in
generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂高维数据（如无人机传感器读数）中的异常检测对操作安全至关重要，但现有方法因灵敏度有限、可扩展性不足且无法捕捉复杂依赖关系而面临挑战。

Method: DTD采用单步扩散过程预测噪声模式，基于噪声预测与数据分布评分函数关联的理论基础。集成图神经网络建模传感器关系为动态图，捕捉空间和时间异常。采用双分支架构，参数化神经网络能量评分实现可扩展性，非参数统计方法提供可解释性。

Conclusion: DTD的通用性和适应性使其成为安全关键应用（包括工业监控等）的变革性解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor
readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing
methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture
intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a
novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection,
diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference
time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict
noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without
reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical
foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score
function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural
Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively
captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch
architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for
scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability,
provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency.
Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images
demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its
generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its
adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical
applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.

*Zidong Liu,Zhuoyan Xu,Zhenmei Shi,Yingyu Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 语言模型在上下文组合任务中表现不佳，简单的任务示例可能产生负面影响，因为模型难以正确识别和组装技能，即使使用思维链示例。理论分析表明示例与组合步骤的对齐至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在上下文中的组合能力，将基本技能从简单任务组合成复合任务，这对现代智能系统至关重要。这比标准设置更具挑战性，因为技能及其组合需要在训练中学习。

Method: 对多个代表性开源语言模型进行系统实验，使用语言和逻辑任务来探究组合能力，包括使用思维链示例。理论分析强调示例与组合步骤对齐的重要性。

Result: 实验结果显示简单任务示例对性能有负面影晌，模型普遍难以正确识别和组装技能。理论分析验证了示例对齐的重要性，并启发了一种改进的探测任务方法。

Conclusion: 语言模型在上下文组合任务中存在困难，示例与组合步骤的对齐是提升性能的关键因素。改进的方法为这一洞察提供了积极支持。

Abstract: Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is
crucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context
composition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine
basic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than
the standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in
training. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative
open-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to
probe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can
have a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models
generally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with
Chain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is
crucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition. This
inspires a method for the probing tasks, whose improved performance provides
positive support for our insights.

### [356] [Robust Uncertainty Quantification for Self-Evolving Large Language Models via Continual Domain Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22931)
*Xiaofan Zhou,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应拒绝和非交换性共形预测框架，用于解决持续领域预训练中LLMs的统计可靠性问题，通过领域分布估计和自适应拒绝机制提升预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习对LLMs适应知识增长至关重要，但缺乏统计可靠性保证。传统共形预测在持续领域预训练中面临分布偏移和预测集过大的挑战。

Method: 使用基于transformer的聚类估计测试集问题分布，重新加权或重采样校准数据，结合自适应拒绝机制让LLM在置信度显著变化时选择弃答。

Result: 大量实验表明该框架在持续领域预训练场景下显著提升了共形预测的有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应拒绝和非交换性共形预测框架成功解决了持续领域预训练中的统计可靠性问题，为LLMs的持续学习提供了有效的可靠性保证。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is essential for enabling self-evolving large
language models (LLMs) to adapt and remain effective amid rapid knowledge
growth. Yet, despite its importance, little attention has been given to
establishing statistical reliability guarantees for LLMs under CL, particularly
in the setting of continual domain pretraining (CDP). Conformal Prediction (CP)
has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces
major challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting
domain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees.
Moreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large
prediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address
these challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP
framework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across
domains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or
resamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive
rejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its
confidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability
of CP under CDP scenarios. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习研究主要关注密集模型，而MoE架构的RL训练研究不足，且存在训练不稳定的问题。

Method: 设计了一种router-aware的重要性采样权重优化方法，采用基于路由器logits的重新缩放策略来降低梯度方差。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著提高了MoE模型的收敛稳定性和最终性能。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了针对MoE架构的RL算法创新的潜力，为大规模专家模型的高效训练提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved
the training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in
generation quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research
focuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly
observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize
importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a
rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient
variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the
final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic
innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction
for efficient training of large-scale expert models.

### [358] [RL-AUX: Reinforcement Learning for Auxiliary Task Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22940)
*Judah Goldfeder,Matthew So,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的辅助任务动态生成方法，避免传统方法中的双层优化问题，并在CIFAR100数据集上取得了优于人工标注辅助任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辅助学习需要人工标注的辅助任务，这需要大量人力和领域专业知识。现有的元学习方法虽然能自动生成辅助任务，但依赖计算成本高的双层优化。本文旨在探索更高效的辅助任务生成方法。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，RL代理为训练集中的每个数据点选择辅助标签，当选择能提升主任务性能时获得奖励。同时实验了学习每个数据点辅助损失权重的最优策略。

Result: 在20-Superclass CIFAR100问题上，RL方法优于人工标注的辅助任务，与主流双层优化技术性能相当。权重学习方法显著优于所有基准方法，VGG16架构达到80.9%测试准确率，而人工方法为75.53%。

Conclusion: 强化学习是动态生成辅助任务的有效方法，同时学习每个样本的辅助任务权重可以取得更好的结果，避免了传统方法中的计算复杂性问题。

Abstract: Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a special case of Multi-task Learning (MTL) in
which a network trains on auxiliary tasks to improve performance on its main
task. This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately,
performance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve
performance across multiple domains, including navigation, image
classification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need
for labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain
expertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this
issue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can
create helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques
rely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased
code complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an
RL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an
RL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a
training set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the
performance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal
strategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass
CIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and
performs as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight
learning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For
example, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve
80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved
75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to
dynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample
auxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and
can achieve strong results.

*Chi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从信息论角度重新解释了GSPO算法中的长度归一化重要性权重，揭示了其与困惑度比率和交叉熵变化之间的数学等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为GSPO算法中的序列级权重提供信息论解释，帮助理解该算法的经验特性，包括对数域方差减少和混合专家模型训练的稳定性。

Method: 通过建立GSPO序列级权重与困惑度比率和交叉熵变化的数学等价关系，从信息论角度重新解释重要性权重。

Result: 证明了GSPO的序列级权重可以等价表示为困惑度比率和交叉熵变化的指数形式，验证了数学等价性和方差预测。

Conclusion: 信息论视角为理解GSPO算法提供了有用的框架，能够解释其经验特性，并通过数学推理任务验证了理论预测。

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on GSPO's length-normalized importance ratios by
establishing their connection to information-theoretic quantities. We show that
GSPO's sequence-level weight $s(\theta) =
(\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$ can be equivalently expressed
as the inverse perplexity ratio
$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$ and as the exponential
cross-entropy change $\exp(\Delta H)$. While the perplexity-entropy
relationship follows from standard definitions, this observation provides a
useful lens for understanding GSPO: the algorithm weights policy gradient
updates by perplexity ratios, offering an information-theoretic interpretation
of the importance weights. This perspective helps explain GSPO's empirical
properties, including log-domain variance reduction through geometric averaging
and stability in training mixture-of-experts models. We validate the
mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled
experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks.

### [360] [Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin for Climate-Driven Urban Resilience and Equity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22941)
*Zhenglai Shen,Hongyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种灾害响应数字孪生(H-RDT)系统，结合物理信息神经网络、多模态数据融合和公平感知风险分析，用于城市级灾害响应。在模拟的野火-停电-热浪连锁灾害中，该系统能维持稳定的室内温度预测，并通过强化学习自适应融合物联网、无人机和卫星数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合气候灾害（如野火引发的停电和城市热浪）对城市稳定性和公平性构成挑战，需要开发能够整合物理灾害建模与社会公平的决策支持系统。

Method: 采用物理信息神经网络建模、多模态数据融合和公平感知风险分析，结合强化学习自适应重加权物联网、无人机和卫星输入，维持时空覆盖。

Result: 在部分传感器失效情况下，H-RDT能维持稳定的室内温度预测（约31-33°C），再现停电驱动的温度激增和恢复。前瞻性干预措施（如预防性冷却中心激活和微电网共享）使人口加权热风险降低11-13%，尾部风险降低7-17%，过热小时数减少达9%。

Conclusion: H-RDT为实际城市实施建立了可转移的基础，将物理灾害建模与社会公平和决策智能联系起来，推动数字城市韧性向自适应、基于学习和以公平为中心的决策支持发展。

Abstract: Compounding climate hazards, such as wildfire-induced outages and urban
heatwaves, challenge the stability and equity of cities. We present a
Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin (H-RDT) that combines physics-informed neural
network modeling, multimodal data fusion, and equity-aware risk analytics for
urban-scale response. In a synthetic district with diverse building archetypes
and populations, a simulated wildfire-outage-heatwave cascade shows that H-RDT
maintains stable indoor temperature predictions (approximately 31 to 33 C)
under partial sensor loss, reproducing outage-driven surges and recovery. The
reinforcement learning based fusion module adaptively reweights IoT, UAV, and
satellite inputs to sustain spatiotemporal coverage, while the equity-adjusted
mapping isolates high-vulnerability clusters (schools, clinics, low-income
housing). Prospective interventions, such as preemptive cooling-center
activation and microgrid sharing, reduce population-weighted thermal risk by 11
to 13 percent, shrink the 95th-percentile (tail) risk by 7 to 17 percent, and
cut overheating hours by up to 9 percent. Beyond the synthetic demonstration,
the framework establishes a transferable foundation for real-city
implementation, linking physical hazard modeling with social equity and
decision intelligence. The H-RDT advances digital urban resilience toward
adaptive, learning-based, and equity-centered decision support for climate
adaptation.

### [361] [PTPP-Aware Adaptation Scaling Laws: Predicting Domain-Adaptation Performance at Unseen Pre-Training Budgets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23198)
*Etienne Goffinet,Shane Bergsma,Avraham Sheinin,Natalia Vassilieva,Shaheer Muhammad,Preslav Nakov,Gurpreet Gosal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了PTPP感知的自适应缩放定律，将预训练预算作为显式变量，能够准确预测未见PTPP值的自适应损失，并在多语言设置中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续预训练缩放定律通常假设固定的预训练预算，这限制了它们预测在不同tokens-per-parameter(PTPP)下训练的模型自适应结果的能力。

Method: 提出PTPP感知的自适应缩放定律，使预训练预算成为显式变量，并在多语言设置（英语/阿拉伯语→法语）上进行验证。

Result: 在早期阶段(PTPP={15,31})训练的PTPP感知公式能够准确预测PTPP=279时的目标损失，并在多个指标上优于PTPP不可知的DCPT传输基线。

Conclusion: PTPP感知缩放定律不仅能准确预测自适应损失，还具有实际应用价值，可以在计算限制下规划重放比率和自适应token预算以满足目标和遗忘约束。

Abstract: Continual pre-training (CPT) for domain adaptation must balance target-domain
gains with stability on the base domain. Existing CPT scaling laws typically
assume a fixed pre-training budget, which limits their ability to forecast
adaptation outcomes for models trained at different tokens-per-parameter
(PTPP). We present \emph{PTPP-aware} adaptation scaling laws that make the
pre-training budget an explicit variable, enabling accurate \emph{prediction}
of adaptation loss at unseen \ptpp. On a multilingual setup (English/Arabic
$\rightarrow$ French), PTPP-aware formulations trained on early stages
(\ptpp{}=\{15,31\}) predict target loss at \ptpp{}=279 and outperform a
PTPP-agnostic \dcpt{} transfer baseline on metrics (Huber-on-log,
MAE$_\mathrm{rel}$, calibration slope); full diagnostics (RMSE, MAPE) are in
the appendix. Beyond forecasting, we show a practical use case: planning replay
ratios and adaptation token budgets that satisfy target and forgetting
constraints under compute limits.

### [362] [Hankel Singular Value Regularization for Highly Compressible State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22951)
*Paul Schwerdtner,Jules Berman,Benjamin Peherstorfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过Hankel奇异值正则化来压缩状态空间模型的方法，使模型在保持高精度的同时压缩率提升10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于状态空间模型的深度神经网络在长序列任务中表现良好，但训练后压缩困难。需要开发有效的压缩方法。

Method: 利用状态空间模型系统矩阵的块对角结构，开发了高效计算Hankel奇异值的算法，并在训练过程中对Hankel奇异值之和进行正则化。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中，正则化的状态空间层比标准状态空间层压缩率高10倍，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: Hankel奇异值正则化是实现状态空间模型高效压缩的有效方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for
long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We
use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models
leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models.
To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop
an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training
iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system
matrices that is we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments
on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space
layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers
while maintaining high accuracy.

### [363] [SARNet: A Spike-Aware consecutive validation Framework for Accurate Remaining Useful Life Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22955)
*Junhao Fan,Wenrui Liang,Wei-Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SARNet是一种用于剩余使用寿命预测的尖峰感知连续验证框架，结合现代时序卷积网络和自适应阈值检测，提供物理可解释性并降低预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RUL预测模型在故障发生时表现脆弱且缺乏可解释性：短时高能尖峰被平滑或误读，固定阈值降低灵敏度，缺乏基于物理解释的方法。

Method: 基于ModernTCN预测退化敏感指标，使用自适应连续阈值验证真实尖峰并抑制噪声，对故障易发段进行针对性特征工程，最后通过堆叠RF-LGBM回归器生成最终RUL。

Result: 在基准数据集的事件触发协议下，SARNet相比现有基线持续降低误差（RMSE 0.0365，MAE 0.0204），同时保持轻量、鲁棒且易于部署。

Conclusion: SARNet通过尖峰感知检测和物理信息可解释性，有效提升了RUL预测的准确性和可靠性，为系统维护提供了更可靠的决策支持。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is essential to enhance
system reliability and reduce maintenance risk. Yet many strong contemporary
models are fragile around fault onset and opaque to engineers: short,
high-energy spikes are smoothed away or misread, fixed thresholds blunt
sensitivity, and physics-based explanations are scarce. To remedy this, we
introduce SARNet (Spike-Aware Consecutive Validation Framework), which builds
on a Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (ModernTCN) and adds spike-aware
detection to provide physics-informed interpretability. ModernTCN forecasts
degradation-sensitive indicators; an adaptive consecutive threshold validates
true spikes while suppressing noise. Failure-prone segments then receive
targeted feature engineering (spectral slopes, statistical derivatives, energy
ratios), and the final RUL is produced by a stacked RF--LGBM regressor. Across
benchmark-ported datasets under an event-triggered protocol, SARNet
consistently lowers error compared to recent baselines (RMSE 0.0365, MAE
0.0204) while remaining lightweight, robust, and easy to deploy.

### [364] [The Reasoning Trap: How Enhancing LLM Reasoning Amplifies Tool Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22977)
*Chenlong Yin,Zeyang Sha,Shiwen Cui,Changhua Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现增强大语言模型的推理能力会直接导致工具幻觉增加，这是一个因果关系的可靠性-能力权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前观察到更强的推理能力往往伴随着更多的幻觉，但缺乏系统研究来验证推理增强是否直接导致工具幻觉。

Method: 构建SimpleToolHalluBench诊断基准，通过控制实验研究推理增强与工具幻觉的关系，并评估缓解策略如提示工程和DPO。

Result: 推理增强与工具幻觉存在因果关系，这种效应超越过拟合，且方法无关。缓解策略显示可靠性-能力权衡：减少幻觉会降低实用性。

Conclusion: 当前推理增强方法固有地放大工具幻觉，需要新的训练目标来同时优化能力和可靠性。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key
strategy for building Agents that "think then act." However, recent
observations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often
coincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically
examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To
address this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning
increase tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,
a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)
no tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled
experiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal
relationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool
hallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect
transcends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still
amplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,
appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is
merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step
thinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering
and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental
reliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades
utility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses
tool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as
amplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These
findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify
tool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that
jointly optimize for capability and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个完全可定制和可适应的系统，用于直接从图像翻译文本，而不依赖单一的大型预训练模型。

Method: 使用U-Net模型检测图像中的文本区域，Tesseract引擎提取文本，然后通过从头训练的Transformer模型进行多语言翻译。

Result: 系统在文本检测准确性、文本识别质量和翻译性能（BLEU分数）方面表现出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: 验证了自定义构建系统直接从图像翻译文本的可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that
integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text
recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for
Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model,
trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions
from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to
extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer
model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5
languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our
architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is
evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and
translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates
promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for
translating text directly from images.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出QoSMGAA架构，通过多阶注意力机制和对抗神经网络提升QoS预测精度，在数据稀疏和噪声环境下表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络服务数量激增导致相似服务选择困难，现有QoS预测方法难以捕捉丰富上下文信息且在数据稀疏和结构噪声下性能不佳

Method: 集成多阶注意力机制聚合上下文数据，使用对抗神经网络进行自回归监督学习，采用Gumbel-Softmax离散采样技术生成负样本

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验验证表明，该模型显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: QoSMGAA在服务选择和推荐场景中具有强大的实际部署潜力

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of internet technologies, network services have
become critical for delivering diverse and reliable applications to users.
However, the exponential growth in the number of available services has
resulted in many similar offerings, posing significant challenges in selecting
optimal services. Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) accurately thus becomes a
fundamental prerequisite for ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.
However, existing QoS prediction methods often fail to capture rich contextual
information and exhibit poor performance under extreme data sparsity and
structural noise. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture, QoSMGAA,
specifically designed to enhance prediction accuracy in complex and noisy
network service environments. QoSMGAA integrates a multi-order attention
mechanism to aggregate extensive contextual data and predict missing QoS values
effectively. Additionally, our method incorporates adversarial neural networks
to perform autoregressive supervised learning based on transformed interaction
matrices. To capture complex, higher-order interactions among users and
services, we employ a discrete sampling technique leveraging the Gumbel-Softmax
method to generate informative negative samples. Comprehensive experimental
validation conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrates that our
proposed model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods,
highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment in service selection
and recommendation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准掩码扩散模型无法有效捕获并发预测token间的依赖关系，这在token依赖关系重要的场景中会导致生成质量下降。

Method: 在掩码扩散过程中引入潜变量，通过变分推断来显式建模token间的依赖关系。

Result: 在合成数据集、数独谜题和文本数据集上的实验表明，VMD成功学习了传统掩码扩散无法捕获的依赖关系，提高了生成质量和全局一致性。

Conclusion: 将变分推断集成到掩码扩散中具有重要价值，VMD框架能够增强生成质量和依赖感知能力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for
discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked
diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens
that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when
dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among
tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that
introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through
controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD
successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to
capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku
puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves
global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality
and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational
inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs)架构，实现对一般线性变换GL(n)的精确等变性，克服现有等变模型只能处理简单对称性的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有等变模型大多局限于旋转等简单对称性，无法处理科学领域中常见的广义线性变换GL(n)。需要开发能够处理更广泛对称性类别的神经网络架构。

Method: 引入ReLNs架构，设计新颖的伴随不变双线性层，实现对李代数特征和矩阵值输入的稳定等变性，无需为每个子群重新设计。

Result: 在sl(3)和sp(4)对称性的代数基准测试中优于现有方法；在洛伦兹等变粒子物理任务中取得竞争性结果；在3D无人机状态估计中显著提高轨迹精度。

Conclusion: ReLNs为在李代数和矩阵值数据上学习广泛线性群对称性提供了实用且通用的框架。

Abstract: Encoding symmetries is a powerful inductive bias for improving the
generalization of deep neural networks. However, most existing equivariant
models are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the
broader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many
scientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural
network architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries.
ReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs,
including general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant
bilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features
and matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This
architecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only
apply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility
across a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic
benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a
Lorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with
geometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,
yielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a
practical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries
on Lie algebras and matrix-valued data. Project page:

Motivation: 现有机器学习模型和优化算法的鲁棒性保证及收敛性分析通常假设softmax算子的Lipschitz常数为1，但这一假设可能不够精确，限制了理论分析的紧致性。

Method: 通过理论分析证明softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数下的Lipschitz常数统一为1/2，并针对p=1、p=∞以及p∈(1,∞)的情况分别进行了详细分析。

Result: 证明了softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数（p≥1）下具有统一的Lipschitz常数1/2，且该常数是紧致的。在注意力架构（ViT、GPT-2、Qwen3-8B）和强化学习随机策略上的实证研究验证了这一结果的准确性。

Conclusion: softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数下的Lipschitz常数统一为1/2，这一更精确的常数能够直接改进现有关于鲁棒性和收敛性的理论结果，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: The softmax function is a basic operator in machine learning and
optimization, used in classification, attention mechanisms, reinforcement
learning, game theory, and problems involving log-sum-exp terms. Existing
robustness guarantees of learning models and convergence analysis of
optimization algorithms typically consider the softmax operator to have a
Lipschitz constant of $1$ with respect to the $\ell_2$ norm. In this work, we
prove that the softmax function is contractive with the Lipschitz constant
$1/2$, uniformly across all $\ell_p$ norms with $p \ge 1$. We also show that
the local Lipschitz constant of softmax attains $1/2$ for $p = 1$ and $p =
\infty$, and for $p \in (1,\infty)$, the constant remains strictly below $1/2$
and the supremum $1/2$ is achieved only in the limit. To our knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive norm-uniform analysis of softmax Lipschitz continuity.
We demonstrate how the sharper constant directly improves a range of existing
theoretical results on robustness and convergence. We further validate the
sharpness of the $1/2$ Lipschitz constant of the softmax operator through
empirical studies on attention-based architectures (ViT, GPT-2, Qwen3-8B) and
on stochastic policies in reinforcement learning.

*Han Wu,Jie Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoEMeta是一个用于少样本知识图谱关系学习的元学习框架，通过混合专家模型学习全局共享关系原型，并结合任务定制适应机制来平衡全局泛化和局部适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在孤立学习关系元知识时无法捕捉跨任务共享的关系模式，且难以有效整合对快速适应至关重要的局部任务特定上下文。

Method: 提出MoEMeta框架，包含：(1)混合专家模型学习全局共享关系原型以增强泛化；(2)任务定制适应机制捕捉局部上下文进行快速任务特定适应。

Result: 在三个KG基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MoEMeta始终优于现有基线方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过平衡全局泛化与局部适应能力，MoEMeta显著推进了少样本关系学习的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph relational learning seeks to perform reasoning over
relations given only a limited number of training examples. While existing
approaches largely adopt a meta-learning framework for enabling fast adaptation
to new relations, they suffer from two key pitfalls. First, they learn relation
meta-knowledge in isolation, failing to capture common relational patterns
shared across tasks. Second, they struggle to effectively incorporate local,
task-specific contexts crucial for rapid adaptation. To address these
limitations, we propose MoEMeta, a novel meta-learning framework that
disentangles globally shared knowledge from task-specific contexts to enable
both effective generalization and rapid adaptation. MoEMeta introduces two key
innovations: (i) a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that learns globally shared
relational prototypes to enhance generalization, and (ii) a task-tailored
adaptation mechanism that captures local contexts for fast task-specific
adaptation. By balancing global generalization with local adaptability, MoEMeta
significantly advances few-shot relational learning. Extensive experiments and
analyses on three KG benchmarks demonstrate that MoEMeta consistently
outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sentinel是一个个性化联邦入侵检测系统框架，通过双模型架构（个性化教师模型和轻量级共享学生模型）解决IoT网络中联邦学习面临的类别不平衡、非IID数据和高通信开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法在IoT网络入侵检测中面临严重类别不平衡、非IID数据分布和高通信开销的挑战，导致性能下降，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 采用双模型架构：个性化教师模型用于深度本地适应，轻量级学生模型用于全局共识；结合双向知识蒸馏、多层面特征对齐和类别平衡损失函数；服务器使用标准化梯度聚合。

Result: 在IoTID20和5GNIDD基准数据集上的实验表明，Sentinel在极端数据异构条件下显著优于现有联邦学习方法，同时保持通信效率。

Conclusion: Sentinel框架通过个性化联邦学习有效解决了IoT入侵检测中的关键挑战，建立了新的性能基准，特别适用于数据异构环境。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for machine
learning, but its application in intrusion detection systems (IDS) within IoT
networks is challenged by severe class imbalance, non-IID data, and high
communication overhead.These challenges severely degrade the performance of
conventional FL methods in real-world network traffic classification. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS
(pFed-IDS) framework that incorporates a dual-model architecture on each
client, consisting of a personalized teacher and a lightweight shared student
model. This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient
global model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the
compact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates
three key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge
distillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature
alignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs
normalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness
and mitigate client drift. Extensive experiments on the IoTID20 and 5GNIDD
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sentinel significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art federated methods, establishing a new performance benchmark,
especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在互补的局限性：LLM擅长处理离散原子类型但难以处理连续特征，而扩散模型擅长连续变量但难以生成准确的原子组成。需要结合两者优势。

Method: 首先使用微调的LLM生成原子类型、原子坐标和晶格结构的中间表示，然后保留预测的原子类型，将原子坐标和晶格结构传递给预训练的等变扩散模型进行细化。

Result: 在多个基准任务和数据集上优于最先进的生成模型，在结构和组成有效性方面实现平衡性能，生成更稳定和新型的材料，并具有强大的条件生成能力。

Conclusion: CrysLLMGen成功结合了LLM和扩散模型的互补优势，为晶体材料生成提供了有效的混合框架，能够满足用户定义的约束条件。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in
designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely
on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each
with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but
often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice
parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous
variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic
compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework
that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary
strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first
employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom
types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted
atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a
pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks
and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance
in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more
stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models
Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities,
effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints. Code is

TL;DR: 本文揭示了两种看似不同的Pass@K目标策略梯度优化方法（直接REINFORCE风格方法和优势整形技术）实际上是同一枚硬币的两面，通过逆向工程和正向推导建立了它们之间的等价关系。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调和两种看似不同的策略梯度优化方法，揭示它们的内在联系，为RLVR策略梯度优化提供更统一的视角。

Method: 通过逆向工程分析现有优势整形算法，揭示其隐式优化的代理奖励；同时从代理奖励目标出发，推导出新的优势整形方法。

Result: 证明了直接REINFORCE风格方法和优势整形技术本质上是等价的，现有GRPO的"困难样本加权"修改实际上是奖励层面的正则化。

Conclusion: 这种统一视角为RLVR策略梯度优化提供了新的理解框架，超越了原始的Pass@K动机，具有更广泛的适用性。

Abstract: This note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient
optimization for the Pass@K objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards: (1) direct REINFORCE-style methods, and (2) advantage-shaping
techniques that directly modify GRPO. We show that these are two sides of the
same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we
reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically
interpret practical ``hard-example up-weighting'' modifications to GRPO as
reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward
objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new
advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy
gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.

Conclusion: SwiftTS框架能够高效准确地选择时间序列预训练模型，解决了模型选择耗时的问题。

Abstract: Pre-trained models exhibit strong generalization to various downstream tasks.
However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the
most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series
pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all
candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical
dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model
performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder
architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich
characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and
model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization
across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert
composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the
transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task
sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments
on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model
selection.

Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing
(MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning,
task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service
(QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from
limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among
UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with
stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated
graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer
dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal
dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships
and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop
a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous
trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a
reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with
gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust
knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%
IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%.
Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers,
IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical
applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.

Motivation: 解决在离散状态空间中从未归一化密度采样的挑战，避免传统方法需要目标分布样本或配分函数计算的限制。

Method: 基于前向均匀扩散核的连续时间马尔可夫链，利用目标具体分数恒等式将具体分数表示为Boltzmann因子期望的比值，通过神经网络近似具体分数，提出自归一化和无偏两种TCSIS算法。

Result: 在统计物理学问题上验证了TCSIS方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TCSIS提供了一种无需目标分布样本或配分函数计算的有效采样方法，适用于离散状态空间中的未归一化密度采样问题。

Abstract: We introduce the Target Concrete Score Identity Sampler (TCSIS), a method for
sampling from unnormalized densities on discrete state spaces by learning the
reverse dynamics of a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC). Our approach builds
on a forward in time CTMC with a uniform noising kernel and relies on the
proposed Target Concrete Score Identity, which relates the concrete score, the
ratio of marginal probabilities of two states, to a ratio of expectations of
Boltzmann factors under the forward uniform diffusion kernel. This formulation
enables Monte Carlo estimation of the concrete score without requiring samples
from the target distribution or computation of the partition function. We
approximate the concrete score with a neural network and propose two
algorithms: Self-Normalized TCSIS and Unbiased TCSIS. Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of TCSIS on problems from statistical physics.

TL;DR: 神经网络算子仅使用低精度求解器数据训练时，能够超越训练数据的精度限制，在评估时达到比训练求解器更高的精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即神经网络算子受限于训练数据的精度，探索神经网络能够超越训练数据精度的可能性

Method: 理论分析神经网络归纳偏置、训练目标和数值误差特性的相互作用，并通过不同PDE实验验证

Result: 发现神经网络算子能够在多步推演中实现"仿真器优势"，学习到比训练数据更正则化的动力学特性

Conclusion: 需要重新评估仿真器基准测试，神经网络仿真器在特定操作机制下可能达到比训练源更高的物理保真度

Abstract: Neural operators or emulators for PDEs trained on data from numerical solvers
are conventionally assumed to be limited by their training data's fidelity. We
challenge this assumption by identifying "emulator superiority," where neural
networks trained purely on low-fidelity solver data can achieve higher accuracy
than those solvers when evaluated against a higher-fidelity reference. Our
theoretical analysis reveals how the interplay between emulator inductive
biases, training objectives, and numerical error characteristics enables
superior performance during multi-step rollouts. We empirically validate this
finding across different PDEs using standard neural architectures,
demonstrating that emulators can implicitly learn dynamics that are more
regularized or exhibit more favorable error accumulation properties than their
training data, potentially surpassing training data limitations and mitigating
numerical artifacts. This work prompts a re-evaluation of emulator
benchmarking, suggesting neural emulators might achieve greater physical
fidelity than their training source within specific operational regimes.

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their
ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly
useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to
explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti
bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure
modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates
physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In
addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics
Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function
approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided
as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision
methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and
our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based
interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can
offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may
help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

Abstract: Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas.
Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human
error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform
outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers
and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier
detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal
outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier
detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of
domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed
to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify
outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an
advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are
founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been
evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from
two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying
balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a
neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate
the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in
terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal
is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false
positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.

Motivation: 传统架构将感知和决策分离，导致策略失败无法直接帮助感知模块学习重要特征，需要更高效的集成方法

Method: 实现PDiT架构，在单一Transformer中交替感知和决策层，集成CLIP启发的对比损失来对齐文本任务嵌入和视觉场景特征

Result: 在BabyAI GoToLocal环境中获得更稳定的奖励和更强的对齐效果，优于标准PPO基线

Conclusion: 交错Transformer编码器是开发更集成自主代理的有前景方向

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require
understanding both vision and language. Conventional architectures typically
isolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from
decision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since
the policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is
important. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving
Transformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that
alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer.
This interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual
features dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by
CLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We
evaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that
the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a
standard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer
encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous
agents.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在低功耗FPGA上实现高效实时手势识别的可行性，适合长期边缘计算部署。

Abstract: The growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in
non-intrusive sensing methods like vibration-based gesture recognition. While
prior studies demonstrated feasibility, they often rely on complex
preprocessing and large Neural Networks (NNs) requiring costly high-performance
hardware, resulting in high energy usage and limited real-world deployability.
This study proposes an energy-efficient solution deploying compact NNs on
low-power Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enable real-time gesture
recognition with competitive accuracy. We adopt a series of optimizations: (1)
We replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input, eliminating
complex on-board preprocessing while reducing input size by 21x without
sacrificing accuracy. (2) We design two lightweight architectures (1D-CNN and
1D-SepCNN) tailored for embedded FPGAs, reducing parameters from 369 million to
as few as 216 while maintaining comparable accuracy. (3) With integer-only
quantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment.
A ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability
under tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework
to support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering
accuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two
swipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach
achieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25
FPGA. Under the PS data splitting setting, the selected 6-bit 1D-CNN reaches
0.970 average accuracy across users with 9.22 ms latency. The chosen 8-bit
1D-SepCNN further reduces latency to 6.83 ms (over 53x CPU speedup) with
slightly lower accuracy (0.949). Both consume under 1.2 mJ per inference,
demonstrating suitability for long-term edge operation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive promise in code
generation, yet their progress remains limited by the shortage of large-scale
datasets that are both diverse and well-aligned with human reasoning. Most
existing resources pair problems with solutions, but omit the intermediate
thought process that guides coding. To close this gap, we present a scalable
synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly 800k
instruction-reasoning-code-test quadruplets. Each sample combines a task, a
step-by-step reasoning trace, a working solution, and executable tests,
enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving.
Our pipeline combines four key components: curated contest problems, web-mined
content filtered by relevance classifiers, data expansion guided by reasoning
patterns, and multi-stage execution-based validation. A genetic mutation
algorithm further increases task diversity while maintaining consistency
between reasoning traces and code implementations. Our key finding is that

*Hong Wang,Jie Wang,Jian Luo,huanshuo dong,Yeqiu Chen,Runmin Jiang,Zhen huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCSF的新方法，通过利用算子之间的相似性来显著加速特征值数据生成，相比传统数值求解器实现了最高3.5倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络特征值方法需要大量带标签数据（算子和特征值）进行训练，数据生成成本高昂。现有方法忽略了算子之间的相似性这一重要因素。

Method: SCSF使用截断快速傅里叶变换排序将具有相似特征值分布的算子分组，并构建切比雪夫子空间滤波器，利用先前已解决问题的特征对来辅助解决后续问题，减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验结果显示，SCSF相比各种数值求解器实现了最高3.5倍的加速。

Conclusion: SCSF是首个加速特征值数据生成的方法，通过利用算子相似性显著提高了数据生成效率。

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific
disciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural
eigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of
inference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to
traditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large
amounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.
To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev
Subspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data
generation by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked
by existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier
transform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and
constructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from
previously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing
redundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method
to accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF
achieves up to a $3.5\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.

*Anton Savostianov,Michael T. Schaub,Benjamin Stamm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Grassmann流形上黎曼插值的低通图滤波器插值算法，用于参数化图族，避免了重复求解特征值问题的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非欧几里得域上进行图信号处理时，计算参数化图族的低通图滤波器成本过高，因为需要重复求解特征值问题来获取低频子空间。

Method: 基于Grassmann流形上的黎曼插值算法，在法坐标中进行子空间插值，并推导了子空间插值的误差界估计。

Result: 提出了两种应用：1）通过相似性校正将节点特征的时间演化转换为图拓扑演化；2）通过给定静态图诱导的点积图族，利用滤波器插值改进节点分类的消息传递方案。

Conclusion: 该算法为参数化图族提供了一种高效的低通图滤波器计算方法，在动态图拓扑和节点分类任务中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and
other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for
parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the
corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an
eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter
interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the
Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace
interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric
graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node
features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity
correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a
dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer
improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the
filter interpolation.

*Félix Chavelli,Paul Boniol,Michaël Thomazo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的时间序列分割评估指标WARI和SMS，解决了现有评估方法在捕捉分割质量、错误性质和可解释性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割评估方法主要关注变化点准确性或使用基于点的度量（如ARI），无法充分评估分割质量、忽略错误性质且可解释性有限。

Method: 开发了WARI（加权调整兰德指数）考虑分割错误位置，以及SMS（状态匹配分数）能够识别和评分四种基本分割错误类型并支持错误特定加权。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中验证了WARI和SMS，证明它们能更准确评估分割质量，并提供传统方法无法获得的错误来源和类型洞察。

Conclusion: WARI和SMS为时间序列分割提供了更全面和可解释的评估框架，能够揭示分割错误的本质特征。

Abstract: Time series segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing temporal data
across various domains, from human activity recognition to energy monitoring.
While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this
problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited.
Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on
point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture
the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer
limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by
introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index),
that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching
Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental
types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We
empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks,
showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation
quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are
inaccessible with traditional measures.

TL;DR: PAHQ通过注意力头量化加速自动电路发现，在保持分析忠实度的同时显著降低计算时间和内存消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ACDC方法在大语言模型中存在计算效率低和内存需求高的问题，而现有的加速方法主要依赖线性近似，这会显著损害分析忠实度

Method: PAHQ采用逐注意力头量化方法，将激活修补与混合精度量化对齐，仅对研究组件保持高精度，而在网络其他部分安全降低精度

Result: PAHQ加速的ACDC相比未加速版本，运行时间减少高达80%，内存消耗降低高达30%，同时保持忠实度

Conclusion: PAHQ提供了一种无需训练的实际方法，为加速机制可解释性方法开辟了新途径

Abstract: Circuit discovery, which involves identifying sparse and task-relevant
subnetworks in pre-trained language models, is a cornerstone of mechanistic
interpretability. Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal
methodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models
is severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory
requirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they
primarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly
compromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating
automated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a
fundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each
individual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between
activation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability
analysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.
Therefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated
components while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.
PAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\% and memory consumption by
up to 30\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.
Importantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit
discovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This
training-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating
mechanistic interpretability methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DAMPE是一个多模态蛋白质嵌入框架，通过最优传输对齐和条件图生成融合，解决蛋白质功能预测中的跨模态分布不匹配和噪声图数据问题，在GO基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质功能预测需要整合异质内在信号（序列、结构）和噪声外在上下文（蛋白质相互作用、GO注释），但存在跨模态嵌入分布不匹配和噪声关系图降低GNN聚合效果两大挑战。

Method: 提出DAMPE框架：1）基于最优传输的表示对齐，建立不同模态内在嵌入空间的对应关系；2）基于条件图生成的信息融合方法，通过条件编码器融合对齐后的嵌入来重构图。

Result: 在标准GO基准测试中，DAMPE优于或匹配DPFunc等SOTA方法，AUPR提升0.002-0.013 pp，Fmax提升0.004-0.007 pp。消融研究表明OT对齐贡献0.043-0.064 pp AUPR，CGG融合贡献0.005-0.111 pp Fmax。

Conclusion: DAMPE提供了一个可扩展且理论基础的鲁棒多模态蛋白质表示学习方法，显著提升了蛋白质功能预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous
intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts
(e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key
challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch
among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy
relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information
aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding
(DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms.
First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that
establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different
modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we
develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method,
where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide
informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis
implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb
graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically,
DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on
standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains
0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment
contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp
Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for
robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing
protein function prediction.

*Daiyuan Li,Shreya Arya,Robert Ghrist*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Torsor CNNs框架，用于处理具有局部对称性的图数据，通过边势能编码相邻坐标系间的群值变换，解决了传统等变神经网络依赖全局对称性的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统等变神经网络仅依赖单一全局对称性，无法有效处理具有局部对称性的领域，如图数据中相邻坐标系间的变换关系。

Method: 引入边势能作为相邻坐标系间的群值变换，构建Torsor卷积层确保局部坐标系变换的等变性，并提出frustration损失作为几何正则化器。

Result: 该框架统一并推广了多种架构（包括经典CNN和流形上的Gauge CNN），可在任意图上操作，无需全局坐标系或光滑流形结构。

Conclusion: Torsor CNNs为处理局部对称性提供了一种数学严谨的框架，在多视角3D识别等应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Most equivariant neural networks rely on a single global symmetry, limiting
their use in domains where symmetries are instead local. We introduce Torsor
CNNs, a framework for learning on graphs with local symmetries encoded as edge
potentials -- group-valued transformations between neighboring coordinate
frames. We establish that this geometric construction is fundamentally
equivalent to the classical group synchronization problem, yielding: (1) a
Torsor Convolutional Layer that is provably equivariant to local changes in
coordinate frames, and (2) the frustration loss -- a standalone geometric
regularizer that encourages locally equivariant representations when added to
any NN's training objective. The Torsor CNN framework unifies and generalizes
several architectures -- including classical CNNs and Gauge CNNs on manifolds
-- by operating on arbitrary graphs without requiring a global coordinate
system or smooth manifold structure. We establish the mathematical foundations
of this framework and demonstrate its applicability to multi-view 3D
recognition, where relative camera poses naturally define the required edge
potentials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的符号回归方法通常只使用单个观测轨迹，未能充分利用同一系统的多个重复观测。MIO旨在通过多实例学习框架，从多个轨迹中学习更鲁棒和通用的动态系统表示。

Method: 结合多实例学习和基于Transformer的符号回归，研究不同的实例聚合策略（如简单均值聚合），在1到4维系统上评估模型性能。

Result: MIO在从1维到4维的不同系统以及不同噪声水平下都持续优于现有基线方法，即使简单的均值聚合也能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 多实例学习框架能够有效提升符号回归的性能，通过利用多个观测轨迹学习更通用的动态系统表示，MIO为符号ODE推断提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce MIO, a transformer-based model for inferring symbolic ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) from multiple observed trajectories of a
dynamical system. By combining multiple instance learning with
transformer-based symbolic regression, the model effectively leverages repeated
observations of the same system to learn more generalizable representations of
the underlying dynamics. We investigate different instance aggregation
strategies and show that even simple mean aggregation can substantially boost
performance. MIO is evaluated on systems ranging from one to four dimensions
and under varying noise levels, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播算法能耗高且不太可能被大脑实现，预测编码作为大脑启发的替代算法可能更高效，但其优势尚未被一致观察到，且深层PC网络难以训练。

Method: 采用基于优化理论的理论方法：1) 将PC学习动态理解为近似信任域方法；2) 证明PC可利用高阶信息；3) 基于推理动态研究提出μPC参数化方法。

Result: 首次实现了100+层PC网络的稳定训练，在简单任务上具有竞争力性能，显著推进了对PC网络推理和学习动态的基本理解。

Conclusion: 该论文显著推进了对PC网络的基本理解，但未来研究需要关注硬件协同设计，以使PC能在规模上与BP竞争。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural
networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language
models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the
brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient
brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks
(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before
learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative
inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster
training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the
inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep
PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards
scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.
First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an
approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite
explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this
approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily
higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective
landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing
gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a
study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation
called ``$\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+
layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.
Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of
the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for
future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at
scale.

Abstract: This paper introduces GRAD, a real-time anomaly detection method for
autonomous vehicle sensors that integrates statistical analysis and deep
learning to ensure the reliability of sensor data. The proposed approach
combines the Reinforced Exponential Moving Average (REMA), which adapts
smoothing factors and thresholding for outlier detection, with the Multi-Stage
Sliding Window (MS-SW) technique for capturing both short- and long-term
patterns. These features are processed using a lightweight Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) model, which detects and classifies anomalies based on bias types, while
a recovery module restores damaged sensor data to ensure continuous system
operation. GRAD has a lightweight architecture consisting of two layers of GRU
with a limited number of neurons that make it appropriate for real-time
applications while maintaining high detection accuracy. The GRAD framework
achieved remarkable performance in anomaly detection and classification. The
model demonstrated an overall F1-score of 97.6% for abnormal data and 99.4% for
normal data, signifying its high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and
anomalous sensor data. Regarding the anomaly classification, GRAD successfully
categorized different anomaly types with high precision, enabling the recovery
module to accurately restore damaged sensor data. Relative to analogous
studies, GRAD surpasses current models by attaining a balance between elevated
detection accuracy and diminished computational expense. These results
demonstrate GRAD's potential as a reliable and efficient solution for real-time
anomaly detection in autonomous vehicle systems, guaranteeing safe vehicle
operation with minimal computational overhead.

Method: 约束LoRA因子为块对角结构，设计了一种新的LoRA适配器分片策略，使其与基础模型的张量并行执行良好对齐且无需额外通信。

Result: 在8个A100 GPU上，Llama-3.1-70B实现了最高1.79倍端到端加速，参数效率为0.87倍；Llama-3.1-8B实现了最高1.63倍端到端加速，参数效率为0.86倍。

Conclusion: 块对角LoRA在保持与标准LoRA相似参数效率的同时，显著提升了多设备部署的推理性能，是S-LoRA的有效替代方案。

Abstract: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters
simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's
weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using
different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to
be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the
LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base
model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA
sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in
theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain
certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way
of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication
for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our
block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA
(i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream
performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA.
For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x)
end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for
Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x)
the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.

Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) with Thinking-in-Modality (TiM) reasoning,
enabling flood prediction from basic Earth observation data such as Sentinel-1

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful accelerator of

requiring additional data collection and retraining for each new property. Here
we introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a

spanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning
these properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property
correlations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false
negatives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizability,
GATE -- without any problem-specific reconfiguration -- was directly applied to
the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent
real-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). Screening
billions of candidates, GATE identified 92,861 molecules as promising for
practical deployment. Four were experimentally or literarily validated, showing
strong agreement with wet-lab measurements and performance comparable to or

Abstract: We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic
models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data
generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural
Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of
feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each
specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a
neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic
specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the
complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG
is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible
instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that
satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics
for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and
\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,
and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In
this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We
implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug
design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor
molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are
well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood
targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading
clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as
preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for
synthesis and wet-lab testing.

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to
mathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in
the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models. Despite
its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning
fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in
decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance
during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on
optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive
an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric.
Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common
element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.
Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in
off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Eigen-Value (EV)框架，一种用于OOD鲁棒性的即插即用数据估值方法，仅使用ID数据子集，通过谱近似估计域差异，无需额外训练循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据估值方法主要基于ID场景，在OOD场景下泛化能力差；现有OOD感知方法计算成本高，难以实际部署。

Method: 使用ID数据协方差矩阵的特征值比率来谱近似域差异，通过扰动理论估计每个数据点对该差异的边际贡献，然后将其作为附加项集成到基于ID损失的方法中。

Result: EV在真实数据集上实现了改进的OOD鲁棒性和稳定的价值排序，同时保持计算轻量级。

Conclusion: EV为具有域偏移的大规模场景提供了一种高效的OOD鲁棒数据估值路径，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives
efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by
assigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation
methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating
changes in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as
opposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different
patterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods
based on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when
the validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware
methods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),
a plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an
ID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral
approximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and
OOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then
estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via
perturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV
plugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional
training loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and
stable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining
computationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for
large-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to
OOD-robust data valuation.

Conclusion: 要在广泛问题上实现最优性能，必须结合通用描述符与任务特定学习特征，并使用多样化的ML模型进行预测。

Abstract: We explore a "best-of-both" approach to modelling molecular properties by
combining learned molecular descriptors from a graph neural network (GNN) with
general-purpose descriptors and a mixed ensemble of machine learning (ML)
models. We introduce a MetaModel framework to aggregate predictions from a
diverse set of leading ML models. We present a featurisation scheme for
combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular
descriptors.
  We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model
on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We
further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the
ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have
underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide
set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with
task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the
predictions.

TL;DR: 提出薛定谔神经网络(SNN)，一种基于量子力学原理的条件密度估计和不确定性量化架构，通过波函数表示概率分布，具有正定性、精确归一化和多模态建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数化似然头在条件密度估计中存在归一化困难、多模态建模复杂等问题，需要一种更原则性的概率表示方法。

Method: 使用谱展开（如切比雪夫多项式）学习复系数波函数，通过玻恩规则计算概率密度，采用最大似然训练和物理启发的二次正则化器。

Conclusion: SNN提供了一个连贯且可处理的框架，将概率预测从点估计提升到基于振幅的物理启发分布表示。

Abstract: We introduce the Schrodinger Neural Network (SNN), a principled architecture
for conditional density estimation and uncertainty quantification inspired by
quantum mechanics. The SNN maps each input to a normalized wave function on the
output domain and computes predictive probabilities via the Born rule. The SNN
departs from standard parametric likelihood heads by learning complex
coefficients of a spectral expansion (e . g ., Chebyshev polynomials) whose
squared modulus yields the conditional density $p(y|x)=\left| \psi _x(y)\right|
{}^2$ with analytic normalization. This representation confers three practical
advantages: positivity and exact normalization by construction, native
multimodality through interference among basis modes without explicit mixture
bookkeeping, and yields closed-form (or efficiently computable)
functionals$-$such as moments and several calibration diagnostics$-$as
quadratic forms in coefficient space. We develop the statistical and
computational foundations of the SNN, including (i) training by exact
maximum-likelihood with unit-sphere coefficient parameterization, (ii)
physics-inspired quadratic regularizers (kinetic and potential energies)
motivated by uncertainty relations between localization and spectral
complexity, (iii) scalable low-rank and separable extensions for multivariate
outputs, (iv) operator-based extensions that represent observables,
constraints, and weak labels as self-adjoint matrices acting on the amplitude
space, and (v) a comprehensive framework for evaluating multimodal predictions.
The SNN provides a coherent, tractable framework to elevate probabilistic
prediction from point estimates to physically inspired amplitude-based
distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SGFusion算法，利用移动用户的地理信息进行联邦学习，通过将数据映射到地理区域并为每个区域训练专用模型，使用层次随机图建模区域间相关性，实现概率性的梯度融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习未充分利用移动用户的地理信息，而不同地理区域的数据分布和用户行为存在差异，需要一种能适应地理特性并促进区域间知识共享的方法。

Method: 将移动设备数据映射到地理区域，为每个区域训练FL模型；使用层次随机图建模区域间数据相关性；通过MCMC采样选择区域进行梯度融合；采用自注意力权重的随机梯度融合过程。

Result: 在6个国家的心率预测数据集上验证，SGFusion模型收敛且有上界期望误差，相比现有方法在所有国家都显著提升了模型效用，且未显著影响系统可扩展性。

Conclusion: SGFusion通过地理信息驱动的概率梯度融合，有效提升了联邦学习模型的效用，实现了地理区域间的知识共享，且计算成本可控。

Abstract: This paper proposes Stochastic Geographic Gradient Fusion (SGFusion), a novel
training algorithm to leverage the geographic information of mobile users in
Federated Learning (FL). SGFusion maps the data collected by mobile devices
onto geographical zones and trains one FL model per zone, which adapts well to
the data and behaviors of users in that zone. SGFusion models the local
data-based correlation among geographical zones as a hierarchical random graph
(HRG) optimized by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. At each training step,
every zone fuses its local gradient with gradients derived from a small set of
other zones sampled from the HRG. This approach enables knowledge fusion and
sharing among geographical zones in a probabilistic and stochastic gradient
fusion process with self-attention weights, such that "more similar" zones have
"higher probabilities" of sharing gradients with "larger attention weights."
SGFusion remarkably improves model utility without introducing undue
computational cost. Extensive theoretical and empirical results using a
heart-rate prediction dataset collected across 6 countries show that models
trained with SGFusion converge with upper-bounded expected errors and
significantly improve utility in all countries compared to existing approaches
without notable cost in system scalability.

Motivation: 现有的图提示方法主要关注提升下游任务的模型效用，但忽视了公平性问题。预训练的GNN模型会在人口统计子组间产生歧视性节点表示，因为下游图数据在节点属性和图结构中存在固有偏差。

Method: 设计了自适应特征校正模块学习定制化属性提示来抑制敏感信息，以及自适应消息校准模块生成结构提示来调整邻居节点信息流。两个提示模块联合优化以在适应预训练GNN的同时增强公平性。

Result: 在四个数据集和四种预训练策略上的实验表明，ADPrompt在节点分类任务上优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: ADPrompt框架有效解决了图提示中的公平性问题，通过双提示机制在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了公平性。

Abstract: In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through
self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely
adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for
pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between
pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts
pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable
prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph
prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,
they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In
fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations
across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains
biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we
propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness
for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute
bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized
attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,
reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message
Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust
the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of
the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting
modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct
extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to
evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed
ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了BBOPlace-Bench，这是首个专门用于评估和开发芯片布局任务的BBO算法的基准测试，集成了三种问题表述和多种BBO算法，实验表明掩码引导优化和超参数优化问题表述表现更优，进化算法在芯片布局任务中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 芯片布局在现代芯片设计中至关重要，虽然黑盒优化在芯片布局中已有数十年历史，但缺乏统一的BBO专用基准来全面评估不同问题表述和算法。

Method: 开发了BBOPlace-Bench基准测试，集成了三种BBO芯片布局问题表述（序列对、掩码引导优化、超参数优化），提供了模块化、解耦且灵活的框架，支持多种BBO算法包括模拟退火、进化算法和贝叶斯优化。

Conclusion: BBOPlace-Bench不仅促进了芯片布局的高效BBO驱动解决方案的开发，还为BBO社区拓宽了实际应用场景。

Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial
impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip.
The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of
several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem
formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the
effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential
to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field
lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various
problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose
BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and
developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem
formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and
flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and
compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of
existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary
algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show
that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter
optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem
formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,
especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench
not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip
placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are
urgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available
at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/BBOPlace-Bench.

Motivation: 自监督学习需要避免维度坍塌（特征仅占据低维子空间）和增强表示分布的均匀性，这是有效表示的两个关键属性。

Method: 引入T-REGS框架，基于学习表示的最小生成树长度进行正则化，理论分析表明该方法在任意紧致黎曼流形上都能同时缓解维度坍塌和促进分布均匀性。

Conclusion: T-REGS是一个简单有效的正则化框架，能够同时解决自监督学习中的维度坍塌和分布不均匀问题。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to
input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have
highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding
dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional
subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this
work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on
the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation.
We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously
mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on
arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data
and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at
enhancing representation quality.

Result: 实验证实该方法能缩短思维链同时保持准确性

Conclusion: 通过惩罚推理token的强化学习方法可以有效减少推理长度而不损失精度

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often consume excessive tokens, inflating
computational cost and latency. We challenge the assumption that longer
responses improve accuracy. By penalizing reasoning tokens using a discounted
reinforcement learning setup (interpretable as a small token cost) and
analyzing Blackwell optimality in restricted policy classes, we encourage
concise yet accurate reasoning. Experiments confirm our theoretical results
that this approach shortens chains of thought while preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: 该混合精度训练框架为神经ODE提供了可靠且高效的训练方案，解决了计算成本和内存需求的关键挑战

Abstract: Exploiting low-precision computations has become a standard strategy in deep
learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger
models and datasets. However, naively performing all computations in low
precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed
precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use
low-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their
success, these principles are currently not reliable for training
continuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for
neural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation
scheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.
Our scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,
parameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while
stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating
the solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two
key challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated
network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of
time steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,
open-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading
packages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the
reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on
neural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,
achieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while
maintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training.

TL;DR: 提出了针对深度Chebyshev物理信息KANs的初始化方案和RGA KANs架构，解决了训练不稳定问题，在多个PDE基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度Chebyshev物理信息KANs在训练时面临稳定性挑战，限制了其在多个PDE问题中的应用。

Method: 提出基础不可知的Glorot-like初始化方案，并引入受PirateNet启发的残差门控自适应KANs（RGA KANs）架构。

Result: 在7个标准前向PDE基准测试中，RGA KANs始终优于参数匹配的cPIKANs和PirateNets，通常高出几个数量级，并在其他方法发散时保持稳定。

Conclusion: RGA KANs成功解决了深度cPIKANs的训练不稳定问题，在PDE求解中表现出卓越的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been
successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the
PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the
standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer
perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled
to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to
several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like
initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial
improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of
cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce
Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in
deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical
tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully
traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the
diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward
PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components
demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and
PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in
settings where the others diverge.

Abstract: Fair graph clustering seeks partitions that respect network structure while
maintaining proportional representation across sensitive groups, with
applications spanning community detection, team formation, resource allocation,
and social network analysis. Many existing approaches enforce rigid constraints
or rely on multi-stage pipelines (e.g., spectral embedding followed by
$k$-means), limiting trade-off control, interpretability, and scalability. We
introduce \emph{DFNMF}, an end-to-end deep nonnegative tri-factorization
tailored to graphs that directly optimizes cluster assignments with a soft
statistical-parity regularizer. A single parameter $\lambda$ tunes the
fairness--utility balance, while nonnegativity yields parts-based factors and
transparent soft memberships. The optimization uses sparse-friendly alternating
updates and scales near-linearly with the number of edges. Across synthetic and
real networks, DFNMF achieves substantially higher group balance at comparable
modularity, often dominating state-of-the-art baselines on the Pareto front.

Conclusion: Seq-MADAC为依赖感知的自动化算法配置建立了新范式。

Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine
learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the
execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks.
Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved
the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various
parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex
algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,
determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which
are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC
(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent
inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a
sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order
information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from
synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization
algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art
MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC
establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated
algorithm configuration. Our code is available at

Motivation: 时序图交互中存在自然异质性，如少数节点对产生大部分交互事件、交互间隔时间变化大，这导致现有方法在预测不频繁交互节点对的链接时效果不佳。

Method: 提出TAMI框架，包含两个组件：log时间编码函数(LTE)将交互间隔转换为更平衡的分布，链接历史聚合(LHA)防止目标节点对的历史交互被遗忘。

Result: 在13个经典数据集和3个最新TGB数据集上的实验表明，TAMI在转导和归纳设置下都能持续提升底层模型的链接预测性能。

Conclusion: TAMI通过处理时序交互异质性，有效提升了时序图链接预测的性能，并能与现有最先进的时序图神经网络无缝集成。

Abstract: Temporal graph link prediction aims to predict future interactions between
nodes in a graph based on their historical interactions, which are encoded in
node embeddings. We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal
interactions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and
interaction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of
ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions
for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.
Existing methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning
process, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,
especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.
To cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which
contains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and
link history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information
through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA
prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being
forgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly
and readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment
results on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB)
datasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance
of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings. Our code

TL;DR: DPO-PRO：一种基于DPO的鲁棒微调算法，通过轻量级分布鲁棒优化解决偏好数据中的噪声问题，避免过度保守且计算开销小


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO方法对数据噪声敏感且容易过拟合，现有DRO方法存在过度保守和计算成本高的问题

Method: 提出DPO-PRO算法，通过轻量级DRO公式处理偏好分布的不确定性，仅关注偏好不确定性避免不必要保守性

Result: 实验表明DPO-PRO在标准对齐基准和真实公共卫生任务中，相比现有DPO变体能持续提升对噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调方法，等同于正则化DPO目标，惩罚模型在弱偏好信号下的过度自信

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity.
However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to
overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the
data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high
computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a
robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior
DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences,
avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational
overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO
objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We
evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public
health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves
robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.

Motivation: 随着执行算法变得越来越复杂，优化它们变得更具挑战性，需要开发更先进的优化方法来最小化市场影响和交易成本。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，在反应式基于代理的市场模拟器中评估执行策略，该模拟器能够分解滑点成市场影响和执行风险两个组成部分。

Result: RL代理的表现使用Almgren和Chriss的效率前沿进行评估，结果显示RL衍生策略始终优于基线方法，并在效率前沿附近运行。

Conclusion: 强化学习是交易员工具包中的一个强大工具，能够有效优化风险和影响。

Abstract: Execution algorithms are vital to modern trading, they enable market
participants to execute large orders while minimising market impact and
transaction costs. As these algorithms grow more sophisticated, optimising them
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we present a reinforcement
learning (RL) framework for discovering optimal execution strategies, evaluated
within a reactive agent-based market simulator. This simulator creates reactive
order flow and allows us to decompose slippage into its constituent components:
market impact and execution risk. We assess the RL agent's performance using
the efficient frontier based on work by Almgren and Chriss, measuring its
ability to balance risk and cost. Results show that the RL-derived strategies
consistently outperform baselines and operate near the efficient frontier,
demonstrating a strong ability to optimise for risk and impact. These findings
highlight the potential of reinforcement learning as a powerful tool in the
trader's toolkit.

TL;DR: 提出一个系统化交易框架，使用混合机器学习集成模型预测S&P 500 ETF的五日回撤，识别市场风险驱动因素并生成alpha。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够预测短期市场风险、识别其根本驱动因素并基于此生成alpha的系统化交易方法，以在系统性交易中实现机器学习驱动的alpha生成。

Method: 集成神经网络和基于树的投票模型，利用跨资产特征集（股票、固定收益、外汇、大宗商品和波动率市场），通过可解释的特征归因方法识别关键因素。

Result: 在2005-2025年回测期间，夏普比率为2.51，年化CAPM alpha为+0.28，市场beta为0.51，表明模型在有限方向性暴露下提供显著的系统性alpha。

Conclusion: 混合集成架构在捕捉非线性风险动态和识别可解释的潜在因果驱动因素方面非常有效，为系统性交易中的机器学习驱动alpha生成提供了稳健蓝图。

Abstract: We present a systematic trading framework that forecasts short-horizon market
risk, identifies its underlying drivers, and generates alpha using a hybrid
machine learning ensemble built to trade on the resulting signal. The framework
integrates neural networks with tree-based voting models to predict five-day
drawdowns in the S&P 500 ETF, leveraging a cross-asset feature set spanning
equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, commodities, and volatility markets.
Interpretable feature attribution methods reveal the key macroeconomic and
microstructural factors that differentiate high-risk (crash) from benign
(non-crash) weekly regimes. Empirical results show a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and
an annualized CAPM alpha of +0.28, with a market beta of 0.51, indicating that
the model delivers substantial systematic alpha with limited directional
exposure during the 2005--2025 backtest period. Overall, the findings
underscore the effectiveness of hybrid ensemble architectures in capturing
nonlinear risk dynamics and identifying interpretable, potentially causal
drivers, providing a robust blueprint for machine learning-driven alpha
generation in systematic trading.

Method: 将Chiarella代理模型与TABL多变量时间序列预测模型结合，并开发了包含订单删除流模拟的匹配引擎

Result: 生成的模拟数据能够重现真实的价格动态，但在市场微观结构层面存在不足，特别是尾部事件的重现不够准确

Conclusion: 需要引入更复杂的代理行为模型来更好地捕捉市场微观结构和尾部事件，以提高生成数据的保真度

Abstract: The recent application of deep learning models to financial trading has
heightened the need for high fidelity financial time series data. This
synthetic data can be used to supplement historical data to train large trading
models. The state-of-the-art models for the generative application often rely
on huge amounts of historical data and large, complicated models. These models
range from autoregressive and diffusion-based models through to architecturally
simpler models such as the temporal-attention bilinear layer. Agent-based
approaches to modelling limit order book dynamics can also recreate trading
activity through mechanistic models of trader behaviours. In this work, we
demonstrate how a popular agent-based framework for simulating intraday trading
activity, the Chiarella model, can be combined with one of the most performant
deep learning models for forecasting multi-variate time series, the TABL model.
This forecasting model is coupled to a simulation of a matching engine with a
novel method for simulating deleted order flow. Our simulator gives us the
ability to test the generative abilities of the forecasting model using
stylised facts. Our results show that this methodology generates realistic
price dynamics however, when analysing deeper, parts of the markets
microstructure are not accurately recreated, highlighting the necessity for
including more sophisticated agent behaviors into the modeling framework to
help account for tail events.

Abstract: This work analyzes the computational burden of pricing binary options in
rare-event settings and introduces an adaptation of the adaptive multilevel
splitting (AMS) method for financial derivatives. Standard Monte Carlo is
inefficient for deep out of the money binaries due to discontinuous payoffs and
low exercise probabilities, requiring very large samples for accurate
estimates. An AMS scheme is developed for binary options under Black-Scholes
and Heston dynamics, reformulating the rare-event problem as a sequence of
conditional events. Numerical experiments compare the method to Monte Carlo and
to other techniques such as antithetic variables and multilevel Monte Carlo
(MLMC) across four contracts: European digital calls and puts, and Asian
digital calls and puts. Results show up to a 200-fold computational gain for
deep out-of-the-money cases while preserving unbiasedness. No evidence is found
of prior applications of AMS to financial derivatives. The approach improves
pricing efficiency for rare-event contracts such as parametric insurance and
catastrophe linked securities. An open-source Rcpp implementation is provided,
supporting multiple discretizations and importance functions.

Motivation: 传统因果推断方法主要识别因果关系，但同等重要的是确定因果影响的时间范围，即因果影响何时开始、持续多久。现有方法缺乏对因果影响范围的严格数学定义和计算。

Method: 采用同化因果推理(ACI)方法，结合贝叶斯数据同化，开发了前向和后向因果影响范围的数学公式。前向CIR量化原因的时间影响，后向CIR追踪观察效应的触发起点。

Conclusion: 该前向-后向CIR框架为探测复杂动力系统提供了新可能，特别是在地球系统分岔点和噪声诱导临界点研究中具有重要应用价值，对科学、政策和决策制定有直接意义。

Abstract: Causal inference identifies cause-and-effect relationships between variables.
While traditional approaches rely on data to reveal causal links, a recently
developed method, assimilative causal inference (ACI), integrates observations
with dynamical models. It utilizes Bayesian data assimilation to trace causes
back from observed effects by quantifying the reduction in uncertainty. ACI
advances the detection of instantaneous causal relationships and the
intermittent reversal of causal roles over time. Beyond identifying causal
connections, an equally important challenge is determining the associated
causal influence range (CIR), indicating when causal influences emerged and for
how long they persist. In this paper, ACI is employed to develop mathematically
rigorous formulations of both forward and backward CIRs at each time. The
forward CIR quantifies the temporal impact of a cause, while the backward CIR
traces the onset of triggers for an observed effect, thus characterizing causal
predictability and attribution of outcomes at each transient phase,
respectively. Objective and robust metrics for both CIRs are introduced,
eliminating the need for empirical thresholds. Computationally efficient
approximation algorithms to compute CIRs are developed, which facilitate the
use of closed-form expressions for a broad class of nonlinear dynamical
systems. Numerical simulations demonstrate how this forward and backward CIR
framework provides new possibilities for probing complex dynamical systems. It
advances the study of bifurcation-driven and noise-induced tipping points in
Earth systems, investigates the impact from resolving the interfering variables
when determining the influence ranges, and elucidates atmospheric blocking
mechanisms in the equatorial region. These results have direct implications for
science, policy, and decision-making.

Conclusion: IA-BMA在异构设置下能有效组合多个候选模型，提供优于现有方法的预测性能。

Abstract: This paper studies prediction with multiple candidate models, where the goal
is to combine their outputs. This task is especially challenging in
heterogeneous settings, where different models may be better suited to
different inputs. We propose input adaptive Bayesian Model Averaging (IA-BMA),
a Bayesian method that assigns model weights conditional on the input. IA-BMA
employs an input adaptive prior, and yields a posterior distribution that
adapts to each prediction, which we estimate with amortized variational
inference. We derive formal guarantees for its performance, relative to any
single predictor selected per input. We evaluate IABMA across regression and
classification tasks, studying data from personalized cancer treatment,
credit-card fraud detection, and UCI datasets. IA-BMA consistently delivers
more accurate and better-calibrated predictions than both non-adaptive
baselines and existing adaptive methods.

Abstract: Sparse variable selection improves interpretability and generalization in
high-dimensional learning by selecting a small subset of informative features.
Recent advances in Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) have enabled solving
large-scale non-private sparse regression - known as Best Subset Selection
(BSS) - with millions of variables in minutes. However, extending these
algorithmic advances to the setting of Differential Privacy (DP) has remained
largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce two new pure differentially
private estimators for sparse variable selection, levering modern MIP
techniques. Our framework is general and applies broadly to problems like
sparse regression or classification, and we provide theoretical support
recovery guarantees in the case of BSS. Inspired by the exponential mechanism,
we develop structured sampling procedures that efficiently explore the
non-convex objective landscape, avoiding the exhaustive combinatorial search in
the exponential mechanism. We complement our theoretical findings with
extensive numerical experiments, using both least squares and hinge loss for
our objective function, and demonstrate that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art empirical support recovery, outperforming competing algorithms
in settings with up to $p=10^4$.

Motivation: 将预测不确定性分解为偶然性（不可约）和认知性（可约）分量对于机器学习系统的开发和部署至关重要。流行的认知不确定性度量是响应变量与模型参数之间的互信息，但计算后验分布具有挑战性。

Method: 引入基于bootstrap的频数学认知不确定性度量方法，通过渐近展开证明其与贝叶斯互信息的等价性。

Result: 证明了提出的频数学度量与贝叶斯互信息渐近等价，为互信息提供了频数解释，并给出了新的计算策略。

Conclusion: 该方法为认知不确定性度量提供了频数视角，并与深度集成方法建立联系，解释了其实际成功的原因。

Abstract: Decomposing prediction uncertainty into its aleatoric (irreducible) and
epistemic (reducible) components is critical for the development and deployment
of machine learning systems. A popular, principled measure for epistemic
uncertainty is the mutual information between the response variable and model
parameters. However, evaluating this measure requires access to the posterior
distribution of the model parameters, which is challenging to compute. In view
of this, we introduce a frequentist measure of epistemic uncertainty based on
the bootstrap. Our main theoretical contribution is a novel asymptotic
expansion that reveals that our proposed (frequentist) measure and the
(Bayesian) mutual information are asymptotically equivalent. This provides
frequentist interpretations to mutual information and new computational
strategies for approximating it. Moreover, we link our proposed approach to the
widely-used heuristic approach of deep ensembles, giving added perspective on
their practical success.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统嵌入方法在基数较大时参数数量（基数×嵌入维度）变得不可行，导致过拟合和计算负担。需要一种能显著减少参数数量并保持性能的方法。

Method: 将嵌入重新解释为变分自编码器框架中的潜在随机效应，使用非线性混合模型方法，参数数量由编码器架构决定而非基数大小。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的广泛实验（包括协同过滤和表格回归任务）表明，MMbeddings始终优于传统嵌入方法。

Conclusion: MMbeddings通过桥接经典统计理论和现代深度学习，在高基数设置中展现出显著优势，具有广泛的机器学习应用潜力。

Abstract: We present MMbeddings, a probabilistic embedding approach that reinterprets
categorical embeddings through the lens of nonlinear mixed models, effectively
bridging classical statistical theory with modern deep learning. By treating
embeddings as latent random effects within a variational autoencoder framework,
our method substantially decreases the number of parameters -- from the
conventional embedding approach of cardinality $\times$ embedding dimension,
which quickly becomes infeasible with large cardinalities, to a significantly
smaller, cardinality-independent number determined primarily by the encoder
architecture. This reduction dramatically mitigates overfitting and
computational burden in high-cardinality settings. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real datasets, encompassing collaborative filtering and tabular
regression tasks using varied architectures, demonstrate that MMbeddings
consistently outperforms traditional embeddings, underscoring its potential
across diverse machine learning applications.

TL;DR: MetaCaDI是一个贝叶斯元学习框架，用于联合发现因果图和未知干预，通过解析适配实现快速适应少样本干预目标预测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂真实世界系统的因果机制发现面临数据收集成本高和干预未知的挑战，需要能够快速适应新任务的解决方案。

Method: 采用元学习方法，学习跨多个实验的共享因果图结构，并使用闭式解析适配绕过昂贵的双层梯度优化。

Result: 在合成和复杂基因表达数据上的实验显示，MetaCaDI显著优于现有方法，仅需10个数据实例就能有效识别干预目标。

Conclusion: MetaCaDI在数据稀缺场景下表现出强大的鲁棒性，在因果图恢复和干预目标识别方面均表现优异。

Abstract: Uncovering the underlying causal mechanisms of complex real-world systems
remains a significant challenge, as these systems often entail high data
collection costs and involve unknown interventions. We introduce MetaCaDI, the
first framework to cast the joint discovery of a causal graph and unknown
interventions as a meta-learning problem. MetaCaDI is a Bayesian framework that
learns a shared causal graph structure across multiple experiments and is
optimized to rapidly adapt to new, few-shot intervention target prediction
tasks. A key innovation is our model's analytical adaptation, which uses a
closed-form solution to bypass expensive and potentially unstable
gradient-based bilevel optimization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
complex gene expression data demonstrate that MetaCaDI significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It excels at both causal graph recovery
and identifying intervention targets from as few as 10 data instances, proving
its robustness in data-scarce scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了学生成长百分位数(SGP)方法中的'插值悖论'：独立分位数回归与后处理单调化修正存在方法不一致性，可能违反分位数性质。作者提出神经网络多分位数回归(NNQR)作为可扩展的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SGP系统使用独立分位数回归加后处理修正的方法存在根本性方法不一致，且约束联合分位数回归(CJQR)计算复杂度高，难以处理大规模教育数据。

Method: 提出神经网络多分位数回归(NNQR)，利用共享隐藏层和组合pinball损失的凸性，通过SGD优化实现可扩展训练，隐式减少分位数交叉。

Result: 实证分析显示独立分位数回归会产生分位数交叉，而CJQR和NNQR都能强制单调性。NNQR在保持理论有效性的同时具有计算可行性。

Conclusion: NNQR是操作化SGP系统的可行、可扩展替代方案，能够将理论有效性与计算可行性相结合。

Abstract: Student Growth Percentiles (SGPs), widely adopted across U.S. state
assessment systems, employ independent quantile regression followed by post-hoc
correction using an isotonic projection method (\texttt{isotonize=TRUE} in the
\texttt{SGP} R package) to address quantile crossing. We demonstrate this
approach contains a fundamental methodological inconsistency: interpolation
between independently-estimated, potentially crossed quantiles requires
monotonicity, yet the post-hoc correction alters estimates in ways that may
violate the quantile property $P(Y \leq \hat{Q}_{\tau}(Y|X) \mid X) = \tau$. We
term this the \emph{interpolation paradox}. While theoretically sound
constrained joint quantile regression (CJQR) eliminates crossing by enforcing
non-crossing constraints during optimization, we analyze its computational
complexity (often scaling poorly, e.g., $\mathcal{O}((qn)^3)$ for standard LP
solvers) rendering it intractable for large-scale educational data ($n >
100{,}000$). We examine the SGP package's switch to the Frisch-Newton interior
point method (\texttt{rq.method.for.large.n="fn"}) for large $N$, noting that
while efficient for \emph{independent} QR, it doesn't resolve the joint
problem's complexity or the paradox. We propose neural network-based
multi-quantile regression (NNQR) with shared hidden layers as a practical
alternative. Leveraging the convexity of the composite pinball loss, SGD-based
optimization used in NN training can reliably approach the global optimum,
offering scalability ($O(n)$) and implicitly reducing crossing. Our empirical
analysis shows independent QR yields crossing, while both CJQR and NNQR enforce
monotonicity. NNQR emerges as a viable, scalable alternative for operational
SGP systems, aligning theoretical validity with computational feasibility.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Sinkhorn桥在双样本估计设置中的统计性能，建立了Sinkhorn迭代的平方总变差误差统计界限：O(1/m+1/n + r^{4k})，为Schrödinger桥估计器的有限样本性能提供了理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注单样本估计设置，其中真实源分布完全可访问。本文旨在进一步验证Sinkhorn桥方法，研究在双样本估计设置中（仅从源和目标分布获得有限样本）中间Sinkhorn迭代的统计性能。

Method: 通过建立Sinkhorn桥迭代的统计界限，分析有限样本性能。具体采用平方总变差误差作为评估指标，其中m和n分别是源和目标分布的样本大小，k是Sinkhorn迭代次数。

Result: 获得了统计界限：O(1/m+1/n + r^{4k})，其中r∈(0,1)。该结果为Schrödinger桥估计器的有限样本性能提供了理论保证，并为选择样本大小和Sinkhorn迭代次数提供了实用指导。

Conclusion: 本文的理论结果通过先前未被注意到的连接，适用于几种代表性方法如[SF]²M、DSBM-IMF、BM2和LightSB(-M)在特定设置下的情况，为Schrödinger桥估计器的实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem seeks the optimal stochastic process that
connects two given probability distributions with minimal energy modification.
While the Sinkhorn algorithm is widely used to solve the static optimal
transport problem, a recent work (Pooladian and Niles-Weed, 2024) proposed the
Sinkhorn bridge, which estimates Schr\"odinger bridges by plugging optimal
transport into the time-dependent drifts of SDEs, with statistical guarantees
in the one-sample estimation setting where the true source distribution is
fully accessible. In this work, to further justify this method, we study the
statistical performance of intermediate Sinkhorn iterations in the two-sample
estimation setting, where only finite samples from both source and target
distributions are available. Specifically, we establish a statistical bound on
the squared total variation error of Sinkhorn bridge iterations: $O(1/m+1/n +
r^{4k})~(r \in (0,1))$, where $m$ and $n$ are the sample sizes from the source
and target distributions, respectively, and $k$ is the number of Sinkhorn
iterations. This result provides a theoretical guarantee for the finite-sample
performance of the Schr\"odinger bridge estimator and offers practical guidance
for selecting sample sizes and the number of Sinkhorn iterations. Notably, our
theoretical results apply to several representative methods such as [SF]$^2$M,
DSBM-IMF, BM2, and LightSB(-M) under specific settings, through the previously
unnoticed connection between these estimators.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to train a machine learning model using
both labelled and unlabelled data. While the unlabelled data have been used in
various ways to improve the prediction accuracy, the reason why unlabelled data
could help is not fully understood. One interesting and promising direction is
to understand SSL from a causal perspective. In light of the independent causal
mechanisms principle, the unlabelled data can be helpful when the label causes
the features but not vice versa. However, the causal relations between the
features and labels can be complex in real world applications. In this paper,
we propose a SSL framework that works with general causal models in which the
variables have flexible causal relations. More specifically, we explore the
causal graph structures and design corresponding causal generative models which
can be learned with the help of unlabelled data. The learned causal generative
model can generate synthetic labelled data for training a more accurate
predictive model. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method by
empirical studies on both simulated and real data.

*Shunta Akiyama*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了块坐标下降(BCD)算法用于训练深度神经网络，在严格单调递增激活函数下首次证明了收敛到全局最小值的理论保证，并扩展到ReLU激活函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作只能证明BCD在神经网络中收敛到驻点，缺乏收敛到全局最小值的理论保证，需要建立更强的收敛理论。

Method: 使用块坐标下降算法，分析输出层和隐藏层的损失函数行为，提出带跳跃连接和非负投影的改进BCD算法来处理ReLU激活函数。

Result: 理论证明输出层损失指数下降，隐藏层损失得到良好控制，实现了任意小损失的全局收敛，并通过Rademacher复杂度框架获得泛化界。

Conclusion: BCD算法不仅具有强优化保证，还提供良好的泛化性能，实验验证了理论结果在严格单调和ReLU激活函数下的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for
training deep neural networks and provide a new global convergence guarantee
under strictly monotonically increasing activation functions. While existing
works demonstrate convergence to stationary points for BCD in neural networks,
our contribution is the first to prove convergence to global minima, ensuring
arbitrarily small loss. We show that the loss with respect to the output layer
decreases exponentially while the loss with respect to the hidden layers
remains well-controlled. Additionally, we derive generalization bounds using
the Rademacher complexity framework, demonstrating that BCD not only achieves
strong optimization guarantees but also provides favorable generalization
performance. Moreover, we propose a modified BCD algorithm with skip
connections and non-negative projection, extending our convergence guarantees
to ReLU activation, which are not strictly monotonic. Empirical experiments
confirm our theoretical findings, showing that the BCD algorithm achieves a
small loss for strictly monotonic and ReLU activations.

TL;DR: 提出OEUVRE在线学习评估器，通过递归更新在常数时间和内存下估计当前时间步的期望损失，无需手动调参且性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习算法需要准确估计当前时间步的期望损失，但现有方法需要强条件假设且超参数需要仔细调优。

Method: 使用算法稳定性，对每个新样本在当前和前一时间步学习函数上进行评估，递归更新损失估计。

Result: OEUVRE在多种在线和随机任务中表现优异，即使其他估计器使用真实值调参也能匹配或超越其性能。

Conclusion: OEUVRE提供了一种高效、自适应的在线学习损失估计方法，具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Online learning algorithms continually update their models as data arrive,
making it essential to accurately estimate the expected loss at the current
time step. The prequential method is an effective estimation approach which can
be practically deployed in various ways. However, theoretical guarantees have
previously been established under strong conditions on the algorithm, and
practical algorithms have hyperparameters which require careful tuning. We
introduce OEUVRE, an estimator that evaluates each incoming sample on the
function learned at the current and previous time steps, recursively updating
the loss estimate in constant time and memory. We use algorithmic stability, a
property satisfied by many popular online learners, for optimal updates and
prove consistency, convergence rates, and concentration bounds for our
estimator. We design a method to adaptively tune OEUVRE's hyperparameters and
test it across diverse online and stochastic tasks. We observe that OEUVRE
matches or outperforms other estimators even when their hyperparameters are
tuned with oracle access to ground truth.

TL;DR: CPFM是一个结合可控降维和高保真重建的框架，通过耦合连续流学习高维数据和低维嵌入，能够从潜空间流采样p(y|x)和从数据空间流采样p(x|y)，保留残差信息在流网络权重中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统降维方法中压缩过程中丢弃信息难以恢复的问题，提供定制化的可控性，让用户能明确决定在潜空间中保留哪些语义因素，同时通过流网络恢复补充信息。

Method: 基于两个组件：(1)扩展的Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输目标，建立数据和嵌入之间的概率对应关系；(2)双条件流匹配网络，将对应关系外推到基础空间。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CPFM产生语义丰富的嵌入，并以比现有基线更高的保真度重建数据。

Conclusion: CPFM框架成功实现了可控降维和高保真重建的统一，通过耦合流匹配方法有效解决了传统降维方法的信息丢失问题。

Abstract: We introduce Coupled Flow Matching (CPFM), a framework that integrates
controllable dimensionality reduction and high-fidelity reconstruction. CPFM
learns coupled continuous flows for both the high-dimensional data x and the
low-dimensional embedding y, which enables sampling p(y|x) via a latent-space
flow and p(x|y) via a data-space flow. Unlike classical dimension-reduction
methods, where information discarded during compression is often difficult to
recover, CPFM preserves the knowledge of residual information within the
weights of a flow network. This design provides bespoke controllability: users
may decide which semantic factors to retain explicitly in the latent space,
while the complementary information remains recoverable through the flow
network. Coupled flow matching builds on two components: (i) an extended
Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport objective that establishes a probabilistic
correspondence between data and embeddings, and (ii) a dual-conditional
flow-matching network that extrapolates the correspondence to the underlying
space. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that CPFM yields semantically
rich embeddings and reconstructs data with higher fidelity than existing
baselines.

TL;DR: 本文为物理信息统计学习(PISL)建立了理论框架，分析软惩罚与硬约束的权衡，以及物理知识相比纯数据驱动方法的统计增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PISL方法在实践中广泛应用，但缺乏关于正则化如何影响统计性能的全面理论理解，特别是软惩罚vs硬约束的权衡和物理知识的统计增益这两个基本问题。

Method: 针对凸函数类中线性方程表达的物理知识，基于小球方法开发复杂度相关的误差率分析框架。

Result: 在适当假设下，物理信息估计器的误差率与硬约束经验误差最小化器相当，仅相差常数项；信息惩罚能有效降低模型复杂度，类似降维，从而提升学习性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为评估凸函数类中物理信息估计器的统计特性建立了理论框架，有助于缩小统计理论与实际PISL之间的差距，并可能应用于文献中尚未探索的案例。

Abstract: Physics-informed statistical learning (PISL) integrates empirical data with
physical knowledge to enhance the statistical performance of estimators. While
PISL methods are widely used in practice, a comprehensive theoretical
understanding of how informed regularization affects statistical properties is
still missing. Specifically, two fundamental questions have yet to be fully
addressed: (1) what is the trade-off between considering soft penalties versus
hard constraints, and (2) what is the statistical gain of incorporating
physical knowledge compared to purely data-driven empirical error minimisation.
In this paper, we address these questions for PISL in convex classes of
functions under physical knowledge expressed as linear equations by developing
appropriate complexity dependent error rates based on the small-ball method. We
show that, under suitable assumptions, (1) the error rates of physics-informed
estimators are comparable to those of hard constrained empirical error
minimisers, differing only by constant terms, and that (2) informed
penalization can effectively reduce model complexity, akin to dimensionality
reduction, thereby improving learning performance. This work establishes a
theoretical framework for evaluating the statistical properties of
physics-informed estimators in convex classes of functions, contributing to
closing the gap between statistical theory and practical PISL, with potential
applications to cases not yet explored in the literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定预算最佳臂识别算法通常局限于特定风险度量，且需要提前知道总预算或丢弃大量样本，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于可证明极小极大最优的算法框架，提出了Almost Tracking算法，这是一个闭式解算法，不需要提前知道总预算。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该算法优于现有的随时算法和固定预算算法。

Conclusion: Almost Tracking算法在最佳臂识别问题中具有理论保证和实际优势，不需要提前知道总预算且性能优越。

Abstract: We consider the best arm identification problem, where the goal is to
identify the arm with the highest mean reward from a set of $K$ arms under a
limited sampling budget. This problem models many practical scenarios such as
A/B testing. We consider a class of algorithms for this problem, which is
provably minimax optimal up to a constant factor. This idea is a generalization
of existing works in fixed-budget best arm identification, which are limited to
a particular choice of risk measures. Based on the framework, we propose Almost
Tracking, a closed-form algorithm that has a provable guarantee on the popular
risk measure $H_1$. Unlike existing algorithms, Almost Tracking does not
require the total budget in advance nor does it need to discard a significant
part of samples, which gives a practical advantage. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our algorithm outperforms
existing anytime algorithms as well as fixed-budget algorithms.

TL;DR: 研究Transformer在上下文学习中的表现，证明预训练Transformer在不同难度任务和分布偏移下能达到最优收敛率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解预训练Transformer在不同难度任务和测试分布偏移下的性能表现，特别是在混合分布预训练后面对固定难度测试任务的适应性

Method: 使用混合分布π对Transformer进行预训练，其中包含不同难度级别的任务，然后在固定难度β的测试分布μ上评估性能，考虑χ²散度约束下的分布偏移

Result: 证明预训练Transformer在足够数据下能实现与难度级别β对应的最优收敛率，且对测试分布偏移具有鲁棒性，在简单任务上能达到更快的收敛速度

Conclusion: 预训练Transformer不仅能适应不同难度任务，还能在分布偏移下保持最优性能，其收敛率甚至优于知道测试分布的估计器，提供了比极小极大下界更合适的优化保证

Abstract: We study in-context learning problems where a Transformer is pretrained on
tasks drawn from a mixture distribution $\pi=\sum_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}
\lambda_{\alpha} \pi_{\alpha}$, called the pretraining prior, in which each
mixture component $\pi_{\alpha}$ is a distribution on tasks of a specific
difficulty level indexed by $\alpha$. Our goal is to understand the performance
of the pretrained Transformer when evaluated on a different test distribution
$\mu$, consisting of tasks of fixed difficulty $\beta\in\mathcal{A}$, and with
potential distribution shift relative to $\pi_\beta$, subject to the
chi-squared divergence $\chi^2(\mu,\pi_{\beta})$ being at most $\kappa$. In
particular, we consider nonparametric regression problems with random
smoothness, and multi-index models with random smoothness as well as random
effective dimension. We prove that a large Transformer pretrained on sufficient
data achieves the optimal rate of convergence corresponding to the difficulty
level $\beta$, uniformly over test distributions $\mu$ in the chi-squared
divergence ball. Thus, the pretrained Transformer is able to achieve faster
rates of convergence on easier tasks and is robust to distribution shift at
test time. Finally, we prove that even if an estimator had access to the test
distribution $\mu$, the convergence rate of its expected risk over $\mu$ could
not be faster than that of our pretrained Transformers, thereby providing a
more appropriate optimality guarantee than minimax lower bounds.

Motivation: 完全校准仅适用于低维预测问题，而弱校准形式缺乏决策理论性质。本文旨在解决在部分校准保证下，决策者如何鲁棒地映射预测到行动的问题。

Method: 通过对偶论证表征极小极大最优决策规则，分析不同校准保证下的最优策略，并对适用于平方误差优化的回归模型进行实证评估。

Result: 研究发现决策校准（及任何更强的校准概念）在极小极大意义上能够恢复"信任预测"的最优策略，这比完全校准更弱且更易处理。

Conclusion: 对于达不到决策校准的校准保证，极小极大最优决策规则仍然可高效计算，为高维预测问题提供了实用的决策框架。

Abstract: Calibration has emerged as a foundational goal in ``trustworthy machine
learning'', in part because of its strong decision theoretic semantics.
Independent of the underlying distribution, and independent of the decision
maker's utility function, calibration promises that amongst all policies
mapping predictions to actions, the uniformly best policy is the one that
``trusts the predictions'' and acts as if they were correct. But this is true
only of \emph{fully calibrated} forecasts, which are tractable to guarantee
only for very low dimensional prediction problems. For higher dimensional
prediction problems (e.g. when outcomes are multiclass), weaker forms of
calibration have been studied that lack these decision theoretic properties. In
this paper we study how a conservative decision maker should map predictions
endowed with these weaker (``partial'') calibration guarantees to actions, in a
way that is robust in a minimax sense: i.e. to maximize their expected utility
in the worst case over distributions consistent with the calibration
guarantees. We characterize their minimax optimal decision rule via a duality
argument, and show that surprisingly, ``trusting the predictions and acting
accordingly'' is recovered in this minimax sense by \emph{decision calibration}
(and any strictly stronger notion of calibration), a substantially weaker and
more tractable condition than full calibration. For calibration guarantees that
fall short of decision calibration, the minimax optimal decision rule is still
efficiently computable, and we provide an empirical evaluation of a natural one
that applies to any regression model solved to optimize squared error.

TL;DR: 本文通过随机投影和有损压缩技术提出了新的条件互信息(CMI)泛化误差界，证明这些界比现有方法更紧致，能够为某些问题提供O(1/√n)的泛化保证，并证明记忆化并非良好泛化的必要条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MI和CMI泛化误差界在某些问题实例中变得无效或无法正确描述泛化行为，Attias等人和Livni的工作提出了数据"记忆化"问题，即存在学习算法在某些分布下必须"记忆"大部分训练数据。

Method: 利用随机投影和有损压缩技术建立新的条件互信息(CMI)泛化误差界，并构造不记忆的辅助算法来比较泛化性能。

Result: 新提出的CMI界比现有界更紧致，能为某些问题提供O(1/√n)的泛化保证，证明对于任何学习算法都存在不记忆的辅助算法能获得可比较的泛化误差。

Conclusion: 记忆化并非良好泛化的必要条件，通过适当的技术可以避免记忆化同时保持好的泛化性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we leverage stochastic projection and lossy compression to
establish new conditional mutual information (CMI) bounds on the generalization
error of statistical learning algorithms. It is shown that these bounds are
generally tighter than the existing ones. In particular, we prove that for
certain problem instances for which existing MI and CMI bounds were recently
shown in Attias et al. [2024] and Livni [2023] to become vacuous or fail to
describe the right generalization behavior, our bounds yield suitable
generalization guarantees of the order of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$, where $n$
is the size of the training dataset. Furthermore, we use our bounds to
investigate the problem of data "memorization" raised in those works, and which
asserts that there are learning problem instances for which any learning
algorithm that has good prediction there exist distributions under which the
algorithm must "memorize" a big fraction of the training dataset. We show that
for every learning algorithm, there exists an auxiliary algorithm that does not
memorize and which yields comparable generalization error for any data
distribution. In part, this shows that memorization is not necessary for good
generalization.

Motivation: 解决问答系统中用户查询的在线分类问题，其中智能体需要在咨询昂贵的人类专家和自行猜测之间做出权衡，目标是相对于拥有免费专家访问权限的预言机最小化遗憾。

Method: 提出三种分类器：CHC（保守基于凸包的分类器）维护专家标记查询的凸包，当查询落在所有已知凸包外时调用专家；CC（基于中心的分类器）适用于子高斯混合分布；GHC（广义基于凸包的分类器）作为CHC的实用扩展，通过可调阈值参数允许更激进的猜测。

Result: 当时间范围T至少指数于嵌入维度d时，CHC实现O(log^d T)遗憾且对d=1是最小极大最优的；当T ≤ e^d时，CC实现与标签数量N成正比的遗憾；GHC在真实问答数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 本文为问答系统中的在线分类问题提供了理论保证和实用算法，在不同时间范围内都能有效平衡专家咨询成本和分类准确性。

Abstract: We introduce and study an online problem arising in question answering
systems. In this problem, an agent must sequentially classify user-submitted
queries represented by $d$-dimensional embeddings drawn i.i.d. from an unknown
distribution. The agent may consult a costly human expert for the correct
label, or guess on her own without receiving feedback. The goal is to minimize
regret against an oracle with free expert access. When the time horizon $T$ is
at least exponential in the embedding dimension $d$, one can learn the geometry
of the class regions: in this regime, we propose the Conservative Hull-based
Classifier (CHC), which maintains convex hulls of expert-labeled queries and
calls the expert as soon as a query lands outside all known hulls. CHC attains
$\mathcal{O}(\log^d T)$ regret in $T$ and is minimax optimal for $d=1$.
Otherwise, the geometry cannot be reliably learned without additional
distributional assumptions. We show that when the queries are drawn from a
subgaussian mixture, for $T \le e^d$, a Center-based Classifier (CC) achieves
regret proportional to $N\log{N}$ where $N$ is the number of labels. To bridge
these regimes, we introduce the Generalized Hull-based Classifier (GHC), a
practical extension of CHC that allows for more aggressive guessing via a
tunable threshold parameter. Our approach is validated with experiments,
notably on real-world question-answering datasets using embeddings derived from
state-of-the-art large language models.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了趋势跟踪中多时间尺度等权重分配的传统观点，通过贝叶斯优化框架动态调整各时间尺度权重，发现中期趋势对组合贡献有限，短长期趋势组合即可获得更好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统趋势跟踪策略通常等权重分配不同时间尺度的趋势信号，认为中期趋势是"最佳区间"。本文旨在验证这种假设的合理性，并探索更优的动态权重分配方法。

Method: 使用贝叶斯优化框架在资产层面优化各趋势时间尺度的权重，然后应用具有稀疏性和换手率控制的贝叶斯图模型进行动态资产配置。

Result: 研究发现中期趋势带（125天）对组合性能和分散化贡献很小，移除该层后夏普比率和回撤效率得到改善，同时保持基准相关性。短长期趋势组合形成"杠铃结构"即可捕获大部分性能。

Conclusion: 更多时间尺度并不总是改善分散化，某些时间尺度分散化可能掩盖趋势溢价中的不必要冗余。短长期趋势组合相比包含中期趋势的传统方法具有更优表现和更低模型复杂度。

Abstract: Recent work has emphasized the diversification benefits of combining trend
signals across multiple horizons, with the medium-term window-typically six
months to one year-long viewed as the "sweet spot" of trend-following. This
paper revisits this conventional view by reallocating exposure dynamically
across horizons using a Bayesian optimization framework designed to learn the
optimal weights assigned to each trend horizon at the asset level. The common
practice of equal weighting implicitly assumes that all assets benefit equally
from all horizons; we show that this assumption is both theoretically and
empirically suboptimal. We first optimize the horizon-level weights at the
asset level to maximize the informativeness of trend signals before applying
Bayesian graphical models-with sparsity and turnover control-to allocate
dynamically across assets. The key finding is that the medium-term band
contributes little incremental performance or diversification once short- and
long-term components are included. Removing the 125-day layer improves Sharpe
ratios and drawdown efficiency while maintaining benchmark correlation. We then
rationalize this outcome through a minimum-variance formulation, showing that
the medium-term horizon largely overlaps with its neighboring horizons. The
resulting "barbell" structure-combining short- and long-term trends-captures
most of the performance while reducing model complexity. This result challenges
the common belief that more horizons always improve diversification and
suggests that some forms of time-scale diversification may conceal unnecessary
redundancy in trend premia.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 私募股权虽然历史回报强劲，但其固有的非流动性和缺乏透明度引发了投资者信任和系统性稳定性的担忧，特别是在市场波动加剧时期。

Method: 使用先进的图形模型解码流动性私募股权代理指标，并整合非对称风险调整以模拟私募股权的独特表现动态。

Abstract: In response to growing demand for resilient and transparent financial
instruments, we introduce a novel framework for replicating private equity (PE)
performance using liquid, AI-enhanced strategies. Despite historically
delivering robust returns, private equity's inherent illiquidity and lack of
transparency raise significant concerns regarding investor trust and systemic
stability, particularly in periods of heightened market volatility. Our method
uses advanced graphical models to decode liquid PE proxies and incorporates
asymmetric risk adjustments that emulate private equity's unique performance
dynamics. The result is a liquid, scalable solution that aligns closely with
traditional quarterly PE benchmarks like Cambridge Associates and Preqin. This
approach enhances portfolio resilience and contributes to the ongoing discourse
on safe asset innovation, supporting market stability and investor confidence.

Motivation: 研究去中心化交易所（DEXs）中集中流动性机制如何改变传统市场中已充分研究的价格、流动性和订单流统计规律。

Method: 通过调查2023-2024年Uniswap v3中24个最活跃的流动性池，实证分析集中流动性对市场统计特征的影响。

Result: 发现了一系列新的统计规律，包括分布和交叉自相关函数的变化，这些变化与市场结构（如区块订单执行）和MEV活动（如即时流动性提供者和三明治攻击）相关。

Conclusion: 集中流动性机制在DEXs中产生了与传统市场不同的统计规律，这些规律反映了DEXs特有的市场结构和MEV活动特征。

Abstract: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are now a significant component of the
financial world where billions of dollars are traded daily. Differently from
traditional markets, which are typically based on Limit Order Books, DEXs
typically work as Automated Market Makers, and, since the implementation of
Uniswap v3, feature concentrated liquidity. By investigating the twenty-four
most active pools in Uniswap v3 during 2023 and 2024, we empirically study how
this structural change in the organization of the markets modifies the
well-studied stylized facts of prices, liquidity, and order flow observed in
traditional markets. We find a series of new statistical regularities in the
distributions and cross-autocorrelation functions of these variables that we
are able to associate either with the market structure (e.g., the execution of
orders in blocks) or with the intense activity of Maximal Extractable Value
searchers, such as Just-in-Time liquidity providers and sandwich attackers.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce PEARL (Private Equity Accessibility Reimagined
with Liquidity), an AI-powered framework designed to replicate and decode
private equity funds using liquid, cost-effective assets. Relying on previous
research methods such as Erik Stafford's single stock selection (Stafford) and
Thomson Reuters - Refinitiv's sector approach (TR), our approach incorporates
an additional asymmetry to capture the reduced volatility and better
performance of private equity funds resulting from sale timing, leverage, and
stock improvements through management changes. As a result, our model exhibits
a strong correlation with well-established liquid benchmarks such as Stafford
and TR, as well as listed private equity firms (Listed PE), while enhancing
performance to better align with renowned quarterly private equity benchmarks
like Cambridge Associates, Preqin, and Bloomberg Private Equity Fund indices.
Empirical findings validate that our two-step approachdecoding liquid daily
private equity proxies with a degree of negative return asymmetry outperforms
the initial daily proxies and yields performance more consistent with quarterly
private equity benchmarks.

systems are shaped by their epistemic framings: what aspects of work they
represent, and what they exclude. Drawing on an embedded study of AI
development for operating room (OR) scheduling at a Canadian hospital, we
compare scheduling-as-imagined in the AI design process: rule-bound,
predictable, and surgeon-centric, with scheduling-as-practiced as a fluid,
patient-facing coordination process involving ethical discretion. We show how
early representational decisions narrowed what the AI could support, resulting
in epistemic foreclosure: the premature exclusion of key ethical dimensions
from system design. Our findings surface the moral consequences of abstraction
and call for a more situated approach to designing healthcare
process-specialized artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: This study develops a comprehensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) Index with
seven primary dimensions, designed for provincial-level and industry-specific
analysis. We employ an anchor point method for data normalization, using fixed
upper and lower bounds as benchmarks, and devise a hierarchical indicator
weighting system that combines expert judgment with objective data. The index
draws from authoritative data sources across domains including official
statistics, patents and research outputs, education and talent, industrial
economy, policy and governance, and social impact. The China-US comparison
indicates that under a unified framework, the US composite score (68.1) exceeds
China's (59.4). We further dissect China into seven main areas to form a
sub-national index. The findings reveal stark regional disparities in China's
AI development: the North, East, and South regions lead in composite scores,
whereas central and western regions lag significantly, underscoring the effects
of regional concentration of innovation and industry resources. This research
provides an academic reference and decision support tool for government
agencies and research institutions, informing more targeted regional AI
development strategies.

TL;DR: 研究发现课堂编程练习可以显著提高对学生表现的早期预测能力，特别是在学期第3-5周就能相对准确地预测学生最终成绩，为早期干预提供可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机科学课程吸引了不同学术背景的学生，导致入门课程失败率上升，需要早期识别困难学生。课堂编程练习既能提供额外练习机会，又能帮助教师识别需要帮助的学生。

Method: 基于美国一所中型大学CS1课程的数据，分析课堂编程练习对学生表现预测能力的影响。

Result: 课堂练习能够改善对学生最终表现的预测，特别是在学期第3-5周就能获得相对准确的预测结果。

Conclusion: 这项研究为未来关于课堂练习影响和学期干预策略的研究提供了有益参考，有助于制定早期干预措施。

Abstract: Computer science's increased recognition as a prominent field of study has
attracted students with diverse academic backgrounds. This has significantly
increased the already high failure rates in introductory courses. To address
this challenge, it is essential to identify struggling students early on.
Incorporating in-class coding exercises in these courses not only offers
additional practice opportunities to students but may also reveal their
abilities and help teachers identify those in need of assistance. In this work,
we seek to determine the extent to which the practice of using in-class coding
exercises enhances the ability to predict student performance, especially early
in the semester. Based on data obtained in a CS1 course taught at a mid-size
American university, we found that in-class exercises could improve the
prediction of students' eventual performance. In particular, we found
relatively accurately predictions as early as academic weeks 3 through 5,
making it possible to devise early intervention strategies. This work can
benefit future studies on the impact of in-class exercises as well as
intervention strategies throughout the semester.

Abstract: As part of Rwanda's transition toward universal health coverage, the national
Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme is moving from retrospective
fee-for-service reimbursements to prospective capitation payments for public
primary healthcare providers. This report outlines a data-driven approach to
designing, calibrating, and monitoring the capitation model using
individual-level claims data from the Intelligent Health Benefits System
(IHBS). We introduce a transparent, interpretable formula for allocating
payments to Health Centers and their affiliated Health Posts. The formula is
based on catchment population, service utilization patterns, and patient
inflows, with parameters estimated via regression models calibrated on national
claims data. Repeated validation exercises show the payment scheme closely
aligns with historical spending while promoting fairness and adaptability
across diverse facilities. In addition to payment design, the same dataset
enables actionable behavioral insights. We highlight the use case of monitoring
antibiotic prescribing patterns, particularly in pediatric care, to flag
potential overuse and guideline deviations. Together, these capabilities lay
the groundwork for a learning health financing system: one that connects
digital infrastructure, resource allocation, and service quality to support
continuous improvement and evidence-informed policy reform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术通常与欺骗和虚假信息相关，但该技术具有改变人类感知的潜力，可能在医疗和教育等领域产生有益应用。需要理解该技术在不同学科中的概念化方式。

Method: 使用大型语言模型对2017-2025年的826篇同行评审文献进行内容分析，从身份来源、意图和操作粒度三个维度对深度伪造概念化进行分类。

Result: 研究发现概念化存在显著异质性，挑战了简化的公共叙事。部分研究讨论了非欺骗性应用，揭示了为社会造福的未开发潜力。时间分析显示从威胁导向观点向有益应用认知的演变。

Conclusion: 研究为制定区分应禁止和支持应用的细致治理和研究框架提供了实证基础，表明在适当保障下，深度伪造的真实感可以服务于欺骗之外的重要社会目的。

Abstract: Deepfake technologies are often associated with deception, misinformation,
and identity fraud, raising legitimate societal concerns. Yet such narratives
may obscure a key insight: deepfakes embody sophisticated capabilities for
sensory manipulation that can alter human perception, potentially enabling
beneficial applications in domains such as healthcare and education. Realizing
this potential, however, requires understanding how the technology is
conceptualized across disciplines. This paper analyzes 826 peer-reviewed
publications from 2017 to 2025 to examine how deepfakes are defined and
understood in the literature. Using large language models for content analysis,
we categorize deepfake conceptualizations along three dimensions: Identity
Source (the relationship between original and generated content), Intent
(deceptive versus non-deceptive purposes), and Manipulation Granularity
(holistic versus targeted modifications). Results reveal substantial
heterogeneity that challenges simplified public narratives. Notably, a subset
of studies discuss non-deceptive applications, highlighting an underexplored
potential for social good. Temporal analysis shows an evolution from
predominantly threat-focused views (2017 to 2019) toward recognition of
beneficial applications (2022 to 2025). This study provides an empirical
foundation for developing nuanced governance and research frameworks that
distinguish applications warranting prohibition from those deserving support,
showing that, with safeguards, deepfakes' realism can serve important social
purposes beyond deception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管批判性AI研究提供了重要的物质和社会技术批判，但可能忽视了LLMs在现象学层面如何重塑意义生成过程。

Method: 区分ML研究的三种知识兴趣（认识论、知识型、认识论实践），通过两个案例研究分析合成文本的风格标记，将风格作为符号学现象进行考察。

Result: 通过关注风格这一符号学现象，揭示了LLMs作为文化参与者如何改变当代话语中意义产生和传播的条件，独立于机器意识问题。

Conclusion: 需要将表面层面的风格分析与深度导向的批判相结合，以更好地理解LLMs在人类沟通中的现象学影响。

Abstract: Despite a potential plateau in ML advancement, the societal impact of large
language models lies not in approaching superintelligence but in generating
text surfaces indistinguishable from human writing. While Critical AI Studies
provides essential material and socio-technical critique, it risks overlooking
how LLMs phenomenologically reshape meaning-making. This paper proposes a
semiotics of "surface integrity" as attending to the immediate plane where LLMs
inscribe themselves into human communication. I distinguish three knowledge
interests in ML research (epistemology, epist\=em\=e, and epistemics) and argue
for integrating surface-level stylistic analysis alongside depth-oriented
critique. Through two case studies examining stylistic markers of synthetic
text, I argue how attending to style as a semiotic phenomenon reveals LLMs as
cultural actors that transform the conditions of meaning emergence and
circulation in contemporary discourse, independent of questions about machine
consciousness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在高等教育中带来了机遇和伦理教学挑战，研究旨在探索如何在STEM课程中有效使用AI工具，同时确保学术诚信和深度学习。

Method: 采用混合方法，包括可复现的文档分析和评分标准分析，对同一批学生进行两次干预：第一次失败后重新设计提示词和评估标准，第二次加入严格的过程控制。

Result: 第一次干预失败率100%，存在严重抄袭问题；重新设计后第二次干预中位数得分88/100，学生能够展示真实的学习过程。

Conclusion: 没有明确过程控制时，学生倾向于效率优先而非深度学习；提出了基于"可审计个人区域"的可转移评估协议，以促进高阶思维发展。

Abstract: The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has reshaped
higher education, presenting both opportunities and ethical-pedagogical
challenges. This article presents an empirical case study on the complete cycle
(design, initial failure, redesign, and re-evaluation) of an intervention using
an AI Tutor (ChatGPT) in the "Hydrology and Hydraulic Works" course (Civil
Engineering, UTN-FRT, Argentina). The study documents two interventions in the
same cohort (n=23). The first resulted in widespread failure (0% pass rate) due
to superficial use and serious academic integrity issues (65% similarity,
copies > 80%). This failure forced a comprehensive methodological redesign. The
second intervention, based on a redesigned prompt (Prompt V2) with strict
evidence controls (mandatory Appendix A with exported chat, minimum time $\geq$
120 minutes, verifiable numerical exercise) and a refined rubric (Rubric V2),
showed significantly better results: a median score of 88/100 and verifiable
compliance with genuine interaction processes. Using a mixed-methods approach
(reproducible document analysis and rubric analysis), the impact of the
redesign on integrity and technical performance is evaluated. The results
demonstrate that, without explicit process controls, students prioritize
efficiency over deep learning, submitting documents without real traceability.
A transferable assessment protocol for STEM courses is proposed, centered on
"auditable personal zones," to foster higher-order thinking. The study provides
key empirical evidence from the context of a public Latin American university.

Motivation: 解决高招生技术课程中报告评分面临的工作量大、客观性一致性不足、形成性反馈缺乏的问题，提升评分效率和质量。

Method: 采用生成式AI辅助评分系统，包括：使用详细评分标准校准大语言模型、批量处理作业、人工验证环节的人类监督模式。

Result: 评分时间减少88%，效率提升733%；反馈质量显著改善，评分标准覆盖率达100%，基于文本证据的评论增加150%；系统公平无偏见，校准后可靠性高（r=0.96）。

Conclusion: AI-教师混合模型优化了评估过程，释放了高价值教学任务时间，提升了反馈的公平性和质量，符合UNESCO教育AI伦理使用原则。

Abstract: In technical subjects characterized by high enrollment, such as Basic
Hydraulics, the assessment of reports necessitates superior levels of
objectivity, consistency, and formative feedback; goals often compromised by
faculty workload. This study presents the implementation of a generative
artificial intelligence (AI) assisted assessment system, supervised by
instructors, to grade 33 hydraulics reports. The central objective was to
quantify its impact on the efficiency, quality, and fairness of the process.
The employed methodology included the calibration of the Large Language Model
(LLM) with a detailed rubric, the batch processing of assignments, and a
human-in-the-loop validation phase. The quantitative results revealed a
noteworthy 88% reduction in grading time (from 50 to 6 minutes per report,
including verification) and a 733% increase in productivity. The quality of
feedback was substantially improved, evidenced by 100% rubric coverage and a
150% increase in the anchoring of comments to textual evidence. The system
proved to be equitable, exhibiting no bias related to report length, and highly
reliable post-calibration (r = 0.96 between scores). It is concluded that the
hybrid AI-instructor model optimizes the assessment process, thereby liberating
time for high-value pedagogical tasks and enhancing the fairness and quality of
feedback, in alignment with UNESCO's principles on the ethical use of AI in
education.

Motivation: 当前机器学习研究通常从互联网抓取裸体图像来训练模型，但这些内容是在未经同意的情况下收集和分发的，可能导致滥用并加剧对被拍摄者的伤害。

Method: 通过对计算领域发表的使用裸体图像的论文进行系统性回顾，分析该问题的范围和性质。

Result: 研究发现裸体图像使用规范严重缺失，导致许多问题实践，如分发和发布未打码的裸体图像、故意收集和分享虐待内容等。

Conclusion: 呼吁出版机构和研究社区停止非自愿使用裸体图像，并提出了平衡用户自主权与具体研究目标的裸体检测研究愿景。

Abstract: In order to train, test, and evaluate nudity detection models, machine
learning researchers typically rely on nude images scraped from the Internet.
Our research finds that this content is collected and, in some cases,
subsequently distributed by researchers without consent, leading to potential
misuse and exacerbating harm against the subjects depicted. This position paper
argues that the distribution of nonconsensually collected nude images by
researchers perpetuates image-based sexual abuse and that the machine learning
community should stop the nonconsensual use of nude images in research. To
characterize the scope and nature of this problem, we conducted a systematic
review of papers published in computing venues that collect and use nude
images. Our results paint a grim reality: norms around the usage of nude images
are sparse, leading to a litany of problematic practices like distributing and
publishing nude images with uncensored faces, and intentionally collecting and
sharing abusive content. We conclude with a call-to-action for publishing
venues and a vision for research in nudity detection that balances user agency
with concrete research objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识追踪模型主要关注离散知识点的掌握，难以刻画更广泛的素养发展。需要开发能够建模高阶认知能力和素养发展的新范式。

Method: 提出了素养追踪范式，并基于Transformer构建了TLSQKT模型，采用双通道设计联合编码学生回答和题目语义，利用问题感知交互和自注意力捕捉学习者状态的长程依赖关系。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，TLSQKT在素养导向指标上持续优于强基线模型，并能揭示学习者素养发展的可解释轨迹。迁移实验表明知识追踪信号可用于素养追踪。

Conclusion: 素养追踪可作为智能教育系统的可扩展组件，为未来大规模教育模型中的素养评估奠定基础。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) supports personalized learning by modeling how
students' knowledge states evolve over time. However, most KT models emphasize
mastery of discrete knowledge components, limiting their ability to
characterize broader literacy development. We reframe the task as Literacy
Tracing (LT), which models the growth of higher-order cognitive abilities and
literacy from learners' interaction sequences, and we instantiate this paradigm
with a Transformer-based model, TLSQKT (Transformer for Learning Sequences with
Question-Aware Knowledge Tracing). TLSQKT employs a dual-channel design that
jointly encodes student responses and item semantics, while question-aware
interaction and self-attention capture long-range dependencies in learners'
evolving states. Experiments on three real-world datasets - one public
benchmark, one private knowledge-component dataset, and one private literacy
dataset - show that TLSQKT consistently outperforms strong KT baselines on
literacy-oriented metrics and reveals interpretable developmental trajectories
of learners' literacy. Transfer experiments further indicate that
knowledge-tracing signals can be leveraged for literacy tracing, offering a
practical route when dedicated literacy labels are limited. These findings
position literacy tracing as a scalable component of intelligent educational
systems and lay the groundwork for literacy evaluation in future large-scale
educational models.

Motivation: 全球对STEM技术专业人才需求增长，但女性技术专业人员短缺且难以吸引和保留。现有研究主要关注高中毕业生，缺乏关于女性转行或提升技能进入ICT职业的研究。

Method: 这是一篇综述研究，通过分析现有文献来回答"影响女性转行或提升技能进入技术导向STEM职业的潜在驱动因素和障碍是什么"的问题。

Result: 研究发现：职业不满结合工作场所积极计算体验能激发对计算职业的兴趣；从重要参考者那里了解职业机会是关键驱动力；女性需要克服负面身份认同、学术信念和自我怀疑才能成功转行。

Conclusion: 通过利用女性对计算的潜在兴趣，可以增加和多样化技术劳动力。该综述为支持教育机构、雇主和女性从技能提升机会中受益提供了研究路线图。

Abstract: Demand for technology focused STEM professionals will increase globally over
the coming decade, with many countries finding it difficult to meet growing
demand. Compounding this are difficulties in attracting and retaining female
technology-focused professionals. Research seeking to address this gender
imbalance and workforce shortage focuses on increasing participation among
school leavers. However, there is a paucity of research around the potential
for females to upskill or reskill into an ICT career. As a starting point, this
review asks the question: "What potential drivers and barriers have been
identified that impact on female intentions or choices to reskill or upskill to
a technology focused STEM career". Results indicate dissatisfaction in a first
career, combined with positive computing experiences in the workplace can rouse
interest in computing professions. Learning of job opportunities, especially
from salient referents, is also a key driver. Results indicate women must
overcome negative identity and academic beliefs, as well as self-doubt to make
the switch. In summary, it is possible to increase and diversify the tech
workforce by leveraging women's latent interest in computing. This review
provides a roadmap for research to support educational institutions, employers,
and women to benefit from upskilling or reskilling opportunities

Abstract: Low-power Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are becoming increasingly
important in engineering education as a tool to help students connect theory to
real applications. However, many institutions face barriers that slow down
their adoption in courses and labs. This paper reviews recent studies to
understand these barriers and organizes them into three groups: technical,
organizational, and curricular/pedagogical. Technical barriers include energy
management, scalability, and integration issues. Organizational barriers are
related to cost, planning, and the need for trained staff. Curricular and
pedagogical barriers include gaps in student readiness, limited lab time, and
platform choices that depend on budget. By detailing these barriers with
practical examples, this paper aims to help educators and academic leaders
develop more effective strategies to adopt low-power IoT in engineering
programs.

Motivation: 当前AI和LLM被宣传为减轻公设辩护人工作负担的工具，但这些提议脱离实际。研究旨在填补这一空白，了解公设辩护人对AI的真实体验和关切。

Method: 采用半结构化访谈方法，对美国14名公设辩护从业者进行访谈，考察他们对AI的体验、预期应用和伦理担忧。

Result: 发现AI采用受成本、办公室规范、保密风险和工具质量限制。公设辩护人认为AI在证据调查中最有用，在法庭辩护和策略制定中最不适用。

Conclusion: 提出了负责任使用AI的保障措施，包括强制人工验证、限制过度依赖，以及保护律师工作的关系性。建议优先开发开源模型、领域特定数据集和参与式设计的研究议程。

Abstract: Public defenders are asked to do more with less: representing clients
deserving of adequate counsel while facing overwhelming caseloads and scarce
resources. While artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs)
are promoted as tools to alleviate this burden, such proposals are detached
from the lived realities of public defenders. This study addresses that gap
through semi-structured interviews with fourteen practitioners across the
United States to examine their experiences with AI, anticipated applications,
and ethical concerns. We find that AI adoption is constrained by costs,
restrictive office norms, confidentiality risks, and unsatisfactory tool
quality. To clarify where AI can and cannot contribute, we propose a task-level
map of public defense. Public defenders view AI as most useful for evidence
investigation to analyze overwhelming amounts of digital records, with narrower
roles in legal research & writing, and client communication. Courtroom
representation and defense strategy are considered least compatible with AI
assistance, as they depend on contextual judgment and trust. Public defenders
emphasize safeguards for responsible use, including mandatory human
verification, limits on overreliance, and the preservation of relational aspect
of lawyering. Building on these findings, we outline a research agenda that
promotes equitable access to justice by prioritizing open-source models,
domain-specific datasets and evaluation, and participatory design that
incorporates defenders' perspectives into system development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于NLP进展和社会心理学文献，探索在社交媒体环境中通过反刻板印象策略来减轻性别偏见的实际效果。

Method: 使用两种反刻板印象策略（反事实和扩展普遍性），通过内隐联想测试、自我报告的显性偏见和感知效用测量，评估不同人口群体（性别和年龄）的反应。

Result: 整体偏见减少有限，但某些群体（如年长男性）在内隐偏见方面有改善，而年轻参与者（特别是女性）对相同干预措施表现出偏见增加。

Conclusion: 刻板印象缓解具有复杂性和身份敏感性，需要动态和情境感知的评估与缓解策略。

Abstract: We investigate the effect of automatically generated counter-stereotypes on
gender bias held by users of various demographics on social media. Building on
recent NLP advancements and social psychology literature, we evaluate two
counter-stereotype strategies -- counter-facts and broadening universals (i.e.,
stating that anyone can have a trait regardless of group membership) -- which
have been identified as the most potentially effective in previous studies. We
assess the real-world impact of these strategies on mitigating gender bias
across user demographics (gender and age), through the Implicit Association
Test and the self-reported measures of explicit bias and perceived utility. Our
findings reveal that actual effectiveness does not align with perceived
effectiveness, and the former is a nuanced and sometimes divergent phenomenon
across demographic groups. While overall bias reduction was limited, certain
groups (e.g., older, male participants) exhibited measurable improvements in
implicit bias in response to some interventions. Conversely, younger
participants, especially women, showed increasing bias in response to the same
interventions. These results highlight the complex and identity-sensitive
nature of stereotype mitigation and call for dynamic and context-aware
evaluation and mitigation strategies.

alphabet, where series and parallel composition induce an $m$-topology on
$m$-graphs with a theta mapping $\vartheta$ that preserves one-port
equivalence. The study formalizes quasi-orders, shells, and cores, showing
their structural correspondence to network boundary conditions and impedance
behavior. The $\lambda--\Delta$ metric, together with the valuation morphism
$\Phi$, provides a concise descriptor of the impedance-degree structure. In the
computational domain, the framework is extended with algorithmic procedures for
generating and classifying non-isomorphic series-parallel topologies,
accompanied by programmatic Cauer/Foster synthesis workflows and validation
against canonical examples from Ladenheim's catalogue. The resulting approach
enables symbolic-to-topological translation of impedance functions, offering a
constructive bridge between algebraic representation and electrical
realization. Overall, the paper outlines a self-consistent theoretical and
computational foundation for automated network synthesis, classification, and
formal verification within the emerging field of Jorbology.

*Yijin Wang,Subhonmesh Bose*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一个包含价格因素的Bass扩散模型推广版本，用于研究垄断企业的最优定价策略和政策制定者与垄断企业之间的博弈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型未能充分体现价格对产品采纳的影响，需要开发一个能够更好拟合实际采纳数据并支持决策分析的模型。

Method: 开发了离散时间下包含价格因素的Bass扩散模型推广版本，并应用于两个决策问题：垄断企业的最优定价策略和政策制定者与垄断企业之间的Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 为单期问题完全刻画了最优定价策略，为多期问题建立了结构性质；在博弈问题中分析了均衡路径的关键性质。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型能够有效分析价格对产品采纳的影响，并为相关决策问题提供理论支持。

Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Bass diffusion model in discrete-time that
explicitly models the effect of price in adoption. Our model is different from
earlier price-incorporated models and fits well to adoption data for various
products. We then utilize this model to study two decision-making problems.
First, we provide a series of structural results on optimal pricing strategies
to maximize profits from product sales by a monopolist over a finite horizon.
We fully characterize the optimal pricing strategy in the single-period
problem, and establish several structural properties of the same for the
multi-period counterpart. Second, we study a Stackelberg game between a
policy-maker and a monopolist, where the former seeks to maximize adoption
through rebates, while the latter focuses on profits. For this problem, we
analytically characterize crucial properties of the equilibrium path of the
single-period game, and demonstrate how they carry over to the multi-period
variant.

Abstract: We present an algorithm for planning trajectories that avoid obstacles and
satisfy key-door precedence specifications expressed with a fragment of signal
temporal logic. Our method includes a novel exact convex partitioning of the
obstacle free space that encodes connectivity among convex free space sets, key
sets, and door sets. We then construct an augmented graph of convex sets that
exactly encodes the key-door precedence specifications. By solving a shortest
path problem in this augmented graph of convex sets, our pipeline provides an
exact solution up to a finite parameterization of the trajectory. To illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach, we present a method to generate key-door
mazes that provide challenging problem instances, and we perform numerical
experiments to evaluate the proposed pipeline. Our pipeline is faster by
several orders of magnitude than recent state-of-the art methods that use
general purpose temporal logic tools.

Abstract: Conventional AC Power Flow (ACPF) solvers like Newton-Raphson (NR) face
significant computational and convergence challenges in modern, large-scale
power systems. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid method that
integrates a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a robust,
iterative Linear State Estimation (LSE) refinement step to produce fast and
physically-consistent solutions. The GNN, trained with a physics-informed loss
function featuring an efficient dynamic weighting scheme, rapidly predicts a
high-quality initial system state. This prediction is then refined using an
iterative, direct linear solver inspired by state estimation techniques. This
LSE refinement step solves a series of linear equations to enforce physical
laws, effectively bypassing the non-linearities and convergence issues of
traditional solvers. The proposed GNN-LSE framework is comprehensively
validated on systems ranging from small radial distribution networks (IEEE
33-bus, 69-bus) to a large, meshed transmission system (IEEE 118-bus). Results
show that our GNN variants are up to $8.4 \times 10^3$ times faster than NR.
The LSE refinement provides a fast route to a physically-consistent solution,
while heavy-loading stress tests (120%-150% of nominal) and N-1 contingencies
demonstrate the method's reliability and generalization. This work presents a
powerful and flexible framework for bridging fast, data-driven models with the
rigorous constraints of power system physics, offering a practical tool for
real-time operations and analysis.

Abstract: This paper suggests a novel rotor-cooling shaft concept for high-performance
electric motors that increases the effectiveness of cooling and is yet simple
and cost-effective to manufacture. We investigate the thermal performance of
four shaft geometries for rotor cooling in automotive applications. The
proposed tooth-guided liquid-cooling shaft design aims to solve the high
churning loss of conventional cooled rotor shafts due to internal vortex
formation and their still limited heat transfer. Therefore, we optimize heat
transfer efficiency and pressure management by incorporating cold-formed
internal channels that restrict vortex formation beyond a degree that improves
heat transfer. We evaluated key performance metrics, including heat transfer
rate, outlet temperature, pressure drop, and velocity profiles, under varying
rotational speeds, inlet flow rates, and coolant temperatures. Computational
fluid analysis demonstrates that the tooth-guided design outperforms
conventional hollow shafts and achieves up to 110% higher cooling efficiency at
low rotational speeds, while it maintains comparable pressure levels. These
findings provide practical insight into geometry-driven thermal optimization
and offer a path toward improving the performance and durability of electric
motors.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种数据高效、面向控制的建模方法，适用于需要准确轨迹灵敏度预测的动态系统。

Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems is crucial across the science and engineering
fields for accurate prediction, control, and decision-making. Recently, machine
learning (ML) approaches, particularly neural ordinary differential equations
(NODEs), have emerged as a powerful tool for data-driven modeling of
continuous-time dynamics. Nevertheless, standard NODEs require a large number
of data samples to remain consistent under varying control inputs, posing
challenges to generate sufficient simulated data and ensure the safety of
control design. To address this gap, we propose trajectory-sensitivity-aware
(TRASE-)NODEs, which construct an augmented system for both state and
sensitivity, enabling simultaneous learning of their dynamics. This formulation
allows the adjoint method to update gradients in a memory-efficient manner and
ensures that control-input effects are captured in the learned dynamics. We
evaluate TRASE-NODEs using damped oscillator and inverter-based resources
(IBRs). The results show that TRASE-NODEs generalize better from the limited
training data, yielding lower prediction errors than standard NODEs for both
examples. The proposed framework offers a data-efficient, control-oriented
modeling approach suitable for dynamic systems that require accurate trajectory
sensitivity prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层优化模型，通过考虑配电节点边际电价（DLMPs）的影响，实现能源社区运营成本分配的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着能源社区规模扩大和电网整合，如何在考虑DLMPs影响的情况下公平分配运营成本成为挑战。现有方法大多未考虑DLMPs的影响。

Method: 建立双层优化模型：上层由社区能源聚合商调度分布式能源资源，下层由配电系统运营商通过网络约束调度确定DLMPs。利用KKT条件和强对偶性将双层模型转化为单层问题，并应用Shapley值量化各社区对系统成本节约的边际贡献。

Result: 在多个基准配电系统上的仿真验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够考虑DLMPs的影响，实现能源社区运营成本的公平分配。

Abstract: Energy communities (ECs) are emerging as a promising decentralized model for
managing cooperative distributed energy resources (DERs). As these communities
expand and their operations become increasingly integrated into the grid,
ensuring fairness in allocating operating costs among participants becomes a
challenge. In distribution networks, DER operations at the community level can
influence Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMPs), which in turn affect
system's operation cost. This interdependence between local decisions and
system-level pricing introduces new challenges for fair and transparent cost
allocation. Despite growing interest in fairness-aware methods, most methods do
not account for the impact of DLMPs. To fill this gap, we propose a bilevel
optimization model in which a Community Energy Aggregator (CEA) schedules DERs
across multiple ECs while a Distribution System Operator (DSO) determines DLMPs
through network-constrained dispatch. Leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions and strong duality, the bilevel model is reformulated into a
tractable single-level problem. We achieve fairness in the cost allocation by
applying the Shapley value to quantify each community's marginal contribution
to system-wide cost savings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
validated through simulations on several benchmark distribution systems.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提高电力系统的暂态稳定性，且不需要电网动态模型，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: The integration of converter-interfaced generation introduces new transient
stability challenges to modern power systems. Classical Lyapunov- and scalable
passivity-based approaches typically rely on restrictive assumptions, and
finding storage functions for large grids is generally considered intractable.
Furthermore, most methods require an accurate grid dynamics model. To address
these challenges, we propose a model-free, nonlinear, and dissipativity-based
controller which, when applied to grid-connected virtual synchronous generators
(VSGs), enhances power system transient stability. Using input-state data, we
train neural networks to learn dissipativity-characterizing matrices that yield
stabilizing controllers. Furthermore, we incorporate cost function shaping to
improve the performance with respect to the user-specified objectives.
Numerical results on a modified, all-VSG Kundur two-area power system validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper combines vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vRKHS)

plant model considered in this paper also suffers from unmatched uncertainties.
Finally, the measured output is affected by disturbances as well. Upper bounds
on the state observation error are provided in an analytical form. The proposed
theoretical results are applied to the problem of estimating the state of a
rigid body.

Conclusion: 所提出的复合控制器有效解决了电动汽车接入直流微电网时的稳定性和低惯量问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: When electric vehicles (EVs) are integrated into standalone DC microgrids
(DCMGs), stability issues arise due to their constant power load (CPL)
behavior, which provides negative incremental impedance (NII). In addition, the
microgrids suffer from an inherent low-inertia problem. Therefore, this study
presents a composite controller incorporating a global integral terminal
sliding mode controller with a backstepping controller. A virtual capacitor is
employed to mitigate the low-inertia issue and strengthen the DC-bus response.
An improved fractional power-based reaching law decreases chattering and
accelerates convergence. Exact feedback linearization converts the nonlinear
boost converter model into Brunovsky's canonical form, mitigating NII effects
and non-minimum phase issues. The entire system stability is verified using
Lyapunov control theory. Simulation outcomes confirm superior performance, with
34.4-53.3% reduction in overshoot, 52.9-74.9% in undershoot, and 12-47.4% in
settling time compared to the existing controller.

Abstract: The rapid increase in renewable energy sources (RES) implementation in the
power system creates more severe network congestion, which may reduce grid
operation efficiency and cause renewable curtailment. Deterministic
optimization for the unit commitment shows that battery energy storage system
(BESS)-based Virtual Transmission Line (VTL), as an alternative to physical
transmission lines, can offer a quick solution for congestion relief, reduced
operational costs, and lowered renewable curtailment. This paper aims to
evaluate the benefits of VTL when considering Renewable Energy Sources
uncertainty. Particularly, this work proposes a scenario-based stochastic
security-constrained unit commitment model considering VTL, referred to as
SSCUC-VTL. It incorporates the forecast error of RES into the commitment
decision for systems with VTL. The performance of applying the VTL strategy is
compared to that of adding a new physical transmission line and a standalone
BESS. A case study has been conducted on an enhanced IEEE 24-bus test system.
The simulation results demonstrate that VTL provides 23% more operational cost
reduction than the physical transmission line, and up to 67% more congestion
relief than the standalone BESS in a power system with solar and wind
generation.

Abstract: This paper presents a constructive framework for synthesizing provably safe
controllers for nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to bounded disturbances.
The methodology applies to systems representable in Brunovsky canonical form,
accommodating arbitrary-order dynamics in multi-dimensional spaces. The central
contribution is a method of constraint tightening that formally couples robust
error feedback with nominal trajectory planning. The key insight is that the
design of an ancillary feedback law, which confines state errors to a robust
positively invariant (RPI) tube, simultaneously provides the exact information
needed to ensure the safety of the nominal plan. Specifically, the geometry of
the resulting RPI tube is leveraged via its support function to derive
state-dependent safety margins. These margins are then used to systematically
tighten the high relative-degree exponential control barrier function (eCBF)
constraints imposed on the nominal planner. This integrated synthesis
guarantees that any nominal trajectory satisfying the tightened constraints
corresponds to a provably safe trajectory for the true, disturbed system. We
demonstrate the practical utility of this formal synthesis method by
implementing the planner within a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC)
scheme, which optimizes performance while inheriting the robust safety
guarantees.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an optimally structured gradient coding scheme to
mitigate the straggler problem in distributed learning. Conventional gradient
coding methods often assume homogeneous straggler models or rely on excessive
data replication, limiting performance in real-world heterogeneous systems. To
address these limitations, we formulate an optimization problem minimizing
residual error while ensuring unbiased gradient estimation by explicitly
considering individual straggler probabilities. We derive closed-form solutions
for optimal encoding and decoding coefficients via Lagrangian duality and
convex optimization, and propose data allocation strategies that reduce both
redundancy and computation load. We also analyze convergence behavior for
$\lambda$-strongly convex and $\mu$-smooth loss functions. Numerical results
show that our approach significantly reduces the impact of stragglers and
accelerates convergence compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This paper presents an ellipsoidal set-theoretic framework for robust safety
filter synthesis in constrained linear systems subject to additive bounded
disturbances and input constraints. We formulate the safety filter design as a
convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem that simultaneously
computes a robust controlled invariant (RCI) ellipsoidal set and its associated
state-feedback control law. The RCI set is characterized as an ellipsoidal set,
enabling computational tractability for high-dimensional systems while
providing formal safety guarantees. The safety filter employs a smooth mixing
strategy between nominal and backup controllers based on distance to the
invariant set boundary, facilitating minimal intervention when the system
operates safely. The proposed method extends to nonlinear systems by treating
nonlinear terms as bounded disturbances with rigorous approximation bounds.
Numerical validation on a six-degree-of-freedom quadrotor system demonstrates
the filter's effectiveness in maintaining stability under external disturbances
and aggressive maneuvers while preserving nominal performance during safe
operation. The approach provides a constructive and computationally efficient
solution for safety-critical control applications requiring real-time
implementation.

from electrochemical state estimation. One EKF estimates the system states of a
control-oriented parameter-grouped single particle model with thermal effects,
while the other EKF estimates a residual bias that continuously corrects the
voltage observation equation, thereby refining the model-predicted voltage in
real time. Unlike bias-augmented single-filter schemes that enlarge the
covariance coupling, the decoupled bias estimator refines the voltage
observation without perturbing electrochemical state dynamics. Validation is
conducted on an LFP cell from a public dataset under three representative
operating conditions: US06 at 0 degC, DST at 25 degC, and FUDS at 50 degC.
Compared with a conventional EKF using the same model and identical state
filter settings, the proposed method reduces the average SOC RMSE from 3.75% to
0.20% and the voltage RMSE between the filtered model voltage and the measured
voltage from 32.8 mV to 0.8 mV. The improvement is most evident in the mid-SOC
range where the OCV-SOC curve is flat, confirming that residual bias
compensation significantly enhances accuracy for model-based SOC estimation of
LFP batteries across a wide temperature range.

*Shuang Gao,Peter E. Caines*

TL;DR: TransNNs可作为病毒传播模型的上界近似，并用于设计计算效率更高的滚动时域控制方法，相比动态规划和最优控制有显著计算优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统马尔可夫SIS模型状态空间随节点数指数增长（2^n），计算复杂度高，需要寻找更高效的近似和控制方法。

Method: 使用TransNNs作为马尔可夫SIS模型的近似，提出基于TransNN的滚动时域控制方法。

Result: TransNNs能提供感染概率的上界，提出的控制方法相比动态规划显著节省计算量，且比TransNN最优控制更不保守。

Conclusion: TransNNs是有效的病毒传播近似模型，基于其的滚动时域控制兼具计算效率和性能优势。

Abstract: Transmission Neural Networks (TransNNs) proposed by Gao and Caines (2022)
serve as both virus spread models over networks and neural network models with
tuneable activation functions. This paper establishes that TransNNs provide
upper bounds on the infection probability generated from the associated
Markovian stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model with 2^n
state configurations where n is the number of nodes in the network, and can be
employed as an approximate model for the latter. Based on such an
approximation, a TransNN-based receding horizon control approach for mitigating
virus spread is proposed and we demonstrate that it allows significant
computational savings compared to the dynamic programming solution to Markovian
SIS model with 2^n state configurations, as well as providing less conservative
control actions compared to the TransNN-based optimal control. Finally,
numerical comparisons among (a) dynamic programming solutions for the Markovian
SIS model, (b) TransNN-based optimal control and (c) the proposed TransNN-based
receding horizon control are presented.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出NeuroDOB，一种基于深度神经网络的车辆横向动力学观测控制器，用DNN替代传统扰动观测器，通过从驾驶员在环仿真中学习转向补偿信号来增强个性化横向控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扰动观测器只能补偿一般扰动，无法处理未建模的车辆动力学和驾驶员特定行为。NeuroDOB旨在通过深度学习实现个性化自适应控制。

Method: 将NeuroDOB与线性二次调节器集成，DNN输出误差修正量加到基线LQR转向输入中。输入特征包括横向位置和偏航角误差，以及LQR控制输入。

Result: 在CarSim中使用横向动态自行车模型的实验验证表明，NeuroDOB能有效适应个体驾驶习惯，超越传统LQR控制器的横向控制性能。

Conclusion: 基于深度神经网络的观测器具有实现个性化自适应自动驾驶控制的潜力，架构可视为双系统控制结构，结合了模型基础的稳定性和数据驱动的适应性。

Abstract: This paper proposes NeuroDOB, a deep neural network based observer controller
for vehicle lateral dynamics, which replaces the conventional disturbance
observer (DOB) with a deep neural network (DNN) to enhance personalized lateral
control. Unlike conventional DOBs that compensate for general disturbances such
as road friction variation and crosswind, NeuroDOB explicitly addresses
unmodeled vehicle dynamics and driver-specific behaviors by learning the
steering compensation signal from driver-in-the-loop simulations using CarSim's
embedded controller as a surrogate driver. The proposed architecture integrates
NeuroDOB with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR), where the DNN outputs a delta
error correction added to the baseline LQR steering input to produce the final
control command. Input features to the DNN include lateral position and yaw
angle errors, and the LQR control input. Experimental validation using a
lateral dynamic bicycle model within CarSim demonstrates that NeuroDOB
effectively adapts to individual driving habits, improving lateral control
performance beyond what conventional LQR controllers achieve. The results
indicate the potential of deep neural network based observer to enable
personalized and adaptive autonomous vehicle control. In cognitive terms, the
proposed architecture can be viewed as a dual-system control structure. The
baseline LQR corresponds to System 1, a model-based, fast, and analytic
reasoning layer ensuring stability. The NeuroDOB acts as System 2, a
reflective, data-driven layer that learns compensation from experience and
corrects the analytical bias of System 1. Together, they form an integrated
decision process analogous to human intuition-reflection interaction, enabling
both stability and adaptability in lateral control.

Abstract: Dependability is the ability to consistently deliver trusted and
uninterrupted service in the face of operational uncertainties. Ensuring
dependable operation in large-scale, energy-constrained Internet of Things
(IoT) deployments is as crucial as challenging, and calls for context-aware
protocols where context refers to situational or state information. In this
paper, we identify four critical context dimensions for IoT networks, namely
energy status, information freshness, task relevance, and physical/medium
conditions, and show how each one underpins core dependability attributes.
Building on these insights, we propose a two-step protocol design framework
that incorporates operation-specific context fields. Through three
representative use cases, we demonstrate how context awareness can
significantly enhance system dependability while imposing only minimal
control-plane overhead.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Embroidery Actuator, a fabric-integrated
pneumatic actuator that enables diverse and controllable deformations through
embroidery pattern design. Unlike conventional fabric actuators that rely on
fiber- or thread-shaped actuators, the proposed actuator is fabricated by
directly stitching an inflatable tube onto the fabric using a cord-embroidery
technique. The embroidered thread and the fabric jointly form a sleeve that
constrains the expansion of the inflatable tube, converting internal pressure
into targeted bending or stretching deformations. By varying the embroidery
pattern, such as zigzag or cross configurations, different geometric
constraints can be realized, allowing for flexible control of deformation
direction and magnitude. Analytical deformation models based on the Neo-Hookean
model and Lagrange's equations were developed to predict the relationship
between pneumatic pressure and bending angle, and were experimentally validated
using motion-capture measurements. The results demonstrated that the actuator
achieves strong agreement with the analytical deformation model.

Motivation: AC最优潮流问题对电力系统运行至关重要，但由于其非凸和非线性特性而难以高效求解。神经网络提供快速代理，但其黑盒行为引发对可能危及安全的约束违规的担忧。

Method: 采用验证感知的神经网络框架，将最坏情况约束违规直接整合到训练过程中，结合后验验证，并通过恢复和热启动策略增强实际可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了机器学习加速与AC-OPF解决方案安全实时部署之间的差距，为数据驱动的最优控制铺平了道路。

Abstract: The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem is central to power system
operation but challenging to solve efficiently due to its nonconvex and
nonlinear nature. Neural networks (NNs) offer fast surrogates, yet their
black-box behavior raises concerns about constraint violations that can
compromise safety. We propose a verification-informed NN framework that
incorporates worst-case constraint violations directly into training, producing
models that are both accurate and provably safer. Through post-hoc
verification, we achieve substantial reductions in worst-case violations and,
for the first time, verify all operational constraints of large-scale AC-OPF
proxies. Practical feasibility is further enhanced via restoration and
warm-start strategies for infeasible operating points. Experiments on systems
ranging from 57 to 793 buses demonstrate scalability, speed, and reliability,
bridging the gap between ML acceleration and safe, real-time deployment of
AC-OPF solutions - and paving the way toward data-driven optimal control.

Conclusion: 该模块化控制框架能够有效处理闭链多体系统，避免了传统方法的复杂性，在轨迹跟踪控制方面展现出良好的应用前景和可扩展性。

Abstract: A novel modular control framework for reconfigurable rigid multibody systems
is proposed, motivated by the challenges of modular control of systems with
closed kinematic chains. In the framework, modularity is defined in the sense
of degrees of freedom, and the inertial properties of each body are partitioned
with respect to how they are reflected in the kinetic energy of the system
through the motion induced by each degree of freedom. This approach inherently
handles closed chains in the same manner as tree-like structures, eliminating
the need for explicit constraint force calculations or formulations based on
differential-algebraic equations. The proposed framework is implemented via
simulation on a three-degree-of-freedom series-parallel manipulator, with the
results being consistent with the expected stability and tracking performance,
and indicating the framework's potential for scalability in trajectory-tracking
control of multibody systems.

Abstract: Cable-suspended aerial transportation systems are employed extensively across
various industries. The capability to flexibly adjust the relative position
between the multirotor and the payload has spurred growing interest in the
system equipped with variable-length cable, promising broader application
potential. Compared to systems with fixed-length cables, introducing the
variable-length cable adds a new degree of freedom. However, it also results in
increased nonlinearity and more complex dynamic coupling among the multirotor,
the cable and the payload, posing significant challenges in control design.
This paper introduces a backstepping control strategy tailored for aerial
transportation systems with variable-length cable, designed to precisely track
the payload trajectory while dynamically adjusting cable length. Then, a cable
length generator has been developed that achieves online optimization of the
cable length while satisfying state constraints, thus balancing the
multirotor's motion and cable length changes without the need for manual
trajectory planning. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is
guaranteed through Lyapunov techniques and the growth restriction condition.
Finally, simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in
managing trajectory tracking and cable length adjustments effectively.

Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptive control of a class of feedback
linearizable plants with matched parametric uncertainties whose states are
accessible, subject to state constraints, which often arise due to safety
considerations. In this paper, we combine adaptation and control barrier
functions into a real-time control architecture that guarantees stability,
ensures control performance, and remains safe even with the parametric
uncertainties. Two problems are considered, differing in the nature of the
parametric uncertainties. In both cases, the control barrier function is
assumed to have an arbitrary relative degree. In addition to guaranteeing
stability, it is proved that both the control objective and safety objective
are met with near-zero conservatism. No excitation conditions are imposed on
the command signal. Simulation results demonstrate the non-conservatism of all
of the theoretical developments.

Abstract: The intermittent nature of renewable power availability is one of the major
sources of uncertainty in power systems. While markets can guarantee that the
demand is covered by the available generation, transmission system operators
have to often intervene via economic redispatch to ensure that the physical
constraints of the network are satisfied. To account for uncertainty, the
underlying optimal power flow (OPF) routines have to be modified. Recently,
polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) has been suggested in the literature as a tool
for stochastic OPF problems. However, the usage of PCE-based methods in
security-constrained OPF for (N-1)-secure operations has not yet been explored.
In this paper, we propose a procedure that iteratively solves a PCE-overloaded
stochastic OPF problem by including line outage constraints until an
(N-1)-secure solution is achieved. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by
comparing it with a Monte-Carlo simulation on a 118-bus example system.

Abstract: We formulate and solve the fixed horizon linear quadratic covariance steering
problem in continuous time with a terminal cost measured in Hilbert-Schmidt
(i.e., Frobenius) norm error between the desired and the controlled terminal
covariances. For this problem, the necessary conditions of optimality become a
coupled matrix ODE two-point boundary value problem. To solve this system of
equations, we design a matricial recursive algorithm and prove its convergence.
The proposed algorithm and its analysis make use of the linear fractional
transforms parameterized by the state transition matrix of the associated
Hamiltonian matrix. To illustrate the results, we provide two numerical

Conclusion: 提出的公式能有效减少线性协方差控制器在非线性环境中的误差，通过凸优化方法实现高效求解，提高了控制器在非线性系统中的性能。

Abstract: Applying linear controllers to nonlinear systems requires the dynamical
linearization about a reference. In highly nonlinear environments such as
cislunar space, the region of validity for these linearizations varies widely
and can negatively affect controller performance if not carefully formulated.
This paper presents a formulation that minimizes the nonlinear errors
experienced by linear covariance controllers. The formulation involves
upper-bounding the remainder term from the linearization process using
higher-order terms in a Taylor series expansion, and resolving it into a convex
function. This can serve as a cost function for controller gain optimization,
and its convex nature allows for efficient solutions through convex
optimization. This formulation is then demonstrated and compared with the
current methods within a halo orbit stationkeeping scenario. The results show
that the formulation proposed in this paper maintains the Gaussianity of the
distribution in nonlinear simulations more effectively, thereby allowing the
linear covariance controller to perform more as intended in nonlinear
environments.

Abstract: Wilson-Cowan and Amari-type models capture nonlinear neural population
dynamics, providing a fundamental framework for modeling how sensory and other
exogenous inputs shape activity in neural tissue. We study the controllability
properties of Amari-type neural fields subject to piecewise/constant-in-time
inputs. The model describes the time evolution of the polarization of neural
tissue within a spatial continuum, with synaptic interactions represented by a
convolution kernel. We study the synthesis of piecewise/constant-in-time inputs
to achieve two-point boundary-type control objectives, namely, steering neural
activity from an initial state to a prescribed target state. This approach is
particularly relevant for predicting the emergence of paradoxical neural
representations, such as discordant visual illusions that occur in response to
overt sensory stimuli. We first present a control synthesis based on the Banach
fixed-point theorem, which yields an iterative construction of a
constant-in-time input under minimal regularity assumptions on the kernel and
transfer function; however, it exhibits practical limitations, even in the
linear case. To overcome these challenges, we then develop a generic synthesis
framework based on the flow of neural dynamics drift, enabling explicit
piecewise constant and constant-in-time inputs. Extensive numerical results in
one and two spatial dimensions confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
syntheses and demonstrate their superior performance compared to inputs derived
from naive linearization at the initial or target states when these states are
not equilibria of the drift dynamics. By providing a mathematically rigorous
framework for controlling Amari-type neural fields, this work advances our
understanding of nonlinear neural population control with potential
applications in computational neuroscience, psychophysics, and
neurostimulation.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种处理流形约束极小极大问题的单循环平滑流形梯度下降-上升算法(sm-MGDA)，无需回缩操作，能够高效求解非凸流形约束下的极小极大优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决流形约束下的极小极大优化问题，传统方法需要计算回缩操作，这在GPU上效率低下。本文旨在开发无需回缩的算法，提高实际应用中的计算效率。

Method: 使用精确惩罚方法处理流形约束，将其转化为凸约束问题，提出单循环平滑流形梯度下降-上升算法(sm-MGDA)。对于μ=0的情况，采用Tikhonov正则化改进复杂度。

Result: sm-MGDA能够生成原始问题的O(ϵ)-稳定点，复杂度为O(1/ϵ²)(μ>0)和Õ(1/ϵ⁴)(μ=0)。通过Tikhonov正则化可将μ=0情况的复杂度改进为O(1/ϵ³)。

Conclusion: sm-MGDA是第一个无需回缩的流形极小极大问题算法，避免了矩阵正交化操作，具有更好的GPU友好性，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the minimax problem $\min_{x\in M} \max_y f_r(x,y):=f(x,y)-h(y)$,
where $M$ is a compact submanifold, $f$ is continuously differentiable in $(x,
y)$, $h$ is a closed, weakly-convex (possibly non-smooth) function and we
assume that the regularized coupling function $-f_r(x,\cdot)$ is either
$\mu$-PL for some $\mu>0$ or concave ($\mu = 0$) for any fixed $x$ in the
vicinity of $M$. To address the nonconvexity due to the manifold constraint, we
use an exact penalty for the constraint $x \in M$, and enforcing a convex
constraint $x\in X$ for some $X \supset M$, onto which projections can be
computed efficiently. Building upon this new formulation for the manifold
minimax problem in question, a single-loop smoothed manifold gradient
descent-ascent (sm-MGDA) algorithm is proposed. Theoretically, any limit point
of sm-MGDA sequence is a stationary point of the manifold minimax problem and
sm-MGDA can generate an $O(\epsilon)$-stationary point of the original problem
with $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ and $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ complexity for $\mu > 0$
and $\mu = 0$ scenarios, respectively. Moreover, for the $\mu = 0$ setting,
through adopting Tikhonov regularization of the dual, one can improve the
complexity to $O(1/\epsilon^3)$ at the expense of asymptotic stationarity. The
key component, common in the analysis of all cases, is to connect
$\epsilon$-stationary points between the penalized problem and the original
problem by showing that the constraint $x \in X$ becomes inactive and the
penalty term tends to $0$ along any convergent subsequence. To our knowledge,
sm-MGDA is the first retraction-free algorithm for minimax problems over
compact submanifolds, and this is a very desirable algorithmic property since
through avoiding retractions, one can get away with matrix orthogonalization
subroutines required for computing retractions to manifolds arising in

*Alina Ene,Ta Duy Nguyen,Adrian Vladu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信赖域方法的算法，用于求解带线性约束的准自协和函数优化问题，通过解决过定ℓ∞回归问题实现了比现有方法更高效的线性系统求解次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Adil-Bullins-Sachdeva (NeurIPS 2021)需要O(n^{1/3})次线性系统求解，对于大规模问题效率较低。本文旨在开发更高效的算法，将复杂度降低到O(d^{1/3})次线性系统求解。

Method: 采用信赖域方法结合oracle，通过解决过定ℓ∞回归问题min_{x∈ℝ^d,Nx=v}∥Ax-b∥∞来实现oracle。使用ℓ∞ Lewis权重过估计和轻量级IRLS方法，在O((d^{1/3}/ε+1/ε²)log(n/ε))次线性系统求解内找到(1+ε)-近似解。

Result: 算法实现了O(d^{1/3})次线性系统求解的oracle复杂度，显著优于现有的O(n^{1/3})方法。实验表明，该算法大幅提升了标准CVX求解器的运行时间。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法在准自协和函数优化问题上实现了更高效的求解，通过创新的ℓ∞回归求解方法显著降低了计算复杂度，为大规模优化问题提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem $\min_{x\in
\mathbb{R}^{d},Nx=v}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f((Ax-b)_{i})$ for a quasi-self-concordant
function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, where $A,N$ are $n\times d$ and $m\times
d$ matrices, $b,v$ are vectors of length $n$ and $m$ with $n\ge d.$ We show an
algorithm based on a trust-region method with an oracle that can be implemented
using $\widetilde{O}(d^{1/3})$ linear system solves, improving the
$\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ oracle by {[}Adil-Bullins-Sachdeva, NeurIPS 2021{]}.
Our implementation of the oracle relies on solving the overdetermined
$\ell_{\infty}$-regression problem
$\min_{x\in\mathbb{R}^{d},Nx=v}\|Ax-b\|_{\infty}$. We provide an algorithm that
finds a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution to this problem using
$O((d^{1/3}/\epsilon+1/\epsilon^{2})\log(n/\epsilon))$ linear system solves.
This algorithm leverages $\ell_{\infty}$ Lewis weight overestimates and
achieves this iteration complexity via a simple lightweight IRLS approach,
inspired by the work of {[}Ene-Vladu, ICML 2019{]}. Experimentally, we
demonstrate that our algorithm significantly improves the runtime of the
standard CVX solver.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将经典行为系统理论的核心结果从线性时不变系统扩展到仿射时不变系统，研究两者之间的结构相似性。

Method: 通过核表示、输入输出表示、状态空间表示和有限时域数据驱动表示来表征仿射时不变系统的行为，并引入针对该模型类的新持续激励条件。

Result: 提出了新的基本引理，与线性系统的经典结果平行，同时可证明地减少了数据需求。

Conclusion: 激励条件必须适应模型类：忽视结构差异可能导致不必要保守的数据需求。

Abstract: The paper extends core results of behavioral systems theory from linear to
affine time-invariant systems. We characterize the behavior of affine
time-invariant systems via kernel, input-output, state-space, and
finite-horizon data-driven representations, demonstrating a range of structural
parallels with linear time-invariant systems. Building on these
representations, we introduce a new persistence of excitation condition
tailored to the model class of affine time-invariant systems. The condition
yields a new fundamental lemma that parallels the classical result for linear
systems while provably reducing data requirements. Our analysis highlights that
excitation conditions must be adapted to the model class: overlooking
structural differences may lead to unnecessarily conservative data
requirements.

Abstract: This paper introduces new parameter-free first-order methods for convex
optimization problems in which the objective function exhibits H\"{o}lder
smoothness. Inspired by the recently proposed distance-over-gradient (DOG)
technique, we propose an accelerated distance-adaptive method which achieves
optimal anytime convergence rates for H\"{o}lder smooth problems without
requiring prior knowledge of smoothness parameters or explicit parameter
tuning. Importantly, our parameter-free approach removes the necessity of
specifying target accuracy in advance, addressing a limitation found in the
universal fast gradient methods (Nesterov, Yu. \textit{Mathematical
Programming}, 2015). For convex stochastic optimization, we further present a
parameter-free accelerated method that eliminates the need for line-search
procedures. Preliminary experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach on convex nonsmooth problems and its advantages over existing
parameter-free or accelerated methods.

Method: 扩展了近端增广拉格朗日(PAL⁺)策略，结合镜像下降思想设计连续时间平滑优化动力学，处理一般凸等式-不等式约束，实现原始-对偶变量的强凸-凹性。

Result: 实现了算法的指数收敛，扩展了现有仅考虑无约束或仿射线性约束的指数收敛结果，改进了凸约束下依赖复杂梯度投影方案的渐近收敛。

Conclusion: 所提出的无投影原始-对偶动力学方法在处理非光滑复合优化问题时具有更好的收敛性能和数值效率，为约束优化问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a projection-free primal-dual dynamics for the nonsmooth
composite optimization problems with equality and inequality constraints. To
deal with optimization constraints, this paper departs from the use of gradient
projection method, but resorts to the idea of mirror descent to design a
continuous-time smooth optimization dynamics which advantageously leads to
easier convergence analysis and more efficient numerical simulation. Also, the
strategy of proximal augmented Lagrangian (PAL$^{\dag}$) is extended to
incorporate general convex equality-inequality constraints and the strong
convexity-concavity of the primal-dual variables is achieved, ensuring
exponential convergence of the resulting algorithm. Furthermore, the
convergence result in this paper extends existing exponential convergence which
either takes no account of constraints or considers only affine linear
constraints, and it also enhances existing asymptotic convergence under convex
constraints which unfortunately depends on the complex gradient projection
scheme.

Result: 证明了前向后向半包络在约束流形邻域内是局部Lipschitz光滑的，且与原问题具有相同的一阶稳定点，数值实验验证了方法的实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 前向后向半包络方法为非线性约束优化问题提供了有效的求解框架，能够在约束流形上直接应用优化算法并保持收敛性质，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonlinear constrained optimization problem
(NCP) with constraint set $\{x \in \mathcal{X}: c(x) = 0\}$, where
$\mathcal{X}$ is a closed convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Building upon the
forward-backward envelope framework for optimization over $\mathcal{X}$, we
propose a forward-backward semi-envelope (FBSE) approach for solving (NCP). In
the proposed semi-envelope approach, we eliminate the constraint $x \in
\mathcal{X}$ through a specifically designed envelope scheme while preserving
the constraint $x \in \mathcal{M} := \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: c(x) = 0\}$. We
establish that the forward-backward semi-envelope for (NCP) is well-defined and
locally Lipschitz smooth over a neighborhood of $\mathcal{M}$. Furthermore, we
prove that (NCP) and its corresponding forward-backward semi-envelope have the
same first-order stationary points within a neighborhood of $\mathcal{X} \cap
\mathcal{M}$. Consequently, our proposed forward-backward semi-envelope
approach enables direct application of optimization methods over $\mathcal{M}$
while inheriting their convergence properties for (NCP). Additionally, we
develop an inexact projected gradient descent method for minimizing the
forward-backward semi-envelope over $\mathcal{M}$ and establish its global
convergence. Preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate the practical
efficiency and potential of our proposed approach.

Motivation: 扩展传统优化方法，处理具有非二次正则项的非凸优化问题，特别是当函数满足p-抛物凹性而非传统Lipschitz或Hölder梯度连续性时。

Method: 使用高阶majorant构建一阶majorization-minimization框架，开发HiFBA算法及其Boosted HiFBA加速版本，引入高阶前向后向包络作为Lyapunov函数进行收敛分析。

Result: 证明了算法在适当不精确条件下的子序列收敛性，在KL不等式下获得全局线性收敛率。初步实验在线性逆问题和正则化非负矩阵分解中显示了算法效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架和算法为求解具有挑战性的非凸优化问题提供了有效工具，特别是在处理非二次正则化和p-抛物凹函数时表现出良好性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a first-order majorization-minimization framework based
on a high-order majorant for continuous functions, incorporating a
non-quadratic regularization term of degree $p>1$. Notably, it is shown to be
valid if and only if the function is $p$-paraconcave, thus extending beyond
Lipschitz and H\"{o}lder gradient continuity for $p \in (1,2]$, and implying
concavity for $p>2$. In the smooth setting, this majorant recovers a variant of
the classical descent lemma with quadratic regularization. Building on this
foundation, we develop a high-order inexact forward-backward algorithm (HiFBA)
and its line-search-accelerated variant, named Boosted HiFBA. For convergence
analysis, we introduce a high-order forward-backward envelope (HiFBE), which
serves as a Lyapunov function. We establish subsequential convergence under
suitable inexactness conditions, and we prove global convergence with linear
rates for functions satisfying the Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz inequality. Our
preliminary experiments on linear inverse problems and regularized nonnegative
matrix factorization highlight the efficiency of HiFBA and its boosted variant,
demonstrating their potential for solving challenging nonconvex optimization
problems.

Conclusion: 所提出的演员-评论家算法能够有效处理具有风险约束的线性二次调节问题，为安全关键控制应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the infinite-horizon risk-constrained linear
quadratic regulator problem (RC-QR), which augments the classical LQR
formulation with a statistical constraint on the variability of the system
state to incorporate risk awareness, a key requirement in safety-critical
control applications. We propose an actor-critic learning algorithm that
jointly performs policy evaluation and policy improvement in a model-free and
online manner. The RC-QR problem is first reformulated as a max-min
optimization problem, from which we develop a multi-time-scale stochastic
approximation scheme. The critic employs temporal-difference learning to
estimate the action-value function, the actor updates the policy parameters via
a policy gradient step, and the dual variable is adapted through gradient
ascent to enforce the risk constraint.

Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the distributed stochastic optimization
problems on compact embedded submanifolds (in the Euclidean space) for
multi-agent network systems. To address the manifold structure, we propose a
distributed Riemannian stochastic proximal algorithm framework by utilizing the
retraction and Riemannian consensus protocol, and analyze three specific
algorithms: the distributed Riemannian stochastic subgradient, proximal point,
and prox-linear algorithms. When the local costs are weakly-convex and the
initial points satisfy certain conditions, we show that the iterates generated
by this framework converge to a nearly stationary point in expectation while
achieving consensus. We further establish the convergence rate of the algorithm
framework as $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1+\kappa_g}{\sqrt{k}})$ where $k$ denotes the
number of iterations and $\kappa_g$ shows the impact of manifold geometry on
the algorithm performance. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to
demonstrate the theoretical results and show the empirical performance.

Motivation: 解决二阶牛顿算法在大规模非凸问题中的三个主要挑战：Hessian计算成本高、求逆困难、在Hessian不定时确保下降方向。

Method: 提出新的搜索方向，仅在特定迭代中需要Hessian计算和求逆。通过正定矩阵近似Hessian，证明近似与精确Hessian的差异在区间内有界，在区间内重用近似Hessian。

Conclusion: INTHOP算法有效解决了二阶方法在大规模非凸优化中的计算效率问题，在保证收敛性的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Second-order Newton-type algorithms that leverage the exact Hessian or its
approximation are central to solving nonlinear optimization problems. These
algorithms have been proven to achieve a faster convergence rate than the
first-order methods and can find second-order stationary points. However, their
applications in solving large-scale nonconvex problems are hindered by three
primary challenges: (1) the high computational cost associated with Hessian
evaluations, (2) its inversion, and (3) ensuring descent direction at points
where the Hessian becomes indefinite. We propose INTHOP, an interval
Hessian-based optimization algorithm for nonconvex problems. Specifically, we
propose a new search direction guaranteed to be descent and requiring Hessian
evaluations and inversion only at specific iterations. The proposed search
direction is based on approximating the original Hessian matrix by a
positive-definite matrix. We prove that the difference between the approximate
and exact Hessian is bounded within an interval. Accordingly, the approximate
Hessian matrix is reused if the iterates are in the interval while computing
the gradients at each iteration. We develop various algorithm variants based on
the interval size updating methods and minimum eigenvalue computation methods.
We apply the algorithm to an extensive set of test problems and compare its
performance with steepest descent, quasi-Newton, and the Newton methods. We
show empirically that our method solves more problems in fewer function and
gradient evaluations than steepest descent and the quasi-Newton method.
Compared to the Newton method, we illustrate that for nonconvex problems, we
require substantially less O(n3) operations.

Motivation: 传统外梯度方法分析通常假设强L-Lipschitz条件，但在现代机器学习问题中，这种假设过于严格。本文旨在在更宽松的α-对称(L₀,L₁)-Lipschitz条件下研究EG方法的收敛性，该条件允许Lipschitz常数随算子范数缩放，能更好地刻画现代机器学习问题的结构特征。

Abstract: Introduced by Korpelevich in 1976, the extragradient method (EG) has become a
cornerstone technique for solving min-max optimization, root-finding problems,
and variational inequalities (VIs). Despite its longstanding presence and
significant attention within the optimization community, most works focusing on
understanding its convergence guarantees assume the strong L-Lipschitz
condition. In this work, building on the proposed assumptions by Zhang et al.
[2024b] for minimization and Vankov et al.[2024] for VIs, we focus on the more
relaxed $\alpha$-symmetric $(L_0, L_1)$-Lipschitz condition. This condition
generalizes the standard Lipschitz assumption by allowing the Lipschitz
constant to scale with the operator norm, providing a more refined
characterization of problem structures in modern machine learning. Under the
$\alpha$-symmetric $(L_0, L_1)$-Lipschitz condition, we propose a novel step
size strategy for EG to solve root-finding problems and establish sublinear
convergence rates for monotone operators and linear convergence rates for
strongly monotone operators. Additionally, we prove local convergence
guarantees for weak Minty operators. We supplement our analysis with
experiments validating our theory and demonstrating the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed step sizes for EG.

Motivation: 解决在只有零阶信息可用且目标函数存在随机采样噪声的情况下，非线性优化问题的求解挑战，特别是在缺乏导数信息时如何有效处理随机近似带来的偏差问题。

Result: 在标准假设下建立了DF-SSQP方法的全局几乎必然收敛性，并证明了重标度迭代具有渐近正态性，其极限协方差矩阵类似于基于导数方法达到的极小极大最优协方差。

Conclusion: DF-SSQP方法在缺乏导数信息的情况下仍能实现全局收敛和局部收敛保证，数值实验验证了其全局和局部行为，支持在线统计推断。

Abstract: We consider solving nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic
objective and deterministic equality constraints, assuming that only zero-order
information is available for both the objective and constraints, and that the
objective is also subject to random sampling noise. Under this setting, we
propose a Derivative-Free Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (DF-SSQP)
method. Due to the lack of derivative information, we adopt a simultaneous
perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) technique to randomly estimate the
gradients and Hessians of both the objective and constraints. This approach
requires only a dimension-independent number of zero-order evaluations -- as
few as eight -- at each iteration step. A key distinction between our
derivative-free and existing derivative-based SSQP methods lies in the
intricate random bias introduced into the gradient and Hessian estimates of the
objective and constraints, brought by stochastic zero-order approximations. To
address this issue, we introduce an online debiasing technique based on
momentum-style estimators that properly aggregate past gradient and Hessian
estimates to reduce stochastic noise, while avoiding excessive memory costs via
a moving averaging scheme. Under standard assumptions, we establish the global
almost-sure convergence of the proposed DF-SSQP method. Notably, we further
complement the global analysis with local convergence guarantees by
demonstrating that the rescaled iterates exhibit asymptotic normality, with a
limiting covariance matrix resembling the minimax optimal covariance achieved
by derivative-based methods, albeit larger due to the absence of derivative
information. Our local analysis enables online statistical inference of model
parameters leveraging DF-SSQP. Numerical experiments on benchmark nonlinear
problems demonstrate both the global and local behavior of DF-SSQP.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to formulating the actor-critic method
for optimal control by casting policy iteration in reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (RKHSs -- also known as native spaces). By tailoring the reproducing
kernel and RKHS to the dynamics of the nonlinear optimal control problem, we
leverage recent advancements in characterizing error bounds from statistical
and machine learning theory. These approximations define a general strategy to
select the bases of the actor-critic networks, and we formally guarantee for
the first time that this basis selection procedure leads to closed-form error
bounds for the individual steps of policy iteration. These bounds often have a
geometric and computable form, making them potentially useful for a priori or a
posteriori evaluation of candidate collections of scattered bases. Numerical
studies subsequently provide qualitative evidence of the practical performance
achieved for the full recursion using the algorithms and theory developed for
the single-step error bounds.

Abstract: We consider a novel approach for the enhancement of fluid mixing via pure
stirring strategies building upon the Least Action Principle (LAP) for
incompressible flows. The LAP is formally analogous to the Benamou--Brenier
formulation of optimal transport, but imposes an incompressibility constraint.
Our objective is to find a velocity field, generated by Hamiltonian flows, that
minimizes the kinetic energy while ensuring that the initial scalar
distribution reaches a prescribed degree of mixedness by a finite time. This
formulation leads to a ``point to set" type of optimization problem which
relaxes the requirement on controllability of the system compared to the
classic LAP framework. In particular, we assume that the velocity field is
induced by a finite set of cellular flows that can be controlled in time. We
justify the feasibility of this constraint set and leverage Benamou--Brenier's
results to establish the existence of a global optimal solution. Finally, we
derive the corresponding optimality conditions for solving the optimal time
control and conduct numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of
our control design.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文研究了热方程爆破点的反馈近似可控性问题，证明了系统在爆破点处具有反馈近似可控性，且反馈算子在爆破前有界，同时爆破轮廓对初始数据具有稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究热方程爆破点的反馈控制问题，探索在爆破发生前通过反馈控制实现系统近似可控的可能性，并分析控制策略的抗干扰性能。

Method: 采用反馈控制方法，分析热方程在爆破点附近的行为特性，研究反馈算子的有界性和爆破轮廓的稳定性。

Result: 证明了系统在爆破点处具有反馈近似可控性，反馈算子在爆破前有界，且爆破轮廓对初始数据扰动具有稳定性——微小扰动仅导致时空上的微小平移。

Conclusion: 所提出的反馈控制策略能够有效实现热方程爆破点的近似可控，并且具有良好的抗干扰性能，为处理爆破现象的控制问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: This paper is concerned with a feedback approximate controllability problem
of blowup points for the heat equation. We show that the system is
approximately controllable for blowup points with feedback controls and the
feedback operator is bounded at any time before blowup. It is also proved that
the blowup profile for feedback controllability of blowup points is stable with
respect to initial data. That is, suppose that the initial data has a very
small perturbation, the blowup profiles also have tiny changes. More precisely,
it just undergoes a tiny translation in space and time. This means that our
feedback strategy is anti-interference.

TL;DR: 提出一种电解槽在多时间尺度电力市场中的动态运营策略，通过协调日前市场和实时市场参与来大幅降低绿氢生产的净电力成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电解制氢主要依赖单一时间尺度的日前市场购电，未能充分利用多尺度电力市场的经济优势，错失了降低整体成本的机会。

Method: 采用滚动时域优化框架协调投标和运营，电解槽通过日前市场购买主要能源，然后在实时市场中低价购买补充能源或在价格高时售出日前市场能源获利。

Result: 该策略能显著降低净电力支出，在现实市场情景下实现接近零甚至负的有效电力成本，意味着运营可以从电力市场互动中获利。

Conclusion: 通过将电解槽从单纯的价格接受者转变为能够在市场时间尺度间套利的积极参与者，为绿氢提供了财务上可行的路径，同时增强了电网灵活性。

Abstract: Green hydrogen production via electrolysis is crucial for decarbonization but
faces significant economic hurdles primarily due to the high cost of the
electricity. However, current electrolyzer-based hydrogen production processes
predominantly rely on the single-scale Day-Ahead Market (DAM) for electricity
procurement, failing to fully exploit the economic benefits offered by
multi-scale electricity market that integrates both the DAM and the Real-Time
Market (RTM), thereby eliminating the opportunity to reduce the overall cost.
To mitigate this technical gap, this research investigates a dynamic
operational strategy enabling electrolyzers to strategically navigate between
the DAM and RTM to minimize net operation costs. Using a rolling horizon
optimization framework to coordinate bidding and operation, we demonstrate a
strategy where electrolyzers secure primary energy via exclusive DAM purchases,
then actively engage the RTM to buy supplemental energy cheaply or, critically,
sell procured DAM energy back at a profit during high RTM price periods. Our
analysis reveals that this coordinated multi-scale electricity market
participation strategy can dramatically reduce net electricity expenditures,
achieving near-zero or even negative effective electricity costs for green
hydrogen production under realistic market scenarios, effectively meaning the
operation can profit from its electricity market interactions. By transforming
electrolyzers from simple price-takers into active participants capable of
arbitrage between market timescales, this approach unlocks a financially
compelling pathway for green hydrogen, accelerating its deployment while
simultaneously enhancing power grid flexibility.

Motivation: 无约束二进制整数规划由于离散性质存在显著计算挑战，传统方法在求解效率和精度方面存在局限，需要开发新的连续化方法。

Method: 使用分段三次函数将二进制约束转化为连续等式约束，建立精确罚函数框架，引入P-稳定点概念，开发APPA算法保证在有限迭代内收敛到P-稳定点。

Result: 数值实验表明APPA算法在精度和效率上优于现有求解器，能够处理多样化问题实例。

Conclusion: 该方法通过连续化转换和精确罚函数框架，有效解决了二进制整数规划问题，APPA算法具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Unconstrained binary integer programming (UBIP) poses significant
computational challenges due to its discrete nature. We introduce a novel
reformulation approach using a piecewise cubic function that transforms binary
constraints into continuous equality constraints. Instead of solving the
resulting constrained problem directly, we develop an exact penalty framework
with a key theoretical advantage: the penalty parameter threshold ensuring
exact equivalence is independent of the unknown solution set, unlike classical
exact penalty theory. To facilitate the analysis of the penalty model, we
introduce the concept of P-stationary points and systematically characterize
their optimality properties and relationships with local and global minimizers.
The P-stationary point enables the development of an efficient algorithm called
APPA, which is guaranteed to converge to a P-stationary point within a finite
number of iterations under a single mild assumption, namely, strong smoothness
of the objective function over the unit box. Comprehensive numerical
experiments demonstrate that APPA outperforms established solvers in both
accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem instances.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复合正则化问题，通过解耦算法显著提升了信号重建的时效性。

Abstract: We consider composite linear inverse problems where the signal to recover is
modeled as a sum of two functions. We study a variational framework formulated
as an optimization problem over the pairs of components using two
regularization terms, each of them acting on a different part of the solution.
The specificity of our work is to study the case where one component is
regularized with an atomic norm over a Banach space, which is known to promote
sparse reconstruction, while the other is regularized with a quadratic norm
over a Hilbert space, which promotes smooth solution.
  We show how this composite optimization problem can be reduced to an
optimization problem over the Banach space component only up to a linear
problem. This reveals a decoupling between the two components, allowing for a
new composite representer theorem. It naturally induces a decoupled numerical
procedure to solve the composite optimization problem.
  We exemplify our main result with a composite deconvolution problem of Dirac
recovery over a smooth background. In this setting, we illustrate the relevance
of a composite model and show a significant temporal gain on signal
reconstruction, which results from our decoupled algorithmic approach.

Conclusion: 分布LQR中的截断随机回报具有明确的数学结构特性，为分析随机回报的分布性质提供了理论基础，扩展了分布强化学习在控制理论中的应用。

Abstract: Distributional linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is a new framework that
integrates the distributional reinforcement learning and classical LQR, which
offers a new way to study the random return instead of the expected cost.
Unlike iterative approximation using dynamic programming in the DRL, a
closed-form expression for the random return can be exactly characterized in
the distributional LQR, which is defined over infinitely many random variables.
In recent work [1, 2], it has been shown that this random return can be well
approximated by a finite number of random variables, which we call truncated
random return. In this paper, we study the truncated random return in the
distributional LQR. We show that the truncated random return can be naturally
expressed in the quadratic form. We develop a sufficient condition for the
positive definiteness of the block symmetric matrix in the quadratic form and
provide the lower and upper bounds on the eigenvalues of this matrix. We
further show that in this case, the truncated random return follows a
positively weighted non-central chi-square distribution if the random
disturbances admits Gaussian, and its cumulative distribution function is
log-concave if the probability density function of the random disturbances is
log-concave.

Motivation: 研究具有近似可分离结构的MDP，旨在为这类问题提供有效的解决方案，并分析在结构扰动下的性能保证。

Method: 首先推导完全可分离情况下的显式平稳决策规则，然后分析在ε扰动下该策略的性能损失。

Result: 在完全可分离情况下获得了精确的平均最优策略，在ε扰动下该策略的平均奖励损失为O(ε)量级。

Abstract: We study a class of infinite-horizon average-cost Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) whose reward and transition structures are nearly separable. For the
totally separable baseline (that is, with no perturbation), we derive an
explicit stationary decision rule that is exactly average-optimal. We then show
that under an epsilon-perturbation of the separable structure, this policy
remains epsilon-optimal, meaning that the loss in the average reward is of
order O(epsilon).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着配电网中柔性能源设备增加，TSO和DSO之间的协调变得至关重要。传统FOR计算方法假设只有一个互联点，这在实践中往往不成立。

Method: 采用分层方式解决整体系统运行问题，计算TSO/DSO互联的可行运行区域，特别针对多互联点场景。

Result: 在具有两个互联点的电网中测试了该方法，并从电力系统角度分析了生成的高维FOR特性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理多互联点场景，为TSO和DSO之间的协调运行提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing number of flexible energy devices in distribution grids,
coordination between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution
System Operators (DSOs) becomes critical for optimal system operation. One form
of coordination is to solve the overall system operation problem in a
hierarchical way, computing Feasible Operational Regions (FORs) for the
interconnection between TSO/DSO. Most methods for computing FORs rely on the
assumption of only one interconnection point between TSO and DSOs, which is
often violated in practice. In this work, we propose a method for computing
FORs in distribution grids with multiple interconnection points to the
transmission grid. We test our method in a grid with two interconnecting points
and analyze the properties of the resulting high-dimensional FOR from a power
systems perspective.

Result: 开发了一个在管制空间中运行的顺序规划框架，与现有时隙分配系统完全兼容

Conclusion: RegulationZero为解决管制级联问题提供了有效的优化方法

Abstract: Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) traffic regulations are being increasingly
used as rising demand meets persistent workforce shortages. This operational
strain has amplified a critical phenomenon that we call \emph{regulation
cascading}: the compounding, non-linear interactions that occur when multiple
regulations influence one another in unpredictable ways. As the number and
complexity of regulations grow, cascading effects become more pronounced,
undermining the network operator's ability to protect sectors reliably. To
address this challenge, we introduce RegulationZero, a sequential planning
framework that natively operates in the regulation space, optimizing over
ordered sequences of flow-level regulations that remain fully compatible with
existing slot-allocation systems such as CASA and RBS++. At its core, the
method employs a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that first samples
congestion hotspots and then selects candidate regulations synthesized by a
local proposal engine. Each proposal is evaluated by a fast
First-Planned-First-Served (FPFS) allocator to estimate its reward, with these
feedbacks guiding the subsequent MCTS exploration.

Abstract: The purpose of this work is to investigate root finding problems defined on
(quasi-)metric spaces, and ranging in Euclidean spaces. The motivation for this
line of inquiry stems from recent models in biology and phylogenetics, where
problems of great practical significance are cast as optimization problems on
(quasi-)metric spaces. We investigate a minimal algebraic setup that allows us
to study a notion of differentiability suitable for Newton-type methods, called
Newton differentiability. This notion of differentiability benefits from
calculus rules and is sufficient to prove superlinear convergence of a
Newton-type method. Finally, a Newton-Kantorovich-type theorem provides an
inverse function result, applicable on (quasi-)metric spaces.

Conclusion: 成功构建了一个既实现高效决策又保证闭环稳定性的MOMPC框架，为多目标控制问题提供了理论严谨且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective model predictive control (MOMPC) for fixed point
stabilization requires an automated a priori decision-making mechanism to
translate a high-level preference into a single solution to be implemented. To
this aim, we introduce an approach called individual minima-informed
decision-making. This class of methods can be implemented through two
sequential optimizations, regardless of the number of objectives, thereby
improving the real-time capability of MOMPC. These methods operate on Pareto
fronts and leverage the individual minima (IM), which are characteristic
Pareto-optimal points. By this, we aim to produce a robust translation of a
high-level preference to a suitable point on the Pareto front. However,
guaranteeing the closed-loop stability of the resulting MOMPC scheme remains an
open challenge.
  This paper addresses this gap by developing a novel MOMPC framework that
integrates IM-informed decision-making while formally guaranteeing asymptotic
stability. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose and systematically
analyze six variants of IM-informed decision-making methods -- including two
novel methods -- designed to achieve the above-mentioned translation. Second,
we embed these methods into a quasi-infinite horizon MOMPC framework and
provide a rigorous proof of closed-loop asymptotic stability. The proof holds
for any of the presented decision-making methods and relies on a descent
condition that is less restrictive than those in prior literature. The
practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed framework are
demonstrated in a numerical case study.

Motivation: 研究智能体在共享状态信息并合作时的随机控制问题，特别关注控制之间成对交互的耦合成本项，旨在量化信息共享对系统性能的影响。

Method: 引入仅观察自身状态的对比问题，将两个问题重新表述为Hamilton-Jacobi型方程，通过比较相关Hamiltonian来建立价值函数差异的定量界限，主要难点在于精确比较最优控制的分布。

Result: 建立了共享状态信息与仅观察自身状态两种问题之间价值函数的定量界限，为理解信息共享对大规模随机控制系统性能的影响提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 通过Hamilton-Jacobi方程框架成功量化了信息共享在大规模随机控制问题中的影响，为相关多智能体系统的分析与设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates large-population stochastic control problems in which
agents share their state information and cooperate to minimize a convex cost
functional. The latter is decomposed into individual and coupling costs, with
the distinctive feature that the coupling term is a pairwise interaction
function between the controls. To address this setting, we follow closely
(Jackson & Lacker, 2025): we introduce a related problem where each agent
observes only its own state. We then establish a quantitative bound on the
difference between the value functions associated with these two problems. We
obtain this result by reformulating the problems analytically as
Hamilton-Jacobi type equations and comparing their associated Hamiltonians. The
main difficulty of our approach lies in establishing a precise comparison
between the distributions of the corresponding optimal controls.

Motivation: 由于计算能力的提升，需要重新评估区域模型作为节点容量扩展规划现实有用近似的假设，因为传统上由于计算限制只能使用低空间分辨率的区域模型。

Method: 使用基于加州现实的大规模测试网络（超过8000个母线和10000条输电线路），系统比较不同空间聚合程度对容量扩展规划结果的影响。

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的小型空间聚合能够产生良好的近似结果，但较粗的区域模型会导致投资决策出现严重失真。

Conclusion: 虽然计算限制正在减弱，但空间聚合在容量扩展规划中的使用需要谨慎，精细的空间聚合可行，但粗粒度区域模型不可靠。

Abstract: Solving power system capacity expansion planning (CEP) problems at realistic
spatial resolutions is computationally challenging. Thus, a common practice is
to solve CEP over zonal models with low spatial resolution rather than over
full-scale nodal power networks. Due to improvements in solving large-scale
stochastic mixed integer programs, these computational limitations are becoming
less relevant, and the assumption that zonal models are realistic and useful
approximations of nodal CEP is worth revisiting. This work is the first to
conduct a systematic computational study on the assumption that spatial
aggregation can reasonably be used for ISO- and interconnect-scale CEP. By
considering a realistic, large-scale test network based on the state of
California with over 8,000 buses and 10,000 transmission lines, we demonstrate
that well-designed small spatial aggregations can yield good approximations but
that coarser zonal models result in large distortions of investment decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态结构模型中序列相关潜变量的分布假设对参数估计至关重要，需要量化这些假设对关键参数（如福利、弹性）的影响程度。

Method: 通过扰动参考分布并施加平稳性或马尔可夫性条件，构建优化问题来获得参数边界，并推导出计算可行的对偶公式。

Result: 在汽车需求应用中，扰动价格弹性最多偏离15.24%，电动汽车补贴的消费者剩余估计变化高达102.75%；在劳动力供给应用中，Frisch劳动供给弹性工作日最多偏离76.83%，周末最多偏离42.84%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效量化动态结构模型参数对分布假设的敏感性，为模型稳健性评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Distributional assumptions that discipline serially correlated latent
variables play a central role in dynamic structural models. We propose a
framework to quantify the sensitivity of scalar parameters of interest (e.g.,
welfare, elasticity) to such distributional assumptions. We derive bounds on
the scalar parameter by perturbing a reference distribution, while imposing a
stationarity condition for time-homogeneous models or a Markovian condition for
time-inhomogeneous models. The bounds are the solutions to optimization
problems, for which we derive a computationally tractable dual formulation. We
establish consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic distribution for the
estimator of the bounds. We demonstrate the approach with two applications: an
infinite-horizon dynamic demand model for new cars in the United Kingdom,
Germany, and France, and a finite-horizon dynamic labor supply model for taxi
drivers in New York City. In the car application, perturbed price elasticities
deviate by at most 15.24% from the reference elasticities, while perturbed
estimates of consumer surplus from an additional $3,000 electric vehicle
subsidy vary by up to 102.75%. In the labor supply application, the perturbed
Frisch labor supply elasticity deviates by at most 76.83% for weekday drivers
and 42.84% for weekend drivers.

Motivation: 传统面板空间自回归模型需要预先指定空间联系结构，而本文方法无需任何先验结构假设，让数据自己说话，特别适用于N远大于T的情况。

Method: 开发了贝叶斯估计方法，通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证，能够快速估计空间权重矩阵和潜在共同因子。

Result: 蒙特卡洛研究表明该方法计算速度快，估计的空间权重矩阵和共同因子与真实值高度相似。在欧盟地区GVA增长率的实证应用中，发现了明显的国家层面集群，且只有小部分数据变异由与解释变量不相关的潜在冲击解释。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需先验结构假设的有效工具，能够准确捕捉面板数据中的空间依赖性和共同因子结构。

Abstract: We develop a new Bayesian approach to estimating panel spatial autoregressive
models with a known number of latent common factors, where N, the number of
cross-sectional units, is much larger than T, the number of time periods.
Without imposing any a priori structures on the spatial linkages between
variables, we let the data speak for themselves. Extensive Monte Carlo studies
show that our method is super-fast and our estimated spatial weights matrices
and common factors strongly resemble their true counterparts. As an
illustration, we examine the spatial interdependence of regional gross value
added (GVA) growth rates across the European Union (EU). In addition to
revealing the clear presence of predominant country-level clusters, our results
indicate that only a small portion of the variation in the data is explained by
the latent shocks that are uncorrelated with the explanatory variables.

Method: 利用现有的面板数据斜率同质性检验工具，在双重局部备择假设下分析检验框架的性能，其中斜率被分为主导组和剩余组。

Result: 蒙特卡洛研究证实了理论发现，展示了所提出方法在检验分组模式方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 现有斜率同质性检验工具可用于检验面板数据中的分组模式，但需要注意在特定条件下的局限性。

Abstract: While the literature on grouped patterns in panel data analysis has received
significant attention, little to no results are available on testing for their
presence. We propose using existing tools for testing slope homogeneity in
panels for this purpose. We highlight the key advantages and limitations of the
available testing frameworks under a sequence of doubly local alternatives,
where slopes are divided into dominant and remainder groups, with the size of
the remainder groups and the slopes differences shrinking at a certain rate as
the sample size increases. A Monte Carlo study corroborate our theoretical
findings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究双边互动模型中互补性的识别和估计问题，解决传统方法在稀疏网络中难以识别灵活互补性模式的问题。

Method: 引入Tukey模型及其两个扩展，提出基于循环的估计器，建立识别理论并开发互补性检验方法。

Result: Tukey模型在温和条件下可识别，其估计器在稀疏网络中仍具有一致性和渐近正态性，并能恢复有经济意义的互补性。

Conclusion: Tukey模型为双边互动中的互补性分析提供了实用框架，在稀疏网络条件下仍能有效识别和估计互补性参数。

Abstract: This paper studies a class of models for two-sided interactions, where
outcomes depend on latent characteristics of two distinct agent types. Models
in this class have two core elements: the matching network, which records which
agent pairs interact, and the interaction function, which maps latent
characteristics of these agents to outcomes and determines the role of
complementarities. I introduce the Tukey model, which captures
complementarities with a single interaction parameter, along with two
extensions that allow richer complementarity patterns. First, I establish an
identification trade-off between the flexibility of the interaction function
and the density of the matching network: the Tukey model is identified under
mild conditions, whereas the more flexible extensions require dense networks
that are rarely observed in applications. Second, I propose a cycle-based
estimator for the Tukey interaction parameter and show that it is consistent
and asymptotically normal even when the network is sparse. Third, I use its
asymptotic distribution to construct a formal test of no complementarities.
Finally, an empirical illustration shows that the Tukey model recovers
economically meaningful complementarities.

*Shovon Sengupta,Sunny Kumar Singh,Tanujit Chakraborty*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的Sims Zha贝叶斯VAR模型（SZBVARx），通过整合领域知识驱动的收缩方法和四种基于新闻的不确定性冲击，显著提升了G7国家宏观经济预测的准确性，在12和24个月预测期均优于14个基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAR模型在高维环境下容易过拟合，而阈值VAR难以处理时变依赖关系和复杂参数结构。在当今地缘政治动荡、政策反复和金融市场波动的背景下，精准的宏观经济预测变得愈发困难。

Method: 扩展Sims Zha贝叶斯VAR模型，整合领域知识驱动的收缩方法和四种基于新闻的不确定性冲击（经济政策不确定性、地缘政治风险、美国股市波动性、美国货币政策不确定性），结合小波相干分析和非线性局部投影方法。

Result: 在G7数据上的样本外预测结果显示，SZBVARx在12和24个月预测期均显著优于14个基准模型（包括传统VAR和领先的机器学习模型），并通过多种统计检验验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: SZBVARx为G7政策制定者提供了一个透明、校准良好的工具，能够在普遍不确定性环境下进行现代宏观经济预测，支持情景分析和风险管理。

Abstract: Accurate macroeconomic forecasting has become harder amid geopolitical
disruptions, policy reversals, and volatile financial markets. Conventional
vector autoregressions (VARs) overfit in high dimensional settings, while
threshold VARs struggle with time varying interdependencies and complex
parameter structures. We address these limitations by extending the Sims Zha
Bayesian VAR with exogenous variables (SZBVARx) to incorporate domain-informed
shrinkage and four newspaper based uncertainty shocks such as economic policy
uncertainty, geopolitical risk, US equity market volatility, and US monetary
policy uncertainty. The framework improves structural interpretability,
mitigates dimensionality, and imposes empirically guided regularization. Using
G7 data, we study spillovers from uncertainty shocks to five core variables
(unemployment, real broad effective exchange rates, short term rates, oil
prices, and CPI inflation), combining wavelet coherence (time frequency
dynamics) with nonlinear local projections (state dependent impulse responses).
Out-of-sample results at 12 and 24 month horizons show that SZBVARx outperforms
14 benchmarks, including classical VARs and leading machine learning models, as
confirmed by Murphy difference diagrams, multivariate Diebold Mariano tests,
and Giacomini White predictability tests. Credible Bayesian prediction
intervals deliver robust uncertainty quantification for scenario analysis and
risk management. The proposed SZBVARx offers G7 policymakers a transparent,
well calibrated tool for modern macroeconomic forecasting under pervasive
uncertainty.

*Aristotelis Epanomeritakis,Davide Viviano*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架，用于设计结合实验和观察证据的实验，以解决外部有效性和一般均衡效应等政策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验估计通常局限于特定情境，难以推广到更广泛的政策问题，需要结合观察证据来估计外部有效性和一般均衡效应。

Method: 开发了一个最小化比例遗憾目标的设计框架，研究者选择实验参数、分配样本量，并权衡实验和观察估计量，无需预先指定偏差界限。

Result: 该框架提供了透明的偏差-方差权衡，仅依赖于估计量精度和估计目标对基础参数的敏感性信息。

Conclusion: 通过现金转移实验和微金融干预的案例研究，展示了该框架在实际政策设计中的应用价值。

Abstract: Experiments deliver credible but often localized effects, tied to specific
sites, populations, or mechanisms. When such estimates are insufficient to
extrapolate effects for broader policy questions, such as external validity and
general-equilibrium (GE) effects, researchers combine trials with external
evidence from reduced-form or structural observational estimates, or prior
experiments. We develop a unified framework for designing experiments in this
setting: the researcher selects which parameters to identify experimentally
from a feasible set (which treatment arms and/or individuals to include in the
experiment), allocates sample size, and specifies how to weight experimental
and observational estimators. Because observational inputs may be biased in
ways unknown ex ante, we develop a minimax proportional regret objective that
evaluates any candidate design relative to an oracle that knows the bias and
jointly chooses the design and estimator. This yields a transparent
bias-variance trade-off that requires no prespecified bias bound and depends
only on information about the precision of the estimators and the estimand's
sensitivity to the underlying parameters. We illustrate the framework by (i)
designing small-scale cash transfer experiments aimed at estimating GE effects
and (ii) optimizing site selection for microfinance interventions.

*Masahiro Kato*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了一个直接去偏机器学习框架，结合Neyman目标估计和广义Riesz回归，统一了自动去偏机器学习、协变量平衡、目标最大似然估计和密度比估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在因果效应或结构模型中，参数估计依赖于回归函数，但使用机器学习方法估计的回归函数会因一阶段偏差而导致性能不佳。去偏机器学习通过Neyman正交估计方程来减少这种偏差。

Method: 开发了直接去偏机器学习框架，通过最小化已知和未知nuisance参数计算的Neyman正交得分之间的差异来估计回归函数和Riesz表示子，使用Bregman散度衡量差异。

Result: 该框架统一了多种方法：平方损失产生Riesz回归，KL散度产生熵平衡，特定情况下自动获得协变量平衡特性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为去偏机器学习提供了一个统一的视角，能够自动处理偏差问题并整合多种现有方法。

Abstract: We develop a direct debiased machine learning framework comprising Neyman
targeted estimation and generalized Riesz regression. Our framework unifies
Riesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning, covariate balancing,
targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and density-ratio estimation. In
many problems involving causal effects or structural models, the parameters of
interest depend on regression functions. Plugging regression functions
estimated by machine learning methods into the identifying equations can yield
poor performance because of first-stage bias. To reduce such bias, debiased
machine learning employs Neyman orthogonal estimating equations. Debiased
machine learning typically requires estimation of the Riesz representer and the
regression function. For this problem, we develop a direct debiased machine
learning framework with an end-to-end algorithm. We formulate estimation of the
nuisance parameters, the regression function and the Riesz representer, as
minimizing the discrepancy between Neyman orthogonal scores computed with known
and unknown nuisance parameters, which we refer to as Neyman targeted
estimation. Neyman targeted estimation includes Riesz representer estimation,
and we measure discrepancies using the Bregman divergence. The Bregman
divergence encompasses various loss functions as special cases, where the
squared loss yields Riesz regression and the Kullback-Leibler divergence yields
entropy balancing. We refer to this Riesz representer estimation as generalized
Riesz regression. Neyman targeted estimation also yields TMLE as a special case
for regression function estimation. Furthermore, for specific pairs of models
and Riesz representer estimation methods, we can automatically obtain the
covariate balancing property without explicitly solving the covariate balancing
objective.

Abstract: This paper discusses the different contemporaneous causal interpretations of
Panel Vector Autoregressions (PVAR). I show that the interpretation of PVARs
depends on the distribution of the causing variable, and can range from average
treatment effects, to average causal responses, to a combination of the two. If
the researcher is willing to postulate a no residual autocorrelation
assumption, and some units can be thought of as controls, PVAR can identify
average treatment effects on the treated. This method complements the toolkits
already present in the literature, such as staggered-DiD, or LP-DiD, as it
formulates assumptions in the residuals, and not in the outcome variables. Such
a method features a notable advantage: it allows units to be ``sparsely''
treated, capturing the impact of interventions on the innovation component of
the outcome variables. I provide an example related to the evaluation of the
effects of natural disasters economic activity at the weekly frequency in the
US.I conclude by discussing solutions to potential violations of the SUTVA
assumption arising from interference.
