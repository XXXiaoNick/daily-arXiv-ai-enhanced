Further, a case of mixed-autonomy is considered by controlling one car with Followerstopper in a ring road setting containing IDM vehicles as human drivers. Specifically, the stop-and-go waves phenomenon in idealized traffic from a dynamical systems perspective is examined. We show that Followerstopper-controlled vehicle is effective at eliminating emergent stop-and-go waves in the IDM traffic simulation. We show through simulation that the uniform flow manifold is unstable for the ring road simulation with IDM vehicles, and that replacing a single car with Followerstopper induces stability, allowing the cars to drive safely at a uniform speed. Additionally, the case of known delay is considered in a mixed-autonomy scenario. Our simulation result shows that while considering a known time delay, traffic waves emerge earlier than in the no-delay case. At the same time, a single-vehicle controlled using Followerstopper controller is able to prevent the emergence of traffic waves even in the presence of delay."}

Taurus is a long-duration balloon instrument designed for rapid azimuthal scanning at approximately 30 deg/s using a motorized pivot at the flight-train connection, without a reaction wheel. We model the gondola as a rigid body subject to realistic disturbances and sensing limitations, and implement a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) that estimates attitude and gyroscope bias by fusing inertial and vector-camera measurements. A simple PI controller uses the estimated states to regulate yaw rate. Numerical simulations incorporating representative disturbance and measurement noise levels are used to evaluate closed-loop control performance and MEKF behavior under flight-like conditions. Experimental tests on the Taurus gondola validate the pivot-only approach, demonstrating stable high-rate tracking under realistic hardware constraints. The close agreement between simulation and experiment indicates that the simplified rigid-body model captures the dominant dynamics relevant for controller design and integrated estimation-and-control development."}

To achieve this, we expand a safety or stability function with respect to time along the system dynamics using the Lie derivative and Taylor's theorem. This expansion enables the control input to appear in the Taylor series at an order equivalent to the relative degree of the function. We show that the proposed TLC provides necessary and sufficient conditions for system safety and is applicable to systems and constraints of arbitrary relative degree. The TLC exhibits connections with existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) and Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) methods, and it further extends the CBF and CLF methods to the complex domain, especially for higher order cases. Compared to High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), TLC is less restrictive as it does not require forward invariance of the intersection of a set of safe sets while HOCBFs do. We employ TLC to reformulate a constrained optimal control problem as a sequence of quadratic programs with a zero-order hold implementation method, and demonstrate the safety of zero-order hold TLC using an event-triggered control method to address inter-sampling effects. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed TLC method through an adaptive cruise control system and a robot control problem, and compare it with existing CBF methods."}

This paper proposes EXFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture specifically designed for forecasting the daily exchange rate returns. We introduce a multi-scale trend-aware self-attention mechanism that employs parallel convolutional branches with differing receptive fields to align observations on the basis of local slopes, preserving long-range dependencies while remaining sensitive to regime shifts. A dynamic variable selector assigns time-varying importance weights to 28 exogenous covariates related to exchange rate returns, providing pre-hoc interpretability. An embedded squeeze-and-excitation block recalibrates channel responses to emphasize informative features and depress noise in the forecasting. Using the daily data for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD, we conduct out-of-sample evaluations across five different sliding windows. EXFormer consistently outperforms the random walk and other baselines, improving directional accuracy by a statistically significant margin of up to 8.5--22.8%. In nearly one year of trading backtests, the model converts these gains into cumulative returns of 18%, 25%, and 18% for the three pairs, with Sharpe ratios exceeding 1.8. When conservative transaction costs and slippage are accounted for, EXFormer retains cumulative returns of 7%, 19%, and 9%, while other baselines achieve negative. The robustness checks further confirm the model's superiority under high-volatility and bear-market regimes. EXFormer furnishes both economically valuable forecasts and transparent, time-varying insights into the drivers of exchange rate dynamics for international investors, corporations, and central bank practitioners."}

Thus, finding ways to optimize their estimation is of great importance. We extend the application of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to the estimation of 10-day 97.5% ES and stressed ES, building on prior work applying DBNs to value at risk. Using the S&P 500 index as a proxy for the equities trading desk of a US bank, we compare the performance of three DBN structure-learning algorithms with several traditional market risk models, using either the normal or the skewed Student's t return distributions. Backtesting shows that all models fail to produce statistically accurate ES and SES forecasts at the 2.5% level, reflecting the difficulty of modeling extreme tail behavior. For ES, the EGARCH(1,1) model (normal) produces the most accurate forecasts, while, for SES, the GARCH(1,1) model (normal) performs best. All distribution-dependent models deteriorate substantially when using the skewed Student's t distribution. The DBNs perform comparably to the historical simulation model, but their contribution to tail prediction is limited by the small weight assigned to their one-day-ahead forecasts within the return distribution. Future research should examine weighting schemes that enhance the influence of forward-looking DBN forecasts on tail risk estimation."}

Cloud ERP solutions like Workday illustrate this evolution by incorporating machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing into a centralized data-driven ecosystem. As the complexity of AI-driven ERP solutions expands, traditional evaluation frameworks that look at cost, function, and user satisfaction suffer from a lack of consideration for algorithmic transparency, adaptability, or ethics. This review will systematically investigate the latest trends, models of computing architecture, and analytical methods applied in assessing the performance of AI-integrated ERP services, specifically on cloud-based platforms. Based on academic and industry sources, the paper distills current research in line with architectural integration, analytical methodologies, and organizational impact. It identifies critical performance metrics and emphasizes the absence of any standard assessment frameworks or AI-aware systems capable of evaluating automation efficiency, security concerns as well as flexible learning modes. We put forward a theoretical model that brings AI-enabled capabilities -- such as predictive intelligence or adaptive automation -- into alignment with metrics in performance assessment for ERPs. By combining current literature and identifying major gaps in research, this paper attempts to present a complete picture of how innovations in AI are changing ERP evaluation.

Symbolic Data Analysis extends this framework to more complex structures, such as intervals and histograms, that express internal variability. We propose an extension of multiclass Fisher's Discriminant Analysis to interval-valued data, using Moore's interval arithmetic and the Mallows' distance. Fisher's objective function is generalised to consider simultaneously the contributions of the centres and the ranges of intervals and is numerically maximised. The resulting discriminant directions are then used to classify interval-valued observations.To support visual assessment, we adapt the class map, originally introduced for conventional data, to classifiers that assign labels through minimum distance rules. We also extend the silhouette plot to this setting and use stacked mosaic plots to complement the visual display of class assignments. Together, these graphical tools provide insight into classifier performance and the strength of class membership. Applications to real datasets illustrate the proposed methodology and demonstrate its value in interpreting classification results for interval-valued data."}

Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery."}

Leveraging cross-sectional structural associations, the framework projects intervention scenarios as prioritization heuristics rather than causal estimates. A transparent linear regression model with R-squared of 95.9 identifies modifiable policy levers. Simulations indicate that foundational digital capabilities such as device access and expense tracking yield the highest projected gains, up to 5.5 percent, outperforming attitudinal nudges.

Momentum exhibits clear hyperbolic decay (R^2 = 0.65), outperforming linear (0.51) and exponential (0.61) baselines -- validating the equilibrium foundation. (2) Not all factors crowd equally.

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control. Overall, reusable value profiles provide a tractable computational account of belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments and yield testable signatures of belief-dependent control and behavioral flexibility."}

We test this hypothesis in the Iranian stock market, an economy that is highly isolated, subject to capital controls, and largely inaccessible to foreign investors. Using the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, we analyze two major bubble episodes in 2020 and 2023. The estimated critical exponents beta around 0.46 and 0.20 fall within the empirical ranges documented for canonical historical bubbles such as the 1929 DJIA crash and the 2000 Nasdaq episode. The Tehran Stock Exchange displays clear LPPLS hallmarks, including faster-than-exponential price acceleration, log-periodic corrections, and stable estimates of the critical time horizon. These results indicate that endogenous herding, imitation, and positive-feedback dynamics, rather than exogenous shocks, play a dominant role even in politically and economically isolated markets. By showing that an emerging and semi-closed financial system conforms to the same dynamical patterns observed in global markets, this paper provides new empirical support for the universality of bubble dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, it also presents the first systematic LPPLS analysis of bubbles in the Tehran Stock Exchange.

Further, we show that a small set of curators intermediates a disproportionate share of system TVL, exhibits clustered tail co movement, and captures markedly different fee margins despite broadly similar collateral composition. These findings indicate that the main locus of risk in DeFi lending has migrated upward from base protocols, where underwriting is effectively centralized in a single DAO governed parameter set, to a permissionless curator layer in which competing vault managers decide which assets and loans are originated. We argue that this shift requires a corresponding upgrade in transparency standards and outline a simple set of onchain disclosures that would allow users and DAOs to evaluate curator strategies on a comparable, money market style basis."}

The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents."}

Accecpted by APEC 2026", "summary": "Multi-active bridge (MAB) converters, the core of the state-of-the-art medium-voltage power electronic transformers, can flexibly connect multiple DC ports among distributed DC grids and loads, but suffer from hard switching under conventional single phase-shift control, especially under unbalanced voltage conversion ratios and light load conditions. Although some offline methods manage to improve the efficiency through complex optimization structures, there lacks online optimization methods that are simple but effective due to the strong coupling among ports of the converter. By leveraging the time-domain model of the MAB converter under the multiple phase-shift modulation scheme, this paper simplifies the optimization process and proposes an online optimization method that can achieve full zero-voltage switching (ZVS) operation regardless of the load conditions. The proposed method has simple solutions with only voltage conversion ratios involved and can be implemented within a wide operation range without additional sensors or advanced controllers. A four-port MAB converter is constructed as the prototype. The simulation and experimental results have verified the feasibility and superiority of the proposed online strategy in achieving ZVS operation, dynamic response, and efficiency improvement."}

As digital environments increasingly mediate these interactions, video games provide novel contexts for examining the psychological mechanisms underlying environmental behaviors. This study investigates how anthropocentric values are associated with resource-exploiting behaviors in virtual ecosystems--specifically, fishing, bug catching, and tree cutting--and how immersiveness moderates these relationships. Employing the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) to analyze data from 640 Animal Crossi,g: New Horizons (ACNH) players across 29 countries, the study reveals complex links between anthropocentric worldviews and in-game behaviors. Fishing and tree-cutting frequencies are positively associated with anthropocentrism, whereas immersiveness weakens the association between tree cutting and anthropocentrism. Bug-catching frequency shows no direct effect but exhibits a growing negative association with anthropocentrism as immersiveness increases. These findings extend environmental psychology into virtual ecologies, illustrating how digital interactions both reflect and reshape environmental values. They highlight the potential of immersive gameplay to cultivate the Nature Quotient (NQ) and foster an eco-surplus culture through reflective, conservation-oriented engagement."}

Taurus is a long-duration balloon instrument designed for rapid azimuthal scanning at approximately 30 deg/s using a motorized pivot at the flight-train connection, without a reaction wheel. We model the gondola as a rigid body subject to realistic disturbances and sensing limitations, and implement a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) that estimates attitude and gyroscope bias by fusing inertial and vector-camera measurements. A simple PI controller uses the estimated states to regulate yaw rate. Numerical simulations incorporating representative disturbance and measurement noise levels are used to evaluate closed-loop control performance and MEKF behavior under flight-like conditions. Experimental tests on the Taurus gondola validate the pivot-only approach, demonstrating stable high-rate tracking under realistic hardware constraints. The close agreement between simulation and experiment indicates that the simplified rigid-body model captures the dominant dynamics relevant for controller design and integrated estimation-and-control development."}

We experimentally demonstrate that the Coconut approach, a form of supervised fine-tuning for latent-space thinking, is highly sensitive to design choices and exhibits several inherent limitations. To address these issues, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) techniques -- an underexplored direction in latent-space thinking -- including GRPO and design a novel Latent RL method for directly optimizing the latent thinking steps. Our experimental results reveal that these RL-trained models still lag behind traditional language-space CoT models in the mathematical reasoning domain. We make our codebase publicly available."}

While prior research has highlighted a positive association between happiness and sustainable development, existing approaches largely rely on linear regressions or correlation-based measures that mask distributional heterogeneity, multicollinearity, and potential nonlinear dependence. To address these limitations, we employ a two methodological framework combining Graphical Lasso, and Quantile-on-Quantile Regression (QQR). The Graphical Lasso identifies a direct conditional link between happiness and sustainability after controlling for governance, income, and life expectancy, with a partial correlation of about 0.21. On the other hand, QQR reveals heterogeneous effects across the joint distribution: sustainability gains are positively associated with happiness for low-happiness but high-sustainability countries, negatively associated in high-happiness but low-sustainability contexts, and essentially neutral elsewhere. These findings suggest that the happiness-sustainability link is modest, asymmetric, and context-dependent, underscoring the importance of moving beyond mean-based regressions. From a policy perspective, our results highlight that institutional quality, income, and demographic factors remain the dominant drivers of both happiness and sustainability, while the interplay between the two dimensions is most pronounced in distributional extremes."}

We hedge a normalized option-implied equity exposure (one unit of underlying delta, offset via SPY) by trading the underlying index ETF, using the option surface and macro variables only as state information and not as a direct pricing engine. Building on the \"deep hedging\" paradigm of Buehler et al. (2019), we design a leak-free environment, a cost-aware reward function, and a lightweight stochastic actor-critic agent trained on daily end-of-day panel data constructed from SPX/SPY implied volatility term structure, skew, realized volatility, and macro rate context. On a fixed train/validation/test split, the learned policy improves risk-adjusted performance versus no-hedge, momentum, and volatility-targeting baselines (higher point-estimate Sharpe); only the GAE policy's test-sample Sharpe is statistically distinguishable from zero, although confidence intervals overlap with a long-SPY benchmark so we stop short of claiming formal dominance. Turnover remains controlled and the policy is robust to doubled transaction costs. The modular codebase, comprising a data pipeline, simulator, and training scripts, is engineered for extensibility to multi-asset overlays, alternative objectives (e.g., drawdown or CVaR), and intraday data. From a portfolio management perspective, the learned overlay is designed to sit on top of an existing SPX or SPY allocation, improving the portfolio's mean-variance trade-off with controlled turnover and drawdowns. We discuss practical implications for portfolio overlays and outline avenues for future work."}

Our methodology combines interpretable hypothesis-driven signal generation with reinforcement learning and strict out-of-sample testing. The framework enforces strict information set discipline, employs rolling window validation across 34 independent test periods, maintains complete interpretability through natural language hypothesis explanations, and incorporates realistic transaction costs and position constraints. Validating five market microstructure patterns across 100 US equities from 2015 to 2024, the system yields modest annualized returns (0.55%, Sharpe ratio 0.33) with exceptional downside protection (maximum drawdown -2.76%) and market-neutral characteristics (beta = 0.058). Performance exhibits strong regime dependence, generating positive returns during high-volatility periods (0.60% quarterly, 2020-2024) while underperforming in stable markets (-0.16%, 2015-2019). We report statistically insignificant aggregate results (p-value 0.34) to demonstrate a reproducible, honest validation protocol that prioritizes interpretability and extends naturally to advanced hypothesis generators, including large language models. The key empirical finding reveals that daily OHLCV-based microstructure signals require elevated information arrival and trading activity to function effectively. The framework provides complete mathematical specifications and open-source implementation, establishing a template for rigorous trading system evaluation that addresses the reproducibility crisis in quantitative finance research.

There is a large potential to minimize production costs through automated scheduling techniques, due to the large-scale requirements of modern factories. In the past, solution approaches have been studied for many machine scheduling variations, where even basic variants have been shown to be NP-hard. However, in today's real-life production environments, additional complex precedence constraints and resource restrictions with calendars arise that must be fulfilled. These additional constraints cannot be tackled efficiently by existing solution techniques. Thus, there is a strong need to develop and analyze automated methods that can solve such real-life parallel machine scheduling scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel variant of parallel machine scheduling with job precedences and calendar-based cumulative resource constraints that arises in real-life industrial use cases. A constraint modeling approach is proposed as an exact solution method for small scheduling scenarios together with state-of-the-art constraint-solving technology. Further, we propose a construction heuristic as well as a tailored metaheuristic using local search to efficiently tackle large-scale problem instances. This metaheuristic approach has been deployed and is currently being used in an industrial setting."}

Furthermore, a physics-informed neural surrogate predictor is proposed to accelerate predictions by DT and enable real-time operation. A gradient-free simplex search optimizer is also introduced to efficiently handle complex multi-objective optimization. The efficacy of the framework has been validated through a cloud-to-edge deployment on a 1500 W dual active bridge converter. Experimental results show that the synthesized predictive model achieves an inference speed over 7 times faster than real time, the DT-MPC controller outperforms several human-designed counterparts, and the overall framework reduces engineering design time by over 95\\%, verifying the superiority of DT-MPC on generalized power converters."}

Using CEEMDAN, we extract nine IMFs spanning high-frequency fluctuations to long-term trends. Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths. Visibility-based methods are more sensitive to amplitude variability and typically generate higher clustering, while recurrence graphs better preserve temporal dependencies. These results provide guidance for designing GNN architectures tailored to the structural properties of decomposed components, supporting more effective predictive modeling of financial time series."}

To achieve this, we expand a safety or stability function with respect to time along the system dynamics using the Lie derivative and Taylor's theorem. This expansion enables the control input to appear in the Taylor series at an order equivalent to the relative degree of the function. We show that the proposed TLC provides necessary and sufficient conditions for system safety and is applicable to systems and constraints of arbitrary relative degree. The TLC exhibits connections with existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) and Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) methods, and it further extends the CBF and CLF methods to the complex domain, especially for higher order cases. Compared to High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), TLC is less restrictive as it does not require forward invariance of the intersection of a set of safe sets while HOCBFs do. We employ TLC to reformulate a constrained optimal control problem as a sequence of quadratic programs with a zero-order hold implementation method, and demonstrate the safety of zero-order hold TLC using an event-triggered control method to address inter-sampling effects. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed TLC method through an adaptive cruise control system and a robot control problem, and compare it with existing CBF methods."}

We benchmark several leading models, providing the first set of baseline results for Khmer business documents, and discuss the distinct challenges posed by non-Latin, low-resource scripts. The KH-FUNSD dataset and documentation will be available at URL."}

Results show that the last IMFs, representing long-term trends, are generally the most influential according to DeepSHAP, whereas high-frequency IMFs contribute less and may even introduce noise, as evidenced by improved metrics upon their removal. Differences between MLP and LSTM highlight the effect of model architecture on feature relevance distribution, with LSTM allocating importance more evenly across IMFs."}

This study proposes a hybrid modelling framework that integrates a Stochastic Volatility model with a Long Short Term Memory neural network. The SV model improves statistical precision and captures latent volatility dynamics, especially in response to unforeseen events, while the LSTM network enhances the model's ability to detect complex nonlinear patterns in financial time series. The forecasting is conducted using daily data from the S and P 500 index, covering the period from January 1 1998 to December 31 2024. A rolling window approach is employed to train the model and generate one step ahead volatility forecasts. The performance of the hybrid SV-LSTM model is evaluated through both statistical testing and investment simulations. The results show that the hybrid approach outperforms both the standalone SV and LSTM models and contributes to the development of volatility modelling techniques, providing a foundation for improving risk assessment and strategic investment planning in the context of the S and P 500."}

However, their theoretical derivation and practical implementation are often closely coupled, which obscures the design space. To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting. Remarkably, the model requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. We believe our work lowers the barrier to component-level innovation in shortcut models and facilitates principled exploration of their design space."}

Current model-risk frameworks assume static, well-specified algorithms and one-time validations; large language models and multi-agent trading systems violate those assumptions by learning continuously, exchanging latent signals, and exhibiting emergent behavior. Drawing on complex adaptive systems theory, we model these technologies as decentralized ensembles whose risks propagate along multiple time-scales. We then propose a modular governance architecture. The framework decomposes oversight into four layers of \"regulatory blocks\": (i) self-regulation modules embedded beside each model, (ii) firm-level governance blocks that aggregate local telemetry and enforce policy, (iii) regulator-hosted agents that monitor sector-wide indicators for collusive or destabilizing patterns, and (iv) independent audit blocks that supply third-party assurance. Eight design strategies enable the blocks to evolve as fast as the models they police. A case study on emergent spoofing in multi-agent trading shows how the layered controls quarantine harmful behavior in real time while preserving innovation. The architecture remains compatible with today's model-risk rules yet closes critical observability and control gaps, providing a practical path toward resilient, adaptive AI governance in financial systems."}

Our first set of experiments find a suitable model for the task to imitate player demonstrations, using Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning: combining Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, and Proximal Policy Optimization.

Experiments show that this greedy scheme yields optimal or near-optimal congestion outcomes in realistic networks, even though global optimality is not guaranteed as we show with a counterexample.

This enabled opportunities for creative and positive uses of these models. However, it also enabled unprecedented opportunities for the low-effort creation of AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (AIG-NCII), including AI-generated child sexual abuse material (AIG-CSAM). Empirically, these harms were principally enabled by a small number of models that were trained on web data with pornographic content, released with open weights, and insufficiently safeguarded. In this paper, we observe ways in which the same patterns are emerging with video generation models in 2025. Specifically, we analyze how a small number of open-weight AI video generation models have become the dominant tools for videorealistic AIG-NCII video generation. We then analyze the literature on model safeguards and conclude that (1) developers who openly release the weights of capable video generation models without appropriate data curation and/or post-training safeguards foreseeably contribute to mitigatable downstream harm, and (2) model distribution platforms that do not proactively moderate individual misuse or models designed for AIG-NCII foreseeably amplify this harm. While there are no perfect defenses against AIG-NCII and AIG-CSAM from open-weight AI models, we argue that risk management by model developers and distributors, informed by emerging safeguard techniques, will substantially affect the future ease of creating AIG-NCII and AIG-CSAM with generative AI video tools."}

Current methodologies are predominantly confined to deducing a singular graph under the presumption that the observed data are uniform. However, many contexts involve heterogeneous datasets that feature multiple closely related graphs, typically referred to as multiview graphs. Previous research on multiview graph learning promotes edge-based similarity across layers using pairwise or consensus-based regularizers. However, multiview graphs frequently exhibit a shared node-based architecture across different views, such as common hub nodes. Such commonalities can enhance the precision of learning and provide interpretive insight. In this paper, we propose a co-hub node model, positing that different views share a common group of hub nodes. The associated optimization framework is developed by enforcing structured sparsity on the connections of these co-hub nodes. Moreover, we present a theoretical examination of layer identifiability and determine bounds on estimation error. The proposed methodology is validated using both synthetic graph data and fMRI time series data from multiple subjects to discern several closely related graphs."}

Calibration seeks to achieve this by improving the alignment between the model's confidence and the actual likelihood of its responses being correct or desirable. However, it has been observed that the internal confidence of a model, derived from token probabilities, is not well aligned with its verbalized confidence, leading to misleading results with different calibration methods. In this paper, we propose Direct Confidence Alignment (DCA), a method using Direct Preference Optimization to align an LLM's verbalized confidence with its internal confidence rather than ground-truth accuracy, enhancing model transparency and reliability by ensuring closer alignment between the two confidence measures. We evaluate DCA across multiple open-weight LLMs on a wide range of datasets. To further assess this alignment, we also introduce three new calibration error-based metrics. Our results show that DCA improves alignment metrics on certain model architectures, reducing inconsistencies in a model's confidence expression. However, we also show that it can be ineffective on others, highlighting the need for more model-aware approaches in the pursuit of more interpretable and trustworthy LLMs."}

We derive a master equation governing propagation from three economic foundations -- heterogeneous agent aggregation, market equilibrium, and cost minimization -- establishing that the framework rests on fundamental principles rather than ad hoc specifications. A key result shows that the spatial-network interaction coefficient equals the mutual information between geographic and market coordinates. The Feynman-Kac representation decomposes effects into inherited and accumulated components along stochastic paths representing economic linkages. The framework nests the no-spillover case as a testable restriction. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that conventional estimators -- two-way fixed effects, difference-in-differences, and generalized propensity score -- exhibit 25-38% bias and severe undercoverage when spillovers exist, while our estimator maintains correct inference regardless of whether spillovers are present. Applying the framework to U.S. minimum wage policy, we reject the no-spillover null and find total effects at state borders four times larger than direct effects -- conventional methods capture only one-quarter of policy impact. Structural estimates reveal spatial diffusion consistent with commuting-distance labor mobility, network diffusion consistent with quarterly supply chain adjustment, and significant spatial-network interaction reflecting geographic clustering of industries.

We hedge a normalized option-implied equity exposure (one unit of underlying delta, offset via SPY) by trading the underlying index ETF, using the option surface and macro variables only as state information and not as a direct pricing engine. Building on the \"deep hedging\" paradigm of Buehler et al. (2019), we design a leak-free environment, a cost-aware reward function, and a lightweight stochastic actor-critic agent trained on daily end-of-day panel data constructed from SPX/SPY implied volatility term structure, skew, realized volatility, and macro rate context. On a fixed train/validation/test split, the learned policy improves risk-adjusted performance versus no-hedge, momentum, and volatility-targeting baselines (higher point-estimate Sharpe); only the GAE policy's test-sample Sharpe is statistically distinguishable from zero, although confidence intervals overlap with a long-SPY benchmark so we stop short of claiming formal dominance. Turnover remains controlled and the policy is robust to doubled transaction costs. The modular codebase, comprising a data pipeline, simulator, and training scripts, is engineered for extensibility to multi-asset overlays, alternative objectives (e.g., drawdown or CVaR), and intraday data. From a portfolio management perspective, the learned overlay is designed to sit on top of an existing SPX or SPY allocation, improving the portfolio's mean-variance trade-off with controlled turnover and drawdowns. We discuss practical implications for portfolio overlays and outline avenues for future work."}

While the utility of adding user data often exhibits diminishing returns (i.e., submodularity), enabling near-optimal greedy selection, real-world personalization is complicated by structural constraints. These include logical dependencies (e.g., selecting fact A requires fact B), categorical quotas (e.g., select at most one writing style), and hierarchical rules (e.g., select at most two social media preferences, of which at most one can be for a professional network). These constraints violate the assumptions of standard subset selection algorithms. We propose a principled method to formally model such constraints. We introduce a compilation process that transforms a user's knowledge graph with dependencies into a set of abstract macro-facets. Our central result is a proof that common hierarchical and quota-based constraints over these macro-facets form a valid laminar matroid.

Validating five market microstructure patterns across 100 US equities from 2015 to 2024, the system yields modest annualized returns (0.55%, Sharpe ratio 0.33) with exceptional downside protection (maximum drawdown -2.76%) and market-neutral characteristics (beta = 0.058). Performance exhibits strong regime dependence, generating positive returns during high-volatility periods (0.60% quarterly, 2020-2024) while underperforming in stable markets (-0.16%, 2015-2019). We report statistically insignificant aggregate results (p-value 0.34) to demonstrate a reproducible, honest validation protocol that prioritizes interpretability and extends naturally to advanced hypothesis generators, including large language models. The key empirical finding reveals that daily OHLCV-based microstructure signals require elevated information arrival and trading activity to function effectively. The framework provides complete mathematical specifications and open-source implementation, establishing a template for rigorous trading system evaluation that addresses the reproducibility crisis in quantitative finance research.

Gaussian process regression (GPR) models are a natural way to model data with Gaussian-distributed uncertainties. GPR also has the benefit of reducing I/O bandwidth and storage requirements for large scientific simulations. However, the reconstruction from the GPR models suffers from high computation complexity. To make the situation worse, classic approaches for visualizing the data uncertainties, like probabilistic marching cubes, are also computationally very expensive, especially for data of high resolutions. In this paper, we accelerate the level-crossing probability calculation efficiency on GPR models by subdividing the data spatially into a hierarchical data structure and only reconstructing values adaptively in the regions that have a non-zero probability. For each region, leveraging the known GPR kernel and the saved data observations, we propose a novel approach to efficiently calculate an upper bound for the level-crossing probability inside the region and use this upper bound to make the subdivision and reconstruction decisions. We demonstrate that our value occurrence probability estimation is accurate with a low computation cost by experiments that calculate the level-crossing probability fields on different datasets."}

Although some offline methods manage to improve the efficiency through complex optimization structures, there lacks online optimization methods that are simple but effective due to the strong coupling among ports of the converter. By leveraging the time-domain model of the MAB converter under the multiple phase-shift modulation scheme, this paper simplifies the optimization process and proposes an online optimization method that can achieve full zero-voltage switching (ZVS) operation regardless of the load conditions. The proposed method has simple solutions with only voltage conversion ratios involved and can be implemented within a wide operation range without additional sensors or advanced controllers. A four-port MAB converter is constructed as the prototype. The simulation and experimental results have verified the feasibility and superiority of the proposed online strategy in achieving ZVS operation, dynamic response, and efficiency improvement."}

Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces. We also find that eviction strategies at low budgets can produce longer reasoning traces, revealing a tradeoff between cache size and inference costs."}

The power system operation is characterized by the economic dispatch optimization, while the transportation system user equilibrium models travelers' route and charging choices.

In contexts of emotional need or instability, this tension can lead users to resolve the conflict through imaginative projection, attributing interiority, intention, or presence to a system that possesses none.

Recent advances in modern machine learning have revealed a more complex pattern, double-descent, in which test loss, after peaking near the interpolation threshold, decreases again as model capacity continues to grow. While this behavior has been extensively analyzed in regression and classification, its manifestation in survival analysis remains unexplored. This study investigates double-descent in four representative survival models: DeepSurv, PC-Hazard, Nnet-Survival, and N-MTLR. We rigorously define interpolation and finite-norm interpolation, two key characteristics of loss-based models to understand double-descent. We then show the existence (or absence) of (finite-norm) interpolation of all four models. Our findings clarify how likelihood-based losses and model implementation jointly determine the feasibility of interpolation and show that overfitting should not be regarded as benign for survival models. All theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments that highlight the distinct generalization behaviors of survival models."}

We show that the standard assumption of lower semicontinuity of the set-valued constraint maps - foundational in the current literature on GNEPs - can be replaced by graph convexity or the so-called Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) property. Lower semicontinuity is often essential for obtaining upper semicontinuity of best response maps, crucial for the existence theory based on Kakutani-Fan fixed-point arguments. However, in function spaces or PDE-constrained settings, verifying lower semicontinuity becomes much more challenging (even in convex cases), whereas graph convexity, for example, is often straightforward to check. Our results unify several existence theorems in the literature and clarify the structural role of constraint maps.

Furthermore, a physics-informed neural surrogate predictor is proposed to accelerate predictions by DT and enable real-time operation. A gradient-free simplex search optimizer is also introduced to efficiently handle complex multi-objective optimization. The efficacy of the framework has been validated through a cloud-to-edge deployment on a 1500 W dual active bridge converter.

However, assessing their accuracy and reliability remains a challenge. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside advanced prompting techniques and agent-based methods to evaluate the extent to which ConvQA system responses adhere to user utterances. The focus lies on contextual understanding and the ability to provide accurate venue recommendations considering user constraints and situational context. To evaluate utterance-response coherence using an LLM, we synthetically generate user utterances accompanied by correct and modified failure-containing system responses. We use input-output, chain-of-thought, self-consistency prompting, and multi-agent prompting techniques with 13 reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs of varying sizes and providers, including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Mistral AI, and Meta. We evaluate our approach on a case study involving restaurant recommendations. The most substantial improvements occur for small non-reasoning models when applying advanced prompting techniques, particularly multi-agent prompting. However, reasoning models consistently outperform non-reasoning models, with the best performance achieved using single-agent prompting with self-consistency. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 reaches an F1-score of 0.99 at a cost of 0.002 USD per request. Overall, the best balance between effectiveness and cost-time efficiency is reached with the non-reasoning model DeepSeek-V3. Our findings show that LLM-based evaluation offers a scalable and accurate alternative to traditional human evaluation for benchmarking contextual understanding in ConvQA systems."}

This resulting density estimator is then used as input into a parametric moment condition. We establish consistency and convergence rates for both the raking-based density estimator and the resulting moment estimator when the distributions of the observed data are parametric.

This ensures that the learned correction targets only the unknown components of model bias, preserving the interpretability and fidelity of the physical model. An optimal sensor placement strategy is also investigated to maximize information gained from measurements.

By contrast, under the same levels of data corruption, class-conditional diffusion models degrade catastrophically (image-label consistency plummets by 56.81% relative to baseline), while classifiers show a moderate impact that diminishes with dataset scale. To explain these discrepancies, we analyze the results through a multi-perspective lens, integrating information theory, PAC learning, and gradient dynamics. These analyses suggest that robustness is heavily influenced by two key principles: the richness of conditioning information, which constrains the learning problem, and the absolute information content of the training data, which allows the signal from correct information to dominate statistical noise."}

Existing work primarily addresses Sinkhorn DRO from a dual perspective, leveraging its formulation as a conditional stochastic optimization problem, for which many stochastic gradient methods are applicable. However, the theoretical analyses of such methods often rely on the boundedness of the loss function, and it is indirect to obtain the worst-case distribution associated with Sinkhorn DRO. In contrast, we study Sinkhorn DRO from the primal perspective, by reformulating it as a bilevel program with several infinite-dimensional lower-level subproblems over probability space. This formulation enables us to simultaneously obtain the optimal robust decision and the worst-case distribution, which is valuable in practical settings, such as generating stress-test scenarios or designing robust learning algorithms. We propose both double-loop and single-loop sampling-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees to solve this bilevel program.

The method recognizes that, for many customers, treatment effects are so extreme that additional accuracy is unlikely to change the recommended actions. However, accuracy matters near the decision boundary, as small errors can alter targeting decisions. By modifying the firm's objective function in the standard profit maximization problem, our method yields a near-optimal targeting policy while simultaneously estimating CATEs.

During the autoregressive decoding process, KV caches consume substantial GPU memory, limiting batch sizes and overall system throughput. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{CXL-SpecKV}, a novel disaggregated KV-cache architecture that leverages Compute Express Link (CXL) interconnects and FPGA accelerators to enable efficient speculative execution and memory disaggregation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (i) a CXL-based memory disaggregation framework that offloads KV-caches to remote FPGA memory with low latency, (ii) a speculative KV-cache prefetching mechanism that predicts and preloads future tokens' cache entries, and (iii) an FPGA-accelerated KV-cache compression and decompression engine that reduces memory bandwidth requirements by up to 4$\\times$. When evaluated on state-of-the-art LLM models, CXL-SpecKV achieves up to 3.2$\\times$ higher throughput compared to GPU-only baselines, while reducing memory costs by 2.8$\\times$ and maintaining accuracy.

This paper proposes an AI-powered scoring system that integrates existing PSS sensors with additional accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetic/RFID, and impact force sensors in a sensor fusion framework. The system classifies kicks in real-time to identify technique type, contact location, impact force, and even the part of the foot used.

We present a novel kick scoring rubric that awards points based on specific kick techniques (e.g., turning and spinning kicks) to incentivize dynamic attacks. Drawing on a 2024 study achieving 96-98% accuracy, we validate the feasibility of real-time kick classification and further propose enhancements to this methodology, such as ensemble SVM classifiers and expanded datasets, to achieve the high-stakes accuracy required by the sport.

Although Gaussian process models excel at capturing smooth nonlinear relationships, their stationarity assumptions limit their ability to adapt to sudden input-output variations. Existing nonstationary extensions, particularly those based on domain partitioning, often struggle with boundary inconsistencies, sensitivity to outliers, and scalability issues in higher-dimensional settings, leading to reduced predictive accuracy and unreliable parameter estimation.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Robust Local Gaussian Process (RLGP) model, a framework that integrates adaptive nearest-neighbor selection with a sparsity-driven robustification mechanism. Unlike existing methods, RLGP leverages an optimization-based mean-shift adjustment after a multivariate perspective transformation combined with local neighborhood modeling to mitigate the influence of outliers. This approach improves predictive accuracy near discontinuities while enhancing robustness to data heterogeneity.\n  Comprehensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that RLGP consistently delivers high predictive accuracy and maintains competitive computational efficiency, especially in scenarios with sharp transitions and complex response structures. Scalability tests further confirm RLGP's stability and reliability in higher-dimensional settings, where other methods struggle. These results establish RLGP as an effective and practical solution for modeling nonstationary and discontinuous response surfaces across a wide range of applications."}

To address this challenge, we introduce BLASST, a drop-in sparse attention method that dynamically prunes the attention matrix without any pre-computation or proxy scores. Our method uses a fixed threshold and existing information from online softmax to identify negligible attention scores, skipping softmax computation, Value block loading, and the subsequent matrix multiplication. This fits seamlessly into existing FlashAttention kernel designs with negligible latency overhead. The approach is applicable to both prefill and decode stages across all attention variants (MHA, GQA, MQA, and MLA), providing a unified solution for accelerating long-context inference. We develop an automated calibration procedure that reveals a simple inverse relationship between optimal threshold and context length, enabling robust deployment across diverse scenarios. Maintaining high accuracy, we demonstrate a 1.62x speedup for prefill at 74.7% sparsity and a 1.48x speedup for decode at 73.2% sparsity on modern GPUs.

This paper argues that DPO does not rewrite a models internal beliefs; instead, it acts as a low rank steering mechanism that nudges activations along a small number of preference directions. Using a simple derivation, we show that the DPO gradient depends only on the difference between the logit embeddings of preferred and dispreferred completions, implying a first order shift in the final hidden representation rather than a deep restructuring of semantics. We then extract an empirical steering vector from a DPO tuned model and demonstrate that adding this vector to base activations reproduces most of the aligned behavior, while subtracting it nearly restores the original model. Finally, spectral analyses reveal rank-one dominance and entropy collapse in upper layers, indicating that alignment is funneled through a narrow subspace. Taken together, these results support a behavioral illusion view of DPO: it teaches models how to act aligned, not what to believe."}

State transition tensors (STTs), higher-order Taylor series expansions of the solution flow, have been widely used as a computationally efficient semi-analytical propagation method for orbital scenarios, but have not previously been applied to aerocapture. However, obtaining the higher-order STTs requires integrating exponentially more equations. Directional state transition tensors (DSTTs) mitigate this cost by projecting the state into a reduced-dimension basis. This work develops novel dynamics analysis techniques to identify effective bases for this reduction, including augmented higher-order Cauchy Green tensors tailored to quantities of interest such as apoapsis radius. Results show that DSTTs constructed along these bases significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy in apoapsis and energy prediction. In particular, certain of these DSTTs outperform traditional DSTTs in nonlinear perturbation propagation for key state subsets and quantities of interest. These results establish STTs and DSTTs as practical tools for aerocapture performance analysis to enable robust guidance and navigation."}

Results showed four unique student profiles with varying in trust and usage intensity. While students acknowledged AI tools' benefits, dependency remained low due to limited infrastructure and insufficient exposure. High-frequency users did not necessarily report greater trust or usefulness which may indicates a complex relationship between usage patterns and perception.

Recovering the true population $R^2$, therefore, requires correcting observed predictive performance by this bound. Using a broad set of variables, including excess returns, yields, credit spreads, and valuation ratios, we find that the implied LLGs are large. This indicates that standard ML approaches can substantially understate true predictability in financial data. We also derive LLG-based refinements to the classic Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) bounds, analyze implications for parameter learning in general-equilibrium settings, and show that the LLG provides a natural mechanism for generating excess volatility."}

We operate in the high-dimensional and highly-constrained setting, where oracle access is restricted to one or a few objective and constraint gradients per-iteration, as in streaming or online estimation. Existing approaches to solve such problems are based on either the stochastic primal-dual or stochastic subgradient methods, and require globally Lipschitz continuous constraint functions. In this work, we develop a hinge-proximal framework that utilizes an exact penalty reformulation to yield updates involving only one linearized constraint (and hence accessing one constraint gradient) per-iteration. The updates also admit a novel hinge-proximal three-point inequality relying on smoothness rather than global Lipschitz continuity of the constraint functions. The framework leads to three algorithms: a baseline hinge-proximal SGD (HPS), a variance-reduced HPS version for finite-sum settings, and a nested HPS version whose performance depends on a geometric regularity constant of the constraint region rather than explicitly on the number of constraints, while achieving near-SGD sample complexity. The superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on a robust regression problem with noisy features, representative of errors-in-variables estimation."}

The power system operation is characterized by the economic dispatch optimization, while the transportation system user equilibrium models travelers' route and charging choices. By analyzing simple coupled systems, we demonstrate that capacity expansion in either transportation or power system can deteriorate the performance of both systems, and uncover the fundamental mechanisms for such new Braess' paradoxes to occur. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions of the occurrences of Braess' paradoxes for general coupled systems, leading to managerial insights for infrastructure planners.

In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context. Our findings hold across different models and dataset sizes, far outperforming previous specialized architectures and established rotary positional embedding scaling methods."}

However, the dominant paradigm for network optimization relies on designing specialist policies based on handcrafted rules or deep learning models, leading to poor generalization across diverse tasks and environments. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), pretrained on Internet-scale corpora, provide a rich and unified knowledge base that encodes fundamental networking principles. Combined with their emergent abilities in generalization to unseen scenarios, LLMs offer a transformative foundation for generalist network policies that can generalize across diverse tasks and environments with minimal adaptation. In this paper, we present Trailblazer, the first systematic framework to realize such a generalist policy for networking. Trailblazer incorporates a network alignment scheme to ground the LLM in specific networking tasks, and an adaptive policy collaboration mechanism that offloads simple control cases from the LLM to a lightweight policy for computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations and large-scale real-world online evaluation on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), Trailblazer, powered by a single LLM, demonstrates stronger cross-task and cross-environment generalization than conventional specialist policies. Our results validate LLMs as the foundation for generalist network policies, and position Trailblazer as the first step toward the generalist-driven paradigm that enables strong generalization with minimal efforts in policy design."}

While typical game-theoretic assumptions often overlook such heterogeneity, hypergame theory provides the mathematical framework to reason about mismatched mental models. Although hypergames have recently gained traction in dynamic applications concerning uncertainty, their practical adoption in multi-agent system research has been hindered by the lack of a unifying, formal, and practical representation language, as well as scalable algorithms for managing complex hypergame structures and equilibria. Our work addresses this gap by introducing a declarative, logic-based domain-specific language for encoding hypergame structures and hypergame solution concepts. Leveraging answer-set programming, we develop an automated pipeline for instantiating hypergame structures and running our novel hypergame rationalisation procedure, a mechanism for finding belief structures that justify seemingly irrational outcomes. The proposed language establishes a unifying formalism for hypergames and serves as a foundation for developing nuanced, belief-based heterogeneous reasoners, offering a verifiable context with logical guarantees.

Concerns about AI tools and social norms have weaker effects on teachers' perceptions. The study emphasized critical role of trust in shaping teachers' perceptions of AI detection tools. Teachers who trust these tools are more likely to view them as fair and effective. In contrast, concerns and social norms have a limited influence on perceptions and decision-making. For recommendations, training and institutional guidelines should emphasize how these tools work, their limitations, and best practices for their use.

Unlike transport reversible jump methods relying on forward KL minimization with pilot MCMC samples, our approach minimizes the reverse KL divergence which requires only samples from a base distribution, eliminating costly target sampling. The method employs RealNVP-based flows to learn model-specific transport maps, enabling construction of both between-model and within-model proposals. Our framework provides accurate marginal likelihood estimates from the variational approximation. This facilitates efficient model comparison and proposal adaptation in RJMCMC. Experiments on illustrative example, factor analysis and variable selection tasks in linear regression show that TRJ designed by VI-NFs achieves faster mixing and more efficient model space exploration compared to existing baselines. The proposed algorithm can be extended to conditional flows for amortized vairiational inference across models. Code is available at https://github.com/YinPingping111/TRJ_VINFs."}

The random approximation is constructed by dividing the time interval into subintervals and restricting the dynamics to a randomly chosen subnetwork during each of these subintervals. It is proven that the solution for this randomized system converges in expectation to the solution on the original network when the length of the subintervals approaches zero. Furthermore, the optimal controls for the randomized system converge (in $H^2$ and in expectation) to the optimal controls for the original system. The computational advantage of the proposed method is demonstrated in two numerical examples."}

During inference, DLMs generate text by iteratively denoising masked sequences in parallel; however, determining which positions to unmask and which tokens to commit forms a large combinatorial search problem. Existing inference methods approximate this search using heuristics, which often yield suboptimal decoding paths; other approaches instead rely on additional training to guide token selection. To introduce a principled search mechanism for DLMs inference, we introduce MEDAL, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree SEarch initialization for Diffusion LAnguage Model inference. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search at the initialization stage to explore promising unmasking trajectories, providing a robust starting point for subsequent refinement. This integration is enabled by restricting the search space to high-confidence actions and prioritizing token choices that improve model confidence over remaining masked positions. Across multiple benchmarks, MEDAL achieves up to 22.0% improvement over existing inference strategies, establishing a new paradigm for search-based inference in diffusion language models."}

EnrichLog incorporates contextual information, including historical examples and reasoning derived from the corpus, to enable more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection.

We evaluate EnrichLog on four large-scale system log benchmark datasets and compare it against five baseline methods.

Then, we design position-tracking controllers for the robots. By appropriately designing the objective function and the constraints for the QP, it is guaranteed that the QP admits a unique solution and the QP-based velocity-tracking controller is Lipschitz continuous. Finally, we consider the closed-loop system as an interconnection of two subsystems, corresponding to the velocity-tracking error of the object and the position-tracking error of the robots, and employ nonlinear small-gain techniques for stability analysis.

This study examines the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), ChatGPT GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, to assess greenspace attractiveness similarly to humans using Google Street View imagery. We compared model outputs with responses from a geo-questionnaire of residents in Lodz, Poland, across both formal (for example, parks and managed greenspaces) and informal (for example, meadows and wastelands) greenspaces. Survey respondents and models indicated whether each greenspace was attractive or unattractive and provided up to three free text explanations. Analyses examined how often their attractiveness judgments aligned and compared their explanations after classifying them into shared reasoning categories. Results show high AI human agreement for attractive formal greenspaces and unattractive informal spaces, but low alignment for attractive informal and unattractive formal greenspaces. Models consistently emphasized aesthetic and design oriented features, underrepresenting safety, functional infrastructure, and locally embedded qualities valued by survey respondents. While these findings highlight the potential for scalable pre-assessment, they also underscore the need for human oversight and complementary participatory approaches. We conclude that MLLMs can support, but not replace, context sensitive greenspace evaluation in planning practice."}

We first propose a PAC-Bayes bound for multivariate linear regression, extending the earlier bound for single-output linear regression by Shalaeva et al., and establish sufficient conditions for its convergence. We then show that LAEs, when evaluated under a relaxed mean squared error, can be interpreted as constrained multivariate linear regression models on bounded data, to which our bound adapts. Furthermore, we develop theoretical methods to improve the computational efficiency of optimizing the LAE bound, enabling its practical evaluation on large models and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our bound is tight and correlates well with practical ranking metrics such as Recall@K and NDCG@K."}

From a mathematical perspective, a semantic distance can be viewed as a metric defined on a space of texts or on a representation space derived from them. However, most classical semantic distance methods are essentially fixed, making them difficult to adapt to specific data distributions and task requirements. In this paper, a semantic distance measure based on multi-kernel Gaussian processes (MK-GP) was proposed. The latent semantic function associated with texts was modeled as a Gaussian process, with its covariance function given by a combined kernel combining Matérn and polynomial components. The kernel parameters were learned automatically from data under supervision, rather than being hand-crafted. This semantic distance was instantiated and evaluated in the context of fine-grained sentiment classification with large language models under an in-context learning (ICL) setup.

Evaluated on a reproducible GeoLife and DeepMIMO pipeline, our method achieves 4.46 m ADE and 7.79 m FDE in zero-shot settings, improves few-shot ADE to 3.71 m at 10-shot, and enables recovery from abrupt drift about 2 to 3 times faster than an offline GRU. When applied to downstream HO prediction, the approach improves F1 to 0.83 and AUROC to 0.90, with substantial reductions in missed-HO and ping-pong events.

Using on-chain data, it is explored how retail-focused token creation platforms are reshaping blockchain ecosystems and influencing market participation. This study finds that Pump.fun accounted for up to 71.1% of all tokens minted on Solana and contributed 40-67.4% of total DEX transactions. Despite this activity, fewer than 2% of tokens successfully transitioned to major decentralized exchanges, highlighting a highly speculative market structure. The platform experienced rapid growth, with daily active users rising from 60,000 to peaks of 260,000, underscoring strong retail adoption. This reflects a broader shift towards accessible, socially-driven market participation enabled by memecoins. However, while memecoins lower entry barriers and encourage retail engagement, they introduce significant risks. The volatile and speculative nature of these platforms raises concerns about long-term sustainability and the resilience of the blockchain ecosystem. These findings reveal the dual impact of memecoins: they democratize token creation and alter market dynamics but may jeopardize market efficiency and stability.

State transition tensors (STTs), higher-order Taylor series expansions of the solution flow, have been widely used as a computationally efficient semi-analytical propagation method for orbital scenarios, but have not previously been applied to aerocapture. However, obtaining the higher-order STTs requires integrating exponentially more equations. Directional state transition tensors (DSTTs) mitigate this cost by projecting the state into a reduced-dimension basis. This work develops novel dynamics analysis techniques to identify effective bases for this reduction, including augmented higher-order Cauchy Green tensors tailored to quantities of interest such as apoapsis radius. Results show that DSTTs constructed along these bases significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy in apoapsis and energy prediction. In particular, certain of these DSTTs outperform traditional DSTTs in nonlinear perturbation propagation for key state subsets and quantities of interest. These results establish STTs and DSTTs as practical tools for aerocapture performance analysis to enable robust guidance and navigation."}

Using interpretable classifiers over bag-of-segment features, we find that phonological form predicts size semantics above chance even across unrelated languages, with both vowels and consonants contributing. To probe universality beyond genealogy, we train an adversarial scrubber that suppresses language identity while preserving size signal (also at family granularity). Language prediction averaged across languages and settings falls below chance while size prediction remains significantly above chance, indicating cross-family sound-symbolic bias.

Recent advances in patch-based Transformer models have shown strong potential in various time series forecasting tasks. However, most existing methods rely on fixed-size patch embedding, making it difficult to model the complex and heterogeneous patterns of airport passenger flows. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deformable temporal-spectral transformer named DTSFormer that integrates a multiscale deformable partitioning module and a joint temporal-spectral filtering module. Specifically, the input sequence is dynamically partitioned into multiscale temporal patches via a novel window function-based masking, enabling the extraction of heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. Then, within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to capture both high- and low-frequency components, thereby emphasizing the volatility and periodicity inherent in airport passenger flows. Finally, the resulting multi-frequency features are subsequently fused in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world passenger flow data collected at Beijing Capital International Airport from January 2023 to March 2024. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons. Further analysis shows that the deformable partitioning module aligns patch lengths with dominant periods and heterogeneous trends, enabling superior capture of sudden high-frequency fluctuations."}

We propose The Forecast Critic, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated forecast monitoring, taking advantage of their broad world knowledge and strong ``reasoning'' capabilities. As a prerequisite for this, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to assess time series forecast quality, focusing on three key questions. (1) Can LLMs be deployed to perform forecast monitoring and identify obviously unreasonable forecasts? (2) Can LLMs effectively incorporate unstructured exogenous features to assess what a reasonable forecast looks like? (3) How does performance vary across model sizes and reasoning capabilities, measured across state-of-the-art LLMs? We present three experiments, including on both synthetic and real-world forecasting data. Our results show that LLMs can reliably detect and critique poor forecasts, such as those plagued by temporal misalignment, trend inconsistencies, and spike errors. The best-performing model we evaluated achieves an F1 score of 0.88, somewhat below human-level performance (F1 score: 0.97). We also demonstrate that multi-modal LLMs can effectively incorporate unstructured contextual signals to refine their assessment of the forecast. Models correctly identify missing or spurious promotional spikes when provided with historical context about past promotions (F1 score: 0.84). Lastly, we demonstrate that these techniques succeed in identifying inaccurate forecasts on the real-world M5 time series dataset, with unreasonable forecasts having an sCRPS at least 10% higher than that of reasonable forecasts. These findings suggest that LLMs, even without domain-specific fine-tuning, may provide a viable and scalable option for automated forecast monitoring and evaluation."}

To address this, this paper proposes an end-to-end decision-focused framework that jointly optimizes probabilistic forecasting and robust operation for microgrids. A multilayer encoder-decoder (MED) probabilistic forecasting model is integrated with a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model involving direct load control (DLC) through a differentiable decision pathway, enabling gradient-based feedback from operational outcomes to improve forecasting performance. Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations. The results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the end-to-end decision-focused approach for resilient and cost-efficient microgrid management under uncertainty."}

At the same time, AI's environmental footprint is expanding increasingly. This report describes the systemic environmental risks of artificial intelligence, in particular, moving beyond direct impacts such as energy and water usage. Systemic environmental risks of AI are emergent, cross-sector harms to climate, biodiversity, freshwater, and broader socioecological systems that arise primarily from AI's integration into social, economic, and physical infrastructures, rather than its direct resource use, and that propagate through feedbacks, yielding nonlinear, inequitable, and potentially irreversible impacts. While these risks are emergent and quantification is uncertain, this report aims to provide an overview of systemic environmental risks. Drawing on a narrative literature review, we propose a three-level framework that operationalizes systemic risk analysis. The framework identifies the structural conditions that shape AI development, the risk amplification mechanisms that propagate environmental harm, and the impacts that manifest as observable ecological and social consequences. We illustrate the framework in expert-interview-based case studies across agriculture and biodiversity, oil and gas, and waste management."}

While widely studied in classification, OOD detection for regression and survival analysis remains limited due to the absence of discrete labels and the challenge of quantifying predictive uncertainty. We introduce a framework for OOD detection that is simultaneously model aware and subspace aware, and that embeds variable prioritization directly into the detection step. The method uses the fitted predictor to construct localized neighborhoods around each test case that emphasize the features driving the model's learned relationship and downweight directions that are less relevant to prediction. It produces OOD scores without relying on global distance metrics or estimating the full feature density. The framework is applicable across outcome types, and in our implementation we use random forests, where the rule structure yields transparent neighborhoods and effective scoring. Experiments on synthetic and real data benchmarks designed to isolate functional shifts show consistent improvements over existing methods. We further demonstrate the approach in an esophageal cancer survival study, where distribution shifts related to lymphadenectomy identify patterns relevant to surgical guidelines."}

By feasible-set reshaping, we project the constraints of the original feasible set onto an appropriately chosen constant matrix with its rows forming a positive span of the space of the optimization variable. It is proved that the reshaped feasible set is nonempty and satisfies LICQ, as long as the original feasible set is nonempty.

This kind of bias has been validated to correlate with topological structure and is considered as a bottleneck of GNNs' performance. Existing work focuses on the study of homogeneous GNNs and little attention has been given to topological bias in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs). In this work, firstly, in order to distinguish distinct meta relations, we apply meta-weighting to the adjacency matrix of a heterogeneous graph. Based on the modified adjacency matrix, we leverage PageRank along with the node label information to construct a projection. The constructed projection effectively maps nodes to values that strongly correlated with model performance when using datasets both with and without intra-type connections, which demonstrates the universal existence of topological bias in HGNNs. To handle this bias, we propose a debiasing structure based on the difference in the mapped values of nodes and use it along with the original graph structure for contrastive learning.

Classical SSP formulations rely on sum-aggregated costs, which are suitable for cumulative quantities such as time or energy but fail to capture bottleneck-style objectives such as avoiding high-risk transitions, where performance is determined by the worst single event along a trajectory. Such objectives are particularly important in safety-critical systems, where even one hazardous transition can be unacceptable. To address this limitation, we introduce max-aggregated objectives that minimize the bottleneck cost, i.e., the maximum one-step cost along a trajectory. We show that standard Bellman equations on the original state space do not apply in this setting and propose an augmented MDP with a state variable tracking the running maximum cost, together with a value iteration algorithm. We further identify a cyclic policy phenomenon, where zero-marginal-cost cycles prevent goal reaching under max-aggregation, and resolve it via a finite-horizon formulation. To handle richer task requirements, linear temporal logic specifications are translated into deterministic finite automata and combined with the system to construct a product MDP. We propose a lexicographic value iteration algorithm that handles mixed max-sum objectives under lexicographic ordering on this product MDP. Gridworld case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."}

To solve the problem, we first treat the robots' positions as virtual control inputs of the object, and propose a velocity-tracking controller based on quadratic programming (QP), enabling the robots to cooperatively generate desired contact forces while minimizing the sum of the contact-force magnitudes. Then, we design position-tracking controllers for the robots. By appropriately designing the objective function and the constraints for the QP, it is guaranteed that the QP admits a unique solution and the QP-based velocity-tracking controller is Lipschitz continuous. Finally, we consider the closed-loop system as an interconnection of two subsystems, corresponding to the velocity-tracking error of the object and the position-tracking error of the robots, and employ nonlinear small-gain techniques for stability analysis.

To preserve the existing capabilities of the model (voice cloning, English and Chinese support), we keep the original weights frozen, append a sub-network to the model and train it as an extension for the textual embedding matrix of the text encoder. For simplicity, we rely on ConvNeXt module implemented in F5-TTS to also model the co-dependencies between the new character-level embeddings. The module serves as a ``soft`` letter-to-sound layer, converting Romanian text into a continuous representation that the F5-TTS model uses to produce naturally sounding Romanian utterances. We evaluate the model with a pool of 20 human listeners across three tasks: (a) audio similarity between reference and generated speech, (b) pronunciation and naturalness and (c) Romanian-English code-switching.

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning."}

However, we argue that existing methods are limited since the label consistency is not guaranteed during demonstration selection. Our cognition derives from the Bayesian view of ICL and our rethinking of ICL from the transductive label propagation perspective. We treat ICL as a transductive learning method and incorporate latent concepts from Bayesian view and deduce that similar demonstrations guide the concepts of query, with consistent labels serving as estimates. Based on this understanding, we establish a label propagation framework to link label consistency with propagation error bounds. To model label consistency, we propose a data synthesis method, leveraging both semantic and label information, and use TopK sampling with Synthetic Data (TopK-SD) to acquire demonstrations with consistent labels. TopK-SD outperforms original TopK sampling on multiple benchmarks. Our work provides a new perspective for understanding the working mechanisms within ICL."}

Among vulnerable road users, bicyclists present unique characteristics that make their safety both critical and also manageable. Vehicles often travel at significantly higher relative speeds when interacting with bicyclists as compared to their interactions with pedestrians which makes collision avoidance system design for bicyclist safety more challenging. Yet, bicyclist movements are generally more predictable and governed by clear traffic rules as compared to the sudden and sometimes erratic pedestrian motion, offering opportunities for model-based control strategies. To address bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments, this study proposes and develops a High Order Control Lyapunov Function High Order Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programming (HOCLF HOCBF QP) control framework. Through this framework, CLFs constraints guarantee system stability so that the vehicle can track its reference trajectory, whereas CBFs constraints ensure system safety by letting vehicle avoiding potential collisions region with surrounding obstacles. Then by solving a QP problem, an optimal control command that simultaneously satisfies stability and safety requirements can be calculated. Three key bicyclist crash scenarios recorded in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) are recreated and used to comprehensively evaluate the proposed autonomous driving bicyclist safety control strategy in a simulation study. Simulation results demonstrate that the HOCLF HOCBF QP controller can help the vehicle perform robust, and collision-free maneuvers, highlighting its potential for improving bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments."}

In Houston, Texas, on-road transportation represents 48% of baseline emissions in the Climate Action Plan (CAP). To reach net-zero by 2050, the CAP targets a 70% emissions reduction from a 2014 baseline, offset by 30% renewable energy. This goal is challenging because Houston is low-density and auto-dependent, with 89% of on-road emissions from cars and small trucks and limited public transit usage. Socio-economic disparities further constrain Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) adoption. Strategies focus on expanding ZEV access and reducing Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by 20% through transit improvements and city design. This paper presents methods for establishing an on-road emissions baseline and evaluating policies that leverage socio-economic indicators and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to accelerate ZEV adoption and reduce VMT. Smart parking, transit incentives, secure data systems, and ZEV fleet management support improvements in modal split and system reliability.

When the data is drawn from an isotropic Gaussian mixture distribution, it is known that the evolution of a finite family of summary statistics under stochastic gradient descent converges to an autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE), as the dimension and sample size go to $\\infty$ and the step size goes to $0$ commensurately. Our main result is that these ODE limits are universal in that this convergence occurs even when the data is drawn from mixtures of product measures provided the first two moments match the corresponding Gaussian distribution and the initialization and ground truth vectors are sufficiently coordinate-delocalized. We complement this by proving two corresponding non-universality results. We provide a simple example where the ODE limits are non-universal if the initialization is coordinate aligned.

Simulation results indicate a potential reduction in range anxiety and an increase in battery lifespan due to frequent shallow charging cycles.

Experimental results demonstrate that SCIR outperforms state-of-the-art IE methods across three key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction, achieving a 5.27 percent average improvement in span-based Micro-F1 while reducing training costs by 87 percent compared to baseline approaches. These advancements not only enhance the flexibility and accuracy of IE systems but also pave the way for lightweight and efficient IE paradigms."}

Using a standard Hugging Face setup with DialoGPT-medium (a 345M parameter GPT-2 style decoder trained on 147M Reddit exchanges, 2005 to 2017) as the testbed, we build a cache of past activations and get entries by sentence embeddings, then reuse cached past key values when the cached prompt is an exact prefix of the new input. We compare recycled vs. baseline runs on latency and output fidelity, and log reuse depth in tokens. Reproducibility requires no model modifications, cached KVs are serialized to the CPU, reloaded, and supplied to the generate function to continue decoding from the cached prefix. In tests, we observe consistent speedups when prefix overlap exists, with no material degradation in output semantics, and when overlap is absent, behavior matches baseline."}

The current solutions mainly rely on infrastructure-based systems, which limit their ability to navigate safely in dynamic environments. We propose a novel navigation approach that utilizes a foundation model to transform floor plans into navigable knowledge graphs and generate human-readable navigation instructions. Floorplan2Guide integrates a large language model (LLM) to extract spatial information from architectural layouts, reducing the manual preprocessing required by earlier floorplan parsing methods. Experimental results indicate that few-shot learning improves navigation accuracy in comparison to zero-shot learning on simulated and real-world evaluations. Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieves the highest accuracy among the evaluated models, with 92.31%, 76.92%, and 61.54% on the short, medium, and long routes, respectively, under 5-shot prompting of the MP-1 floor plan. The success rate of graph-based spatial structure is 15.4% higher than that of direct visual reasoning among all models, which confirms that graphical representation and in-context learning enhance navigation performance and make our solution more precise for indoor navigation of Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users."}

Recent large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as decision-support components in such systems, yet most deployments focus on textual inputs and do not directly address rule-grounded reasoning over numeric measurements. This paper proposes a rule-aware prompt framework that systematically encodes CPS domain context, numeric normalization, and decision rules into a modular prompt architecture for LLMs. The framework decomposes prompts into five reusable modules, including role specification, CPS domain context, numeric normalization, rule-aware reasoning, and output schema, and exposes an interface for plugging in diverse rule sets. A key design element is separating rule specification from the representation of normalized numeric deviations, which enables concise prompts that remain aligned with domain rules. We analyze how different normalization strategies and prompt configurations influence rule adherence, interpretability, and token efficiency. The framework is model-agnostic and applicable across CPS domains. To illustrate its behavior, we instantiate it on numeric anomaly assessment in an IEEE 118-bus electric power transmission network and evaluate several prompting and adaptation regimes. The results show that rule-aware, z-score-based value blocks and a hybrid LLM-detector architecture can substantially improve consistency with CPS rules and anomaly detection performance while reducing token usage, providing a reusable bridge between numeric telemetry and general-purpose LLMs."}

Building on the narrative policy framework and existing research on authoritarian propaganda, we propose two dimensions that shape narrative construction: legitimacy implications -- whether events enhance or threaten regime legitimacy, and citizen verification capacity -- the extent to which citizens can evaluate official narratives through alternative sources. Using quantitative narrative analysis of Chinese social media posts by government, state media, and celebrity accounts, we extract subject-verb-object (SVO) triplets to map dominant narrative structures across four major events. Our findings show that legitimacy implications of the event shape regime's efforts in storytelling and the beliefs highlighted in the narratives, while citizen's verification capacity could balance the strategic choice between a top-down manipulation and bottom-up responsiveness of state narratives. Together, the results reveal propaganda as a complex process of narrative construction adaptive to specific contexts, offering new insights into how dynamic storytelling sustains authoritarian resilience."}

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control. Overall, reusable value profiles provide a tractable computational account of belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments and yield testable signatures of belief-dependent control and behavioral flexibility."}

Recently, a new class of stochastic momentum algorithms has emerged within the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework--leading to state-of-the-art methods, such as Muon, Scion, and Gluon, that effectively solve deep neural network training problems. However, traditional stochastic momentum methods offer convergence guarantees no better than the ${O}(1/K^{1/4})$ rate. While several approaches--such as Hessian-Corrected Momentum (HCM)--have aimed to improve this rate, their theoretical results are generally restricted to the Euclidean norm setting. This limitation hinders their applicability in problems, where arbitrary norms are often required. In this paper, we extend the LMO-based framework by integrating HCM, and provide convergence guarantees under relaxed smoothness and arbitrary norm settings. We establish improved convergence rates of ${O}(1/K^{1/3})$ for HCM, which can adapt to the geometry of the problem and achieve a faster rate than traditional momentum. Experimental results on training Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks verify our theoretical observations."}

To address this, this paper proposes an end-to-end decision-focused framework that jointly optimizes probabilistic forecasting and robust operation for microgrids. A multilayer encoder-decoder (MED) probabilistic forecasting model is integrated with a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model involving direct load control (DLC) through a differentiable decision pathway, enabling gradient-based feedback from operational outcomes to improve forecasting performance. Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations. The results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the end-to-end decision-focused approach for resilient and cost-efficient microgrid management under uncertainty."}

In psycholinguistics, LLMs have been recently employed in automatically augmenting human-rated datasets, with promising results obtained by generating ratings for single words. Yet, performance for ratings of complex items, i.e., metaphors, is still unexplored. Here, we present the first assessment of the validity and reliability of ratings of metaphors on familiarity, comprehensibility, and imageability, generated by three GPT models for a total of 687 items gathered from the Italian Figurative Archive and three English studies. We performed a thorough validation in terms of both alignment with human data and ability to predict behavioral and electrophysiological responses. We found that machine-generated ratings positively correlated with human-generated ones. Familiarity ratings reached moderate-to-strong correlations for both English and Italian metaphors, although correlations weakened for metaphors with high sensorimotor load. Imageability showed moderate correlations in English and moderate-to-strong in Italian. Comprehensibility for English metaphors exhibited the strongest correlations. Overall, larger models outperformed smaller ones and greater human-model misalignment emerged with familiarity and imageability. Machine-generated ratings significantly predicted response times and the EEG amplitude, with a strength comparable to human ratings. Moreover, GPT ratings obtained across independent sessions were highly stable. We conclude that GPT, especially larger models, can validly and reliably replace - or augment - human subjects in rating metaphor properties. Yet, LLMs align worse with humans when dealing with conventionality and multimodal aspects of metaphorical meaning, calling for careful consideration of the nature of stimuli."}

This study leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to automate actuator settings for optimal greenhouse management. To enhance interpretability and trust in the model decision-making process, both local and global explanation techniques were employed using model-inherent interpretation, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley additive explanations (SHAP). These explainability methods provide information on how different sensor readings, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, light, and outer climate, contribute to actuator control decisions in an automated greenhouse. The trained TFT model achieved a test accuracy of 95% on a class-imbalanced dataset for actuator control settings in an automated greenhouse environment. The results demonstrate the varying influence of each sensor on real-time greenhouse adjustments, ensuring transparency and enabling adaptive fine-tuning for improved crop yield and resource efficiency."}

First, a dynamic Thevenin equivalent model is integrated within smart meters (SM), enabling local voltage magnitude estimation using local SM data for RL agent training, and mitigating the dependency of synchronised data collection and centralised PF calculations. To mitigate estimation errors induced by Thevenin model inaccuracies, a voltage magnitude correction strategy that combines piecewise functions and neural networks is introduced. The piecewise function corrects the large errors of estimated voltage magnitude, while a neural network mimics the grid's sensitivity to control actions, improving action adjustment precision. Second, a coordination strategy is proposed to refine local RL agent actions online, preventing voltage magnitude violations induced by excessive actions from multiple independently trained agents. Case studies on energy storage systems validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its potential to improve voltage regulation in distribution networks."}

We are proposing a Technical Policy Blueprint that encodes governance requirements as policy-as-code objects and separates asset policy verification from asset policy enforcement. In this architecture the Policy Engine verifies evidence (e.g., identities, signatures, payments, trusted-hardware attestations) and issues capability packages. Asset Guardians (e.g. data guardians, model guardians, computation guardians, etc.) enforce access or execution solely based on these capability packages. This core concept of decoupling policy processing from capabilities enables governance to evolve without reconfiguring AI infrastructure, thus creating an approach that is transparent, auditable, and resilient to change."}

Classical SSP formulations rely on sum-aggregated costs, which are suitable for cumulative quantities such as time or energy but fail to capture bottleneck-style objectives such as avoiding high-risk transitions, where performance is determined by the worst single event along a trajectory. Such objectives are particularly important in safety-critical systems, where even one hazardous transition can be unacceptable. To address this limitation, we introduce max-aggregated objectives that minimize the bottleneck cost, i.e., the maximum one-step cost along a trajectory. We show that standard Bellman equations on the original state space do not apply in this setting and propose an augmented MDP with a state variable tracking the running maximum cost, together with a value iteration algorithm. We further identify a cyclic policy phenomenon, where zero-marginal-cost cycles prevent goal reaching under max-aggregation, and resolve it via a finite-horizon formulation. To handle richer task requirements, linear temporal logic specifications are translated into deterministic finite automata and combined with the system to construct a product MDP. We propose a lexicographic value iteration algorithm that handles mixed max-sum objectives under lexicographic ordering on this product MDP.

We propose a two-stage pipeline suitable for edge deployment: first, a ResNet-based model segments repetitions from the 6-axis IMU data in real-time. Second, features derived from this segmentation, alongside direct convolutional features and historical context captured by an LSTM, are used by a classification model to identify exercise windows corresponding to near-failure states. Using a newly collected dataset from 13 diverse participants performing preacher curls to failure (631 total reps), our segmentation model achieved an F1 score of 0.83, and the near-failure classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.82 under simulated real-time evaluation conditions (1.6 Hz inference rate).

A scalar cognitive potential combines predictive accuracy, structural parsimony, task utility, and normative or logical requirements. Cognition unfolds as the Riemannian gradient flow of this potential, providing a universal dynamical law from which a broad range of psychological phenomena arise. Classical dual-process effects--rapid intuitive responses and slower deliberative reasoning--emerge naturally from metric-induced anisotropies that generate intrinsic time-scale separations and geometric phase transitions, without invoking modular or hybrid architectures. We derive analytical conditions for these regimes and demonstrate their behavioural signatures through simulations of canonical cognitive tasks.

To achieve this, we cast the problem as a Markov decision process adapted for a two-dimensional Ising model with zero-temperature dynamics. Within this framework, we compare alternative growth geometries and identify the structure of optimal strategies across three representative regimes."}

Among vulnerable road users, bicyclists present unique characteristics that make their safety both critical and also manageable. Vehicles often travel at significantly higher relative speeds when interacting with bicyclists as compared to their interactions with pedestrians which makes collision avoidance system design for bicyclist safety more challenging. Yet, bicyclist movements are generally more predictable and governed by clear traffic rules as compared to the sudden and sometimes erratic pedestrian motion, offering opportunities for model-based control strategies. To address bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments, this study proposes and develops a High Order Control Lyapunov Function High Order Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programming (HOCLF HOCBF QP) control framework. Through this framework, CLFs constraints guarantee system stability so that the vehicle can track its reference trajectory, whereas CBFs constraints ensure system safety by letting vehicle avoiding potential collisions region with surrounding obstacles. Then by solving a QP problem, an optimal control command that simultaneously satisfies stability and safety requirements can be calculated. Three key bicyclist crash scenarios recorded in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) are recreated and used to comprehensively evaluate the proposed autonomous driving bicyclist safety control strategy in a simulation study. Simulation results demonstrate that the HOCLF HOCBF QP controller can help the vehicle perform robust, and collision-free maneuvers, highlighting its potential for improving bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments."}

We then use cultural prompting, or using system prompts to shift the cultural alignment of a model to a desired country, to test the adaptability of these models to other cultures, namely China, France, India, Iran, Japan, and the United States. We find that the majority of the eight LLMs tested favor the United States when the culture is not specified, with varying results when prompted for other cultures. When using cultural prompting, seven of the eight models shifted closer to the expected culture. We find that models had trouble aligning with Japan and China, despite two of the models tested originating with the Chinese company DeepSeek."}

However, recent work suggests that relying on approximate symmetry can offer greater flexibility and robustness. Despite promising empirical evidence, there has been little theoretical understanding, and in particular, a direct comparison between exact and approximate symmetry is missing from the literature. In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice. Beyond this, our tools and techniques may be of independent interest for the broader study of symmetries in machine learning."}

Supervisory control is a commonly used control method to neutralize attacks on CPS. The supervisor strives to confine the (symbolic) paths of the system to a desired language via sensors and actuators in a closed control loop, even when attackers can manipulate the symbols received by the sensors and actuators. Currently, supervisory control methods face limitations when effectively identifying and mitigating unknown, broad-spectrum attackers. In order to capture the behavior of broad-spectrum attacks on both sensing and actuation channels we model the plant, supervisors, and attackers with finite-state transducers (FSTs). Our general method for addressing unknown attackers involves constructing FST models of the attackers from spectral analysis of their input and output symbol sequences recorded from a history of attack behaviors observed in a supervisory control loop. To construct these FST models, we devise a novel learning method based on the recorded history of attack behaviors. A supervisor is synthesized using such models to neutralize the attacks."}

Recent large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as decision-support components in such systems, yet most deployments focus on textual inputs and do not directly address rule-grounded reasoning over numeric measurements. This paper proposes a rule-aware prompt framework that systematically encodes CPS domain context, numeric normalization, and decision rules into a modular prompt architecture for LLMs. The framework decomposes prompts into five reusable modules, including role specification, CPS domain context, numeric normalization, rule-aware reasoning, and output schema, and exposes an interface for plugging in diverse rule sets. A key design element is separating rule specification from the representation of normalized numeric deviations, which enables concise prompts that remain aligned with domain rules. We analyze how different normalization strategies and prompt configurations influence rule adherence, interpretability, and token efficiency. The framework is model-agnostic and applicable across CPS domains. To illustrate its behavior, we instantiate it on numeric anomaly assessment in an IEEE 118-bus electric power transmission network and evaluate several prompting and adaptation regimes. The results show that rule-aware, z-score-based value blocks and a hybrid LLM-detector architecture can substantially improve consistency with CPS rules and anomaly detection performance while reducing token usage, providing a reusable bridge between numeric telemetry and general-purpose LLMs."}

However, achieving efficient GNN inference on edge devices poses significant challenges, limiting their application in real-world edge scenarios. This is due to the high computational cost of GNNs and limited hardware resources on edge devices, which prevent GNN inference from meeting real-time and energy requirements. As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the integrated co-inference engine in GCoDE enables efficient deployment and execution of GNN co-inference.

We introduce a quantum-aware generative AI framework that systematically addresses this limitation through tight integration of multi-fidelity learning and active validation. Our approach employs a diffusion-based generator conditioned on quantum-mechanical descriptors and a validator using an equivariant neural network potential trained on a hierarchical dataset spanning multiple levels of theory (PBE, SCAN, HSE06, CCSD(T)). Crucially, we implement a robust active learning loop that quantifies and targets the divergence between low- and high-fidelity predictions. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to deconstruct the contribution of each component, perform detailed failure mode analysis, and benchmark our framework against state-of-the-art generative models (CDVAE, GNoME, DiffCSP) across several challenging material classes. Our results demonstrate significant practical gains: a 3-5x improvement in successfully identifying potentially stable candidates in high-divergence regions (e.g., correlated oxides) compared to DFT-only baselines, while maintaining computational feasibility.

Our results show that existing ADS testing techniques struggle to comprehensively evaluate real-world performance, particularly regarding corner case diversity, the simulation to reality gap, the lack of systematic testing criteria, exposure to potential attacks, practical challenges in V2X deployment, and the high computational cost of foundation model-based testing. By further analyzing participant responses together with 105 representative studies, we summarize the current research landscape and highlight major limitations. This study consolidates critical research gaps in ADS testing and outlines key future research directions, including comprehensive testing criteria, cross-model collaboration in V2X systems, cross-modality adaptation for foundation model-based testing, and scalable validation frameworks for large-scale ADS evaluation."}

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices. The results show that ICE-based feature importance provides richer insights than the traditional PDP-based approach, while visual interpretations from PDP, ICE, and SHAP complement one another by offering multiple perspectives."}

We also introduce a unified approximate error condition for delayed inexact oracles, which can cover various practical scenarios. Under mild conditions and appropriate parameter updates, we establish both $\\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ non-asymptotic and $o(1/k^2)$ asymptotic convergence rates in expectation for the squared norm of residual. Our rate significantly improves the $\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rates in classical KM-type methods, including their asynchronous variants. We also establish $o(1/k^2)$ almost sure convergence rates and the almost sure convergence of iterates to a solution of the problem. Within our framework, we instantiate three settings for the underlying operator: (i) a deterministic universal delayed oracle; (ii) a stochastic delayed oracle; and (iii) a finite-sum structure with asynchronous updates. For each case, we instantiate our framework to obtain a concrete algorithmic variant for which our convergence results still apply, and whose iteration complexity depends linearly on the maximum delay.

The increase in the gauge factor is attributed to local progressive fiber failure, due to the combination of the thermal residual stress from the printing process and external loading. The coextrusion of conductive filament around the carbon fibers is demonstrated as a means of improving the reliability, noise and electrical connection of the sensors.

Second, we systematically vary the inference prompt and find that introspection is fragile: performance collapses on closely related tasks such as multiple-choice identification of the injected concept or different prompts of binary discrimination of whether a concept was injected at all. Third, we identify a contrasting regime of partial introspection: the same model can reliably classify the strength of the coefficient of a normalized injected concept vector (as weak / moderate / strong / very strong) with up to 70 percent accuracy, far above the 25 percent chance baseline. Together, these results provide more evidence for Anthropic's claim that language models effectively compute a function of their baseline, internal representations during introspection; however, these self-reports about those representations are narrow and prompt-sensitive.

Initially, the discrete switching signal is represented by a set of binary variables, encoding each mode in binary format. An embedded optimal control problem (EOCP) is then formulated by replacing these binary variables with continuous embedded variables that can take intermediate values between zero and one. Although embedding allows SOCPs to be addressed using conventional techniques, the optimal solutions of EOCPs often yield intermediate values for binary variables, which may not be feasible for the original SOCP. To address this challenge, a modified EOCP (MEOCP) is introduced by adding a concave auxiliary cost function of appropriate dimensionality to the main cost function. This addition ensures that the optimal solution of the EOCP is bang-bang, and as a result, feasible for the original SOCP."}

This study examines how automation can improve the techno economic and environmental feasibility of geothermal deployment through three pathways: Enhanced Geothermal Systems in the Dukhan Basin, repurposed oil and gas wells, and ground source heat pumps for district cooling. Using geological datasets and financial modeling, the analysis shows that full automation reduces capital expenditure by 12 to 14 percent and operating expenditure by 14 to 17 percent. The Levelized Cost of Energy decreases from 145 USD per MWh to 125 USD per MWh, and payback periods shorten by up to two years. Environmental results indicate that geothermal substitution can avoid between 4000 and 17600 tons of CO2 per year for each project. Automation also reduces uncertainty in investment outcomes based on Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, the results show that automation strengthens the economic viability of geothermal systems and supports their integration into Qatars long term energy diversification and decarbonization strategies."}

We propose Eikonal-Constrained Quasimetric RL (Eik-QRL), a continuous-time reformulation of QRL based on the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This PDE-based structure makes Eik-QRL trajectory-free, requiring only sampled states and goals, while improving out-of-distribution generalization. We provide theoretical guarantees for Eik-QRL and identify limitations that arise under complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL), which integrates Eik-QRL into a hierarchical decomposition.

The proposed model systematically integrates individual employee efficiency, task complexity, and performance metrics to reflect real organizational dynamics. The formulation is guided by two principal objectives: firstly, to achieve equitable work load distribution commensurate with employee efficiency, and secondly, to minimize overall project costs by accounting for task difficulty and individual proficiency. Furthermore, the approach incorporates adaptive updates to efficiency parameters based on observed performance, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. Empirical evaluation using simulated datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over conventional assignment strategies in terms of both workload fairness and cost reduction. The findings underscore the potential of this MILP based framework as a robust, scalable, and adaptable solution for contemporary human resource allocation challenges in project management contexts."}

Supervisory control is a commonly used control method to neutralize attacks on CPS. The supervisor strives to confine the (symbolic) paths of the system to a desired language via sensors and actuators in a closed control loop, even when attackers can manipulate the symbols received by the sensors and actuators. Currently, supervisory control methods face limitations when effectively identifying and mitigating unknown, broad-spectrum attackers. In order to capture the behavior of broad-spectrum attacks on both sensing and actuation channels we model the plant, supervisors, and attackers with finite-state transducers (FSTs). Our general method for addressing unknown attackers involves constructing FST models of the attackers from spectral analysis of their input and output symbol sequences recorded from a history of attack behaviors observed in a supervisory control loop. To construct these FST models, we devise a novel learning method based on the recorded history of attack behaviors. A supervisor is synthesized using such models to neutralize the attacks."}

Moreover, LLMs rely primarily on implicit parametric memory, which limits their ability to explicitly acquire, recall, and refine methods, causing them to behave predominantly as intuition-driven predictors rather than deliberate, method-oriented learners. Inspired by how humans learn from rare experiences, this paper proposes a human-inspired learning framework that integrates two complementary mechanisms. The first, Obvious Record, explicitly stores cause--result (or question--solution) relationships as symbolic memory, enabling persistent learning even from single or infrequent encounters. The second, Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery, prioritizes and preserves methods with high semantic dissimilarity, allowing the system to capture diverse and underrepresented strategies that are typically overlooked by next-token prediction. Verification on a benchmark of 60 semantically diverse question--solution pairs demonstrates that the proposed entropy-guided approach achieves stronger coverage of unseen questions and significantly greater internal diversity than a random baseline, confirming its effectiveness in discovering more generalizable and human-inspired methods."}

To bridge this critical gap, we propose an information-theoretic optimization framework that allocation of UAVs and multimodal sensors, configures formation geometries, and flight control. The UAV-sensor allocation is optimized by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) determinant maximization. Under this framework we introduce an equivalent formation transition strategy that enhances field-of-view (FOV) coverage without compromising perception accuracy and communication interference.

At the same time, the training and large-scale deployment of AI systems rely on finite and unevenly distributed energy, networking, and computational resources. This tension exposes a largely unexamined problem in current AI governance: while expanding access to AI is essential for social inclusion and equal opportunity, unconstrained growth in AI use risks unsustainable resource consumption, whereas restricting access threatens to entrench inequality and undermine basic rights.\n  This paper argues that access to AI outputs largely derived from publicly produced knowledge should not be treated solely as a commercial service, but as a fundamental civil interest requiring explicit protection. We show that existing regulatory frameworks largely ignore the coupling between equitable access and resource constraints, leaving critical questions of fairness, sustainability, and long-term societal impact unresolved. To address this gap, we propose recognizing access to AI as an \\emph{Intergenerational Civil Right}, establishing a legal and ethical framework that simultaneously safeguards present-day inclusion and the rights of future generations.\n  Beyond normative analysis, we explore how this principle can be technically realized. Drawing on emerging paradigms in IoT--Edge--Cloud computing, decentralized inference, and energy-aware networking, we outline technological trajectories and a strawman architecture for AI Delivery Networks that support equitable access under strict resource constraints.

Sparse KG reasoning, the task of inferring missing knowledge over sparse KGs, is inherently challenging due to the scarcity of knowledge and the difficulty of capturing relational patterns in sparse scenarios.

Existing path-based methods typically rely on computationally intensive random walks to collect paths, producing paths of variable quality. Additionally, these methods fail to leverage the structured nature of graphs by treating paths independently. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Structural and Probabilistic framework named StruProKGR, tailored for efficient and interpretable reasoning on sparse KGs. StruProKGR utilizes a distance-guided path collection mechanism to significantly reduce computational costs while exploring more relevant paths. It further enhances the reasoning process by incorporating structural information through probabilistic path aggregation, which prioritizes paths that reinforce each other.

Moreover, locally-designed frequency support cannot minimize the overall system cost to maintain frequency stability. On the other hand, the concept of frequency-constrained system scheduling is introduced, which incorporates frequency dynamic constraints into the system economic optimization, so that frequency requirements can be maintained with minimum cost. However, these works rely on analytical approximations of the frequency dynamic metrics, which are mathematically complicated and tend to be over-conservative for the approximation of IBR headroom requirements."}

Such models generate multi-step forecasts either directly, by predicting the full horizon at once, or iteratively, by feeding back their own predictions at each step. In both cases, the multi-step forecasts are prone to errors. To address this, we propose a Predictor-Corrector mechanism where the Predictor is any learned time-series model and the Corrector is a neural controlled differential equation. The Predictor forecasts, and the Corrector predicts the errors of the forecasts. Adding these errors to the forecasts improves forecast performance. The proposed Corrector works with irregularly sampled time series and continuous- and discrete-time Predictors. Additionally, we introduce two regularization strategies to improve the extrapolation performance of the Corrector with accelerated training. We evaluate our Corrector with diverse Predictors, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations, Contiformer, and DLinear, on synthetic, physics simulation, and real-world forecasting datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the Predictor-Corrector mechanism consistently improves the performance compared to Predictor alone."}

In contrast with classical null controllability, systems with memory require the simultaneous annihilation of both the state and the accumulated memory at the terminal time in order to prevent post-control reactivation of the dynamics.\n  Assuming that the memory kernel is a finite sum of exponentials, we reformulate the problem as a coupled parabolic--ODE system. Within this framework, we introduce a geometric condition on moving control regions, referred to as the Memory Geometric Control Condition (MGCC), which requires that every spatial point be visited by the control region during the control horizon.\n  Under MGCC, we establish an augmented observability inequality for the adjoint system by means of a flow-adapted Carleman estimate. This observability result, which explicitly accounts for the memory variables, allows us to derive memory-type null controllability via the Hilbert Uniqueness Method. We also discuss the limitations of the approach and explain why full geometric necessity results remain out of reach in the presence of memory effects.\n  The analysis provides a rigorous sufficient geometric condition for memory-type null controllability of parabolic equations with exponential memory kernels and moving controls."}

However, these systems face key challenges, including energy-constrained UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and heterogeneous computing resources. To address these issues, we propose an integrated air-ground collaborative network and formulate a time-dependent integer nonlinear programming problem that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning and task offloading decisions. The problem is challenging to solve due to temporal coupling among decision variables. Therefore, we design a hierarchical learning framework with two timescales. At the large timescale, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism enables the energy-aware and incentive-compatible trajectory assignment. At the small timescale, we propose the diffusion-heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization, a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that embeds latent diffusion models into actor networks. Each UAV samples actions from a Gaussian prior and refines them via observation-conditioned denoising, enhancing adaptability and policy diversity.

Existing methods often rely on pairwise connections, neglecting high-order dependencies among multiple entities and relations, and they treat structural and semantic signals independently, hindering effective cross-modal integration. To address these challenges, we propose MetaHGNIE, a meta-path induced hypergraph contrastive learning framework for disentangling and aligning structural and semantic information. MetaHGNIE constructs a higher-order knowledge graph via meta-path sequences, where typed hyperedges capture multi-entity relational contexts. Structural dependencies are aggregated with local attention, while semantic representations are encoded through a hypergraph transformer equipped with sparse chunking to reduce redundancy. Finally, a multimodal fusion module integrates structural and semantic embeddings under contrastive learning with auxiliary supervision, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment.

If the data were stochastic, then one can show that $E_α$ has probability at least $1-α$ under a wide class of distributions (eg: sub-Gaussian, symmetric, variance-bounded, etc.). In fact, we show that on the Ville event $E_0$ of probability one, the regret on every path in $E_0$ is eventually bounded by $\\ln \\ln V_T$ (up to constants). We explain how this work helps bridge the world of adversarial online learning (which usually deals with regret bounds for bounded data), with game-theoretic statistics (which can handle unbounded data, albeit using stochastic assumptions). In short, conditional regret bounds serve as a bridge between stochastic and adversarial betting."}

There is a large potential to minimize production costs through automated scheduling techniques, due to the large-scale requirements of modern factories. In the past, solution approaches have been studied for many machine scheduling variations, where even basic variants have been shown to be NP-hard. However, in today's real-life production environments, additional complex precedence constraints and resource restrictions with calendars arise that must be fulfilled. These additional constraints cannot be tackled efficiently by existing solution techniques. Thus, there is a strong need to develop and analyze automated methods that can solve such real-life parallel machine scheduling scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel variant of parallel machine scheduling with job precedences and calendar-based cumulative resource constraints that arises in real-life industrial use cases. A constraint modeling approach is proposed as an exact solution method for small scheduling scenarios together with state-of-the-art constraint-solving technology. Further, we propose a construction heuristic as well as a tailored metaheuristic using local search to efficiently tackle large-scale problem instances.

Initially, the discrete switching signal is represented by a set of binary variables, encoding each mode in binary format. An embedded optimal control problem (EOCP) is then formulated by replacing these binary variables with continuous embedded variables that can take intermediate values between zero and one. Although embedding allows SOCPs to be addressed using conventional techniques, the optimal solutions of EOCPs often yield intermediate values for binary variables, which may not be feasible for the original SOCP. To address this challenge, a modified EOCP (MEOCP) is introduced by adding a concave auxiliary cost function of appropriate dimensionality to the main cost function. This addition ensures that the optimal solution of the EOCP is bang-bang, and as a result, feasible for the original SOCP."}

We unify these within a single explanatory framework, the geometry of the loss and error landscapes. We analytically show that phase transitions in DNN learning are governed by saddle points in the loss landscape. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple, fast, and easy to implement algorithm that uses the L2 regularizer as a tool to probe the geometry of error landscapes. We apply it to confirm mode connectivity in DNNs trained on the MNIST dataset by efficiently finding paths that connect global minima.

Existing methods are hindered by three fundamental challenges: the inability to dynamically model latent student cognitive states; severe reward sparsity and delay inherent in long-term educational goals; and a tendency toward policy collapse lacking strategic diversity due to reliance on behavioral cloning. Recognizing the unobservability and dynamic complexity of these interactions, we formalize the Socratic Interdisciplinary Instructional Problem (SIIP) as a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), demanding simultaneous global exploration and fine-grained policy refinement.

Various uncertainty measures have been proposed for this purpose, typically claiming superiority over other measures. In this paper, we argue that there is no single best measure. Instead, uncertainty quantification should be tailored to the specific application. To this end, we use a flexible family of uncertainty measures that distinguishes between total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty of second-order distributions. These measures can be instantiated with specific loss functions, so-called proper scoring rules, to control their characteristics, and we show that different characteristics are useful for different tasks. In particular, we show that, for the task of selective prediction, the scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. On the other hand, for out-of-distribution detection, our results confirm that mutual information, a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, performs best. Furthermore, in an active learning setting, epistemic uncertainty based on zero-one loss is shown to consistently outperform other uncertainty measures."}

In this work, we firstly introduce a comprehensive schema, which contains a hierarchical taxonomy and definitions of arguments, for AI systems to capture legal relations in Chinese civil cases. Based on this schema, we then formulate legal relation extraction task and present LexRel, an expert-annotated benchmark for legal relation extraction in Chinese civil law. We use LexRel to evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on legal relation extractions, showing that current LLMs exhibit significant limitations in accurately identifying civil legal relations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating legal relations information leads to consistent performance gains on other downstream legal AI tasks."}

However, the landscape of AI risk mitigation frameworks is fragmented, uses inconsistent terminology, and has gaps in coverage. This paper introduces a preliminary AI Risk Mitigation Taxonomy to organize AI risk mitigations and provide a common frame of reference. The Taxonomy was developed through a rapid evidence scan of 13 AI risk mitigation frameworks published between 2023-2025, which were extracted into a living database of 831 AI risk mitigations. The mitigations were iteratively clustered & coded to create the Taxonomy. The preliminary AI Risk Mitigation Taxonomy organizes mitigations into four categories and 23 subcategories: (1) Governance & Oversight: Formal organizational structures and policy frameworks that establish human oversight mechanisms and decision protocols; (2) Technical & Security: Technical, physical, and engineering safeguards that secure AI systems and constrain model behaviors; (3) Operational Process: processes and management frameworks governing AI system deployment, usage, monitoring, incident handling, and validation; and (4) Transparency & Accountability: formal disclosure practices and verification mechanisms that communicate AI system information and enable external scrutiny. The rapid evidence scan and taxonomy construction also revealed several cases where terms like 'risk management' and 'red teaming' are used widely but refer to different responsible actors, actions, and mechanisms of action to reduce risk. This Taxonomy and associated mitigation database, while preliminary, offers a starting point for collation and synthesis of AI risk mitigations. It also offers an accessible, structured way for different actors in the AI ecosystem to discuss and coordinate action to reduce risks from AI."}

By feasible-set reshaping, we project the constraints of the original feasible set onto an appropriately chosen constant matrix with its rows forming a positive span of the space of the optimization variable.

Moreover, locally-designed frequency support cannot minimize the overall system cost to maintain frequency stability. On the other hand, the concept of frequency-constrained system scheduling is introduced, which incorporates frequency dynamic constraints into the system economic optimization, so that frequency requirements can be maintained with minimum cost. However, these works rely on analytical approximations of the frequency dynamic metrics, which are mathematically complicated and tend to be over-conservative for the approximation of IBR headroom requirements."}

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices. The results show that ICE-based feature importance provides richer insights than the traditional PDP-based approach, while visual interpretations from PDP, ICE, and SHAP complement one another by offering multiple perspectives."}

Although this model has been widely used to make predictions in behavioral ecology, discovering the computational mechanisms that facilitate the emergence of optimal patch-foraging decisions in biological foragers remains under investigation. Here, we show that artificial foragers equipped with learned world models naturally converge to MVT-aligned strategies. Using a model-based reinforcement learning agent that acquires a parsimonious predictive representation of its environment, we demonstrate that anticipatory capabilities, rather than reward maximization alone, drive efficient patch-leaving behavior. Compared with standard model-free RL agents, these model-based agents exhibit decision patterns similar to many of their biological counterparts, suggesting that predictive world models can serve as a foundation for more explainable and biologically grounded decision-making in AI systems.

Among these, stealthy attacks, those that evade conventional detection mechanisms, pose a critical threat to closed-loop performance. This paper introduces a controller-oriented method to enhance CPS resiliency against such attacks without compromising nominal closed-loop behavior. Specifically, we propose the concept of plant equivalent controller (PEC) realizations, representing a class of dynamic output-feedback controllers that preserve the input-output behavior of a given base controller while exhibiting distinct robustness properties in the presence of disturbances and sensor attacks. To quantify and improve robustness, we employ reachable set analysis to assess the impact of stealthy attacks on the closed-loop dynamics. Building on this analysis, we provide mathematical tools (in terms of linear matrix inequalities) to synthesize the optimal PEC realization that minimizes the reachable set under peak-bounded disturbances. The proposed framework thus provides systematic analysis and synthesis tools to enhance the attack resilience of CPSs while maintaining the desired nominal performance. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on the quadruple-tank process subject to stealthy sensor attacks."}

Current model-risk frameworks assume static, well-specified algorithms and one-time validations; large language models and multi-agent trading systems violate those assumptions by learning continuously, exchanging latent signals, and exhibiting emergent behavior. Drawing on complex adaptive systems theory, we model these technologies as decentralized ensembles whose risks propagate along multiple time-scales. We then propose a modular governance architecture. The framework decomposes oversight into four layers of \"regulatory blocks\": (i) self-regulation modules embedded beside each model, (ii) firm-level governance blocks that aggregate local telemetry and enforce policy, (iii) regulator-hosted agents that monitor sector-wide indicators for collusive or destabilizing patterns, and (iv) independent audit blocks that supply third-party assurance. Eight design strategies enable the blocks to evolve as fast as the models they police. A case study on emergent spoofing in multi-agent trading shows how the layered controls quarantine harmful behavior in real time while preserving innovation. The architecture remains compatible with today's model-risk rules yet closes critical observability and control gaps, providing a practical path toward resilient, adaptive AI governance in financial systems."}

In the standard setting, the optimal mistake bound is characterized by the Littlestone dimension $d$ of the concept class $H$ (Littlestone 1987). We prove that in the transductive setting, the mistake bound is at least $Ω(\\sqrt{d})$. This constitutes an exponential improvement over previous lower bounds of $Ω(\\log\\log d)$, $Ω(\\sqrt{\\log d})$, and $Ω(\\log d)$, due respectively to Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1995, 1997) and Hanneke, Moran, and Shafer (2023). We also show that this lower bound is tight: for every $d$, there exists a class of Littlestone dimension $d$ with transductive mistake bound $O(\\sqrt{d})$. Our upper bound also improves upon the best known upper bound of $(2/3)d$ from Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1997). These results establish a quadratic gap between transductive and standard online learning, thereby highlighting the benefit of advance access to the unlabeled instance sequence.

A lightweight lambda-curriculum is adopted to stabilize training as the state expands from a risk-neutral reduced HJB to a risk-averse HJB. On the Gatheral-Schied single-asset model, MT-PINN aligns closely with their derived closed-form solutions and concentrates terminal inventory tightly around zero while reducing errors along optimal paths. We apply MT-PINNs on SPY intraday data, matching TWAP when risk-neutral, and achieving lower exposure and competitive costs, especially in falling windows, for higher risk-aversion."}

Two approaches are investigated: (1) attaching a classification head to a pre-trained causal LLM and fine-tuning on the task (using the LLM's final token embedding as a sequence representation), and (2) instruction-tuning the LLM in a prompt->response format for classification. To enable single-GPU fine-tuning of models up to 8B parameters, we combine 4-bit model quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient training. Experiments on two datasets - a proprietary single-label dataset and the public WIPO-Alpha patent dataset (extreme multi-label classification) - show that the embedding-based method significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned method in F1-score, and is very competitive with - even surpassing - fine-tuned domain-specific models (e.g. BERT) on the same tasks.

However, its worst-case robustness under a misalignment threat model--where a model might learn to actively conceal its internal states--remains untested. Focusing on this threat model, we ask: could a model learn to evade previously unseen activation monitors? Our core contribution is to stress-test the learnability of this behavior. We demonstrate that finetuning can create Neural Chameleons: models capable of zero-shot evading activation monitors. Specifically, we fine-tune an LLM to evade monitors for a set of benign concepts (e.g., languages, HTML) when conditioned on a trigger of the form: \"You are being probed for {concept}\". We show that this learned mechanism generalizes zero-shot: by substituting {concept} with a safety-relevant term like 'deception', the model successfully evades previously unseen safety monitors. We validate this phenomenon across diverse model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), showing that the evasion succeeds even against monitors trained post hoc on the model's frozen weights. This evasion is highly selective, targeting only the specific concept mentioned in the trigger, and having a modest impact on model capabilities on standard benchmarks. Using Gemma-2-9b-it as a case study, a mechanistic analysis reveals this is achieved via a targeted manipulation that moves activations into a low-dimensional subspace. While stronger defenses like monitor ensembles and non-linear classifiers show greater resilience, the model retains a non-trivial evasion capability. Our work provides a proof-of-concept for this failure mode and a tool to evaluate the worst-case robustness of monitoring techniques against misalignment threat models."}

This is particularly critical in high-stakes operational contexts like supply chain management. To address this, we investigate the decision-making patterns of leading LLMs using the canonical newsvendor problem in a dynamic setting, aiming to identify the nature and origins of their cognitive biases. Methodology/results: Through dynamic, multi-round experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-8B, we tested for five established decision biases. We found that LLMs consistently replicated the classic ``Too Low/Too High'' ordering bias and significantly amplified other tendencies like demand-chasing behavior compared to human benchmarks. Our analysis uncovered a ``paradox of intelligence'': the more sophisticated GPT-4 demonstrated the greatest irrationality through overthinking, while the efficiency-optimized GPT-4o performed near-optimally. Because these biases persist even when optimal formulas are provided, we conclude they stem from architectural constraints rather than knowledge gaps. Managerial implications: First, managers should select models based on the specific task, as our results show that efficiency-optimized models can outperform more complex ones on certain optimization problems. Second, the significant amplification of bias by LLMs highlights the urgent need for robust human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes decisions to prevent costly errors. Third, our findings suggest that designing structured, rule-based prompts is a practical and effective strategy for managers to constrain models' heuristic tendencies and improve the reliability of AI-assisted decisions."}

Results indicate predominantly positive sentiments, with homework apps like Edu AI (95.9% positive) and Answer.AI (92.7%) leading in accuracy, speed, and personalization, while language/LMS apps (e.g., Teacher AI at 21.8% positive) lag due to instability and limited features. Positives emphasize efficiency in brainstorming, problem-solving, and engagement; negatives center on paywalls, inaccuracies, ads, and glitches. Trends show that homework helpers outperform specialized tools, highlighting AI's democratizing potential amid risks of dependency and inequity. The discussion proposes future ecosystems with hybrid AI-human models, VR/AR for immersive learning, and a roadmap for developers (adaptive personalization) and policymakers (monetization regulation for inclusivity). This underscores generative AI's role in advancing e-teaching by enabling ethical refinements that foster equitable, innovative environments.

First, they rely on global strong convexity assumptions which are often not satisfied in practice. Second, the resulting bounds scale very poorly with the number of parameters ($d$) and the number of samples removed ($k$). As a result, these analyses are not tight enough to answer fundamental questions such as \"what is the asymptotic scaling of the errors of each method?\" or \"which of these methods is more accurate for a given dataset?\"\n  In this paper, we introduce a new analysis of the NS and IF data attribution methods for convex learning problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of these questions that does not assume global strong convexity and also the first explanation of [KATL19] and [RH25a]'s observation that NS data attribution is often more accurate than IF. We prove that for sufficiently well-behaved logistic regression, our bounds are asymptotically tight up to poly-logarithmic factors, yielding scaling laws for the errors in the average-case sample removals.\n  \\[ \\mathbb{E}_{T \\subseteq [n],\\, |T| = k} \\bigl[ \\|\\hatθ_T - \\hatθ_T^{\\mathrm{NS}}\\|_2 \\bigr] = \\widetildeΘ\\!\\left(\\frac{k d}{n^2}\\right), \\qquad \\mathbb{E}_{T \\subseteq [n],\\, |T| = k} \\bigl[ \\|\\hatθ_T^{\\mathrm{NS}} - \\hatθ_T^{\\mathrm{IF}}\\|_2 \\bigr] = \\widetildeΘ\\!\\left( \\frac{(k + d)\\sqrt{k d}}{n^2} \\right). \\]"}

AL provides a framework that helps practitioners query informative samples for annotation by oracles (labelers). However, these labels often contain noise due to varying levels of labeler accuracy. Additionally, uncertain samples are more prone to receiving incorrect labels because of their complexity. Learning from imperfectly labeled data leads to an inaccurate classifier. We propose a novel AL framework to construct a robust classification model by minimizing noise levels. Our approach includes an assignment model that optimally assigns query points to labelers, aiming to minimize the maximum possible noise within each cycle. Additionally, we introduce a new sampling method to identify the best query points, reducing the impact of label noise on classifier performance. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance compared to several benchmark methods."}

However, their performance is often crippled by \"Context Explosion\", where the accumulation of long text outputs overwhelms the model's context window and leads to reasoning failures. To address this, we introduce CoDA, a Context-Decoupled hierarchical Agent, a simple but effective reinforcement learning framework that decouples high-level planning from low-level execution. It employs a single, shared LLM backbone that learns to operate in two distinct, contextually isolated roles: a high-level Planner that decomposes tasks within a concise strategic context, and a low-level Executor that handles tool interactions in an ephemeral, isolated workspace. We train this unified agent end-to-end using PECO (Planner-Executor Co-Optimization), a reinforcement learning methodology that applies a trajectory-level reward to jointly optimize both roles, fostering seamless collaboration through context-dependent policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, and it exhibits strong robustness in long-context scenarios, maintaining stable performance while all other baselines suffer severe degradation, thus further validating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design in mitigating context overload."}

Misinterpreting intent or risks may lead to unsafe outputs, while overly cautious interpretations can cause unnecessary refusal of benign requests. In this paper, we question the conventional framework in which LLMs generate immediate responses to requests without considering broader contextual factors. User requests are situated within broader contexts such as intentions, knowledge, and prior experience, which strongly influence what constitutes an appropriate answer. We propose a framework that extracts and leverages such contextual information from the user prompt itself. Specifically, a reinforcement learning based context generator, designed in an autoencoder-like fashion, is trained to infer contextual signals grounded in the prompt and use them to guide response generation. This approach is particularly important for safety tasks, where ambiguous requests may bypass safeguards while benign but confusing requests can trigger unnecessary refusals. Experiments show that our method reduces harmful responses by an average of 5.6% on the SafetyInstruct dataset across multiple foundation models and improves the harmonic mean of attack success rate and compliance on benign prompts by 6.2% on XSTest and WildJailbreak. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of context extraction for safer and more reliable LLM inferences."}

In this work, we propose two neural network (NN) models DFT-Net and Demodulation-Net (Demod-Net) to jointly replace the IDFT/DFT and demodulation modules in an OFDM transceiver.

Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches. This approach holds promise for improving the performance and robustness of brain-computer interfaces over time and for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of behavior."}

Initially, the discrete switching signal is represented by a set of binary variables, encoding each mode in binary format. An embedded optimal control problem (EOCP) is then formulated by replacing these binary variables with continuous embedded variables that can take intermediate values between zero and one. Although embedding allows SOCPs to be addressed using conventional techniques, the optimal solutions of EOCPs often yield intermediate values for binary variables, which may not be feasible for the original SOCP. To address this challenge, a modified EOCP (MEOCP) is introduced by adding a concave auxiliary cost function of appropriate dimensionality to the main cost function. This addition ensures that the optimal solution of the EOCP is bang-bang, and as a result, feasible for the original SOCP."}

To address this gap, we present NL2Repo Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the long-horizon repository generation ability of coding agents. Given only a single natural-language requirements document and an empty workspace, agents must autonomously design the architecture, manage dependencies, implement multi-module logic, and produce a fully installable Python library. Our experiments across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models reveal that long-horizon repository generation remains largely unsolved: even the strongest agents achieve below 40% average test pass rates and rarely complete an entire repository correctly. Detailed analysis uncovers fundamental long-horizon failure modes, including premature termination, loss of global coherence, fragile cross-file dependencies, and inadequate planning over hundreds of interaction steps.

Second, existing benchmarks treat agents as monolithic black boxes, overlooking the contributions of individual components, which often leads to unfair comparisons or obscures key performance bottlenecks.

Validating five market microstructure patterns across 100 US equities from 2015 to 2024, the system yields modest annualized returns (0.55%, Sharpe ratio 0.33) with exceptional downside protection (maximum drawdown -2.76%) and market-neutral characteristics (beta = 0.058).

Among these, stealthy attacks, those that evade conventional detection mechanisms, pose a critical threat to closed-loop performance. This paper introduces a controller-oriented method to enhance CPS resiliency against such attacks without compromising nominal closed-loop behavior. Specifically, we propose the concept of plant equivalent controller (PEC) realizations, representing a class of dynamic output-feedback controllers that preserve the input-output behavior of a given base controller while exhibiting distinct robustness properties in the presence of disturbances and sensor attacks. To quantify and improve robustness, we employ reachable set analysis to assess the impact of stealthy attacks on the closed-loop dynamics. Building on this analysis, we provide mathematical tools (in terms of linear matrix inequalities) to synthesize the optimal PEC realization that minimizes the reachable set under peak-bounded disturbances. The proposed framework thus provides systematic analysis and synthesis tools to enhance the attack resilience of CPSs while maintaining the desired nominal performance. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on the quadruple-tank process subject to stealthy sensor attacks."}

We introduce and test the Ideological Turing Test, a gamified framework requiring participants to adopt and defend opposing viewpoints, to reduce affective animosity and affective polarization.\n  We conducted a mixed-design experiment ($N = 203$) with four conditions: modality (debate/writing) x perspective-taking (Own/Opposite side). Participants engaged in structured interactions defending assigned positions, with outcomes judged by peers. We measured changes in affective animosity and ideological position immediately post-intervention and at 2-6 week follow-up.\n  Perspective-taking reduced out-group animosity and ideological polarization. However, effects differed by modality (writing vs. debate) and over time. For affective animosity, writing from the opposite perspective yielded the largest immediate reduction ($Δ=+0.45$ SD), but the effect was not detectable at the 4-6 week follow-up. In contrast, the debate modality maintained a statistically significant reduction in animosity immediately after and at follow-up ($Δ=+0.37$ SD). For ideological position, adopting the opposite perspective led to significant immediate movement across modalities (writing: $Δ=+0.91$ SD; debate: $Δ=+0.51$ SD), and these changes persisted at follow-up. Judged performance (winning) did not moderate these effects, and willingness to re-participate was similar across conditions (~20-36%).\n  These findings challenge assumptions about adversarial methods, revealing distinct temporal patterns: non-adversarial engagement fosters short-term empathy gains, while cognitive engagement through debate sustains affective benefits. The Ideological Turing Test demonstrates potential as a scalable tool for reducing polarization, particularly when combining perspective-taking with reflective adversarial interactions."}

We present a diagnostic study using the Amazon Computers co-purchase data to understand when and why GCNs help. Through systematic experiments with simulated label scarcity, feature ablation, and per-class analysis, we find that GCN performance depends critically on the interaction between graph homophily and feature quality. GCNs provide the largest gains under extreme label scarcity, where they leverage neighborhood structure to compensate for limited supervision. Surprisingly, GCNs can match their original performance even when node features are replaced with random noise, suggesting that structure alone carries sufficient signal on highly homophilous graphs. However, GCNs hurt performance when homophily is low and features are already strong, as noisy neighbors corrupt good predictions. Our quadrant analysis reveals that GCNs help in three of four conditions and only hurt when low homophily meets strong features. These findings offer practical guidance for practitioners deciding whether to adopt graph-based methods."}

We then investigate the effects of dialogue length on persona fidelity, instruction-following, and safety of seven state-of-the-art open- and closed-weight LLMs. We find that persona fidelity degrades over the course of dialogues, especially in goal-oriented conversations, where models must sustain both persona fidelity and instruction following. We identify a trade-off between fidelity and instruction following, with non-persona baselines initially outperforming persona-assigned models; as dialogues progress and fidelity fades, persona responses become increasingly similar to baseline responses. Our findings highlight the fragility of persona applications in extended interactions and our work provides a protocol to systematically measure such failures."}

We propose Eikonal-Constrained Quasimetric RL (Eik-QRL), a continuous-time reformulation of QRL based on the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This PDE-based structure makes Eik-QRL trajectory-free, requiring only sampled states and goals, while improving out-of-distribution generalization. We provide theoretical guarantees for Eik-QRL and identify limitations that arise under complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL), which integrates Eik-QRL into a hierarchical decomposition.

This reliance adds engineering complexity and hyperparameter tuning, while also lacking a direct data-driven gradient signal, which might result in sub-optimal compression. In this paper, we introduce CoDeQ, a simple, fully differentiable method for joint pruning--quantization. Our approach builds on a key observation: the dead-zone of a scalar quantizer is equivalent to magnitude pruning, and can be used to induce sparsity directly within the quantization operator. Concretely, we parameterize the dead-zone width and learn it via backpropagation, alongside the quantization parameters. This design provides explicit control of sparsity, regularized by a single global hyperparameter, while decoupling sparsity selection from bit-width selection. The result is a method for Compression with Dead-zone Quantizer (CoDeQ) that supports both fixed-precision and mixed-precision quantization (controlled by an optional second hyperparameter). It simultaneously determines the sparsity pattern and quantization parameters in a single end-to-end optimization. Consequently, CoDeQ does not require any auxiliary procedures, making the method architecture-agnostic and straightforward to implement. On ImageNet with ResNet-18, CoDeQ reduces bit operations to ~5% while maintaining close to full precision accuracy in both fixed and mixed-precision regimes."}

In this work, we propose two neural network (NN) models DFT-Net and Demodulation-Net (Demod-Net) to jointly replace the IDFT/DFT and demodulation modules in an OFDM transceiver. The models are trained end-to-end (E2E) to minimize bit error rate (BER) while preserving operator equivalence for hybrid deployment. A customized DFT-Demodulation Net Accelerator (DDNA) is further developed to efficiently map the proposed networks onto field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms. Leveraging fine-grained pipelining and block matrix operations, DDNA achieves high throughput and flexibility under stringent latency constraints.

To address this gap between appearance and function, we introduce the State over Tokens (SoT) conceptual framework. SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles. This explains how the tokens can drive correct reasoning without being a faithful explanation when read as text and surfaces previously overlooked research questions on these tokens. We argue that to truly understand the process that LLMs do, research must move beyond reading the reasoning tokens as text and focus on decoding them as state."}

Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 44.71, p < 0.001), with mean SSI dropping from 0.951 at temperature 0.0 to 0.896 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62). These findings demonstrate that single-shot safety evaluations are insufficient for reliable safety assessment.

Project page: https://kagnlp.github.io/WebOperator/", "summary": "LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

Employing a user-centred, mixed-methods design process, we co-developed an AI chatbot with lecturers to address recurring instructional challenges during exam preparation, specifically managing repetitive questions and scaling feedback delivery. The POC achieved its primary operational goals: lecturers reported streamlined workflows, reduced cognitive load, and observed improved student confidence in navigating course content. However, the deployment yielded unexpected insights into student learning behaviours. Despite enhanced teaching processes, performance data revealed no significant improvement in overall student assessment outcomes. Deep analysis of interaction logs identified concerning patterns, including self-efficacy-driven dependency, \"metacognitive laziness\" (cognitive offloading), and divergent usage strategies. While high-ability students leveraged the tool for strategic verification, low-ability students frequently used it to bypass cognitive effort, potentially exacerbating performance gaps. These findings suggest that Generative AI's educational influence extends beyond instructional efficiency to shape cognitive engagement, self-regulation, and learner equity. The study raises consequential design questions regarding how AI tools can be engineered to minimise dependency, scaffold metacognitive development, and calibrate support across varying ability levels.

The methodology leverages abundant Low-Fidelity (LF) data to learn a compact latent physics representation, which acts as a frozen knowledge base for a decoder that is subsequently fine-tuned using scarce HF samples. Tested on surface-pressure distributions for NACA airfoils (2D) and a transonic wing (3D) databases, the model successfully corrects LF deviations and achieves high-accuracy pressure predictions using minimal HF training data.

In this work, we propose a systematic evaluation framework to examine how interaction tone affects model accuracy and apply it to three recently released and widely available LLMs: GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google DeepMind), and Llama 4 Scout (Meta). Using the MMMLU benchmark, we evaluate model performance under Very Friendly, Neutral, and Very Rude prompt variants across six tasks spanning STEM and Humanities domains, and analyze pairwise accuracy differences with statistical significance testing.\n  Our results show that tone sensitivity is both model-dependent and domain-specific. Neutral or Very Friendly prompts generally yield higher accuracy than Very Rude prompts, but statistically significant effects appear only in a subset of Humanities tasks, where rude tone reduces accuracy for GPT and Llama, while Gemini remains comparatively tone-insensitive. When performance is aggregated across tasks within each domain, tone effects diminish and largely lose statistical significance. Compared with earlier researches, these findings suggest that dataset scale and coverage materially influence the detection of tone effects. Overall, our study indicates that while interaction tone can matter in specific interpretive settings, modern LLMs are broadly robust to tonal variation in typical mixed-domain use, providing practical guidance for prompt design and model selection in real-world deployments."}

To bridge this gap, we propose SMART (Structural Mapping for Augmented Reinforcement Testing), a novel framework that synergizes structural verification and functional validation for game update testing. SMART leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret abstract syntax tree (AST) differences and extract functional intent, constructing a context-aware hybrid reward mechanism. This mechanism guides reinforcement learning agents to sequentially fulfill gameplay goals while adaptively exploring modified code branches. We evaluate SMART on two environments, Overcooked and Minecraft.

I argue these technologies instantiate what I have called the algorithmic condition, whereby computational systems increasingly mediate not just our analytical tools but how we understand nature and society more generally. This article introduces the possibility for new forms of humanistic inquiry through what I term 'AI sprints', as intensive time-boxed research sessions. This is a research method combining the critical reflexivity essential to humanistic inquiry with iterative dialogue with generative AI. Drawing on experimental work in critical code studies, I demonstrate how tight loops of iterative development can adapt data and book sprint methodologies whilst acknowledging the profound transformations generative AI introduces. Through examining the process of human-AI collaboration when undertaken in these intensive research sessions, I seek to outline this approach as a broader research method. The article builds on Rogers' digital methods approach, proposing that we extend methodologies to study digital objects through their native protocols, using AI systems not merely to process digital traces but to analyse materials traditionally requiring manual coding or transcription. I aim to show this by introducing three cognitive modes, cognitive delegation, productive augmentation, and cognitive overhead, explaining how researchers can maintain a strategic overview whilst using LLM capabilities. The paper contributes both a practical methodology for intensive AI-augmented research and a theoretical framework for understanding the epistemological transformations of this hybrid method. A critical methodology must therefore operate in both technical and theoretical registers, sustaining a rigorous ethical-computational engagement with AI systems and outputs."}

We develop an anytime-valid, data-dependent upper confidence sequence for the weighted average suboptimality of projected SGD, constructed via nonnegative supermartingales and requiring no smoothness or strong convexity. This confidence sequence yields a simple stopping rule that is provably $\\varepsilon$-optimal with probability at least $1-α$ and is almost surely finite under standard stochastic approximation stepsizes.

The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions."}

However, existing methods for time series pattern discovery face major challenges, including high computational complexity, limited interpretability, and difficulty in capturing meaningful temporal structures. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel learning framework that jointly trains two Transformer models using complementary time series representations: shapelet-based representations to capture localized temporal structures and traditional feature engineering to encode statistical properties. The learned shapelets serve as interpretable signatures that differentiate time series across classification labels. Additionally, we develop a visual analytics system -- SigTIme -- with coordinated views to facilitate exploration of time series signatures from multiple perspectives, aiding in useful insights generation. We quantitatively evaluate our learning framework on eight publicly available datasets and one proprietary clinical dataset.

We introduce a behaviorally realistic demographic based data augmentation strategy that expands a small QoE dataset six fold by modeling varying user sensitivities to streaming impairments such as rebuffering, bitrate variation, and quality degradation. Using the augmented dataset, we evaluate a comprehensive set of classical machine learning models alongside advanced deep learning architectures, including an attention-based MLP and TabNet.\n  Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy across RMSE, MAE, and R metrics compared to baseline models.

The results confirm that demographic-aware augmentation substantially enhances QoE prediction robustness and provides a scalable direction for personalized QoE-aware intelligence in 5G video streaming networks."}

However, transferring knowledge effectively from one graph to another remains a critical challenge. This highlights the need for algorithms capable of applying information extracted from a source graph to an unlabeled target graph, a task known as unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA). One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains. Guided by the theoretical findings, we propose to improve GDA by decorrelating node features, which can be specifically implemented through decorrelated GCN layers and graph transformer layers. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing not only substantial performance enhancements over baseline GDA methods but also clear visualizations of small intra-class distances in the learned representations.

Recent advances leverage conditional generative models together with adversarial training or mutual information-based regularization to balance data privacy and utility. However, these methods often require modifying the downstream task, struggle to achieve a satisfactory privacy-utility trade-off, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained mobile IoT devices. We propose Cloak, a novel data obfuscation framework based on latent diffusion models. In contrast to prior work, we employ contrastive learning to extract disentangled representations, which guide the latent diffusion process to retain useful information while concealing private information. This approach enables users with diverse privacy needs to navigate the privacy-utility trade-off with minimal retraining. Extensive experiments on four public time-series datasets, spanning multiple sensing modalities, and a dataset of facial images demonstrate that Cloak consistently outperforms state-of-the-art obfuscation techniques and is well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained settings."}

My semantics offer a natural compromize in the long-standing debate between Pearl and Dawid over counterfactuals: I agree with Dawid that universal causal determinism and unrealistic variables should be rejected, but I agree with Pearl that a general semantics of counterfactuals is nonetheless possible. I restrict attention to causal models that satisfy the Markov condition, only contain realistic variables, and are causally complete. Although I formulate my proposal using structural causal models, as does Pearl, I refrain from using so-called response variables. Moreover, I prove that my semantics is equivalent to two other recent proposals that do not involve structural causal models, and that it is in line with various comments on stochastic counterfactuals that have appeared in the literature more broadly.

This paper argues that such frameworks often fail for structural reasons: they implicitly assume linear causality, stable system boundaries, and largely predictable responses to regulation. In practice, AI operates within complex adaptive socio-technical systems in which harm is frequently emergent, delayed, redistributed, and amplified through feedback loops and strategic adaptation by system actors. As a result, compliance can increase while harm is displaced or concealed rather than eliminated. We propose a complexity-based framework for AI governance that treats regulation as intervention rather than control, prioritises dynamic system mapping over static classifications, and integrates causal reasoning and simulation for policy design under uncertainty. The aim is not to eliminate uncertainty, but to enable robust system stewardship through monitoring, learning, and iterative revision of governance interventions."}

Effective targeting depends on accurately separating customers with positive versus negative treatment effects. We propose an approach to estimate the conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) of marketing actions that aligns their estimation with the firm's profit objective. The method recognizes that, for many customers, treatment effects are so extreme that additional accuracy is unlikely to change the recommended actions. However, accuracy matters near the decision boundary, as small errors can alter targeting decisions. By modifying the firm's objective function in the standard profit maximization problem, our method yields a near-optimal targeting policy while simultaneously estimating CATEs. This introduces a new perspective on CATE estimation, reframing it as a problem of profit optimization rather than prediction accuracy. We establish the theoretical properties of the proposed method and demonstrate its performance and trade-offs using synthetic data."}

We study this through questions from MedQA, where the task is to select the most likely diagnosis. We introduce the Frequency-Based Probabilistic Ranker (FBPR), a lightweight method that scores options with a smoothed Naive Bayes over concept-diagnosis co-occurrence statistics from a large corpus. When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization.

To address this, we propose a human-AI collaborative approach for building a multilingual legal terminology database, based on a multi-agent framework. This approach integrates advanced large language models and legal domain experts throughout the entire process-from raw document preprocessing, article-level alignment, to terminology extraction, mapping, and quality assurance. Unlike a single automated pipeline, our approach places greater emphasis on how human experts participate in this multi-agent system. Humans and AI agents take on different roles: AI agents handle specific, repetitive tasks, such as OCR, text segmentation, semantic alignment, and initial terminology extraction, while human experts provide crucial oversight, review, and supervise the outputs with contextual knowledge and legal judgment. We tested the effectiveness of this framework using a trilingual parallel corpus comprising 35 key Chinese statutes, along with their English and Japanese translations. The experimental results show that this human-in-the-loop, multi-agent workflow not only improves the precision and consistency of multilingual legal terminology mapping but also offers greater scalability compared to traditional manual methods."}

Such models generate multi-step forecasts either directly, by predicting the full horizon at once, or iteratively, by feeding back their own predictions at each step. In both cases, the multi-step forecasts are prone to errors. To address this, we propose a Predictor-Corrector mechanism where the Predictor is any learned time-series model and the Corrector is a neural controlled differential equation. The Predictor forecasts, and the Corrector predicts the errors of the forecasts. Adding these errors to the forecasts improves forecast performance. The proposed Corrector works with irregularly sampled time series and continuous- and discrete-time Predictors. Additionally, we introduce two regularization strategies to improve the extrapolation performance of the Corrector with accelerated training. We evaluate our Corrector with diverse Predictors, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations, Contiformer, and DLinear, on synthetic, physics simulation, and real-world forecasting datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the Predictor-Corrector mechanism consistently improves the performance compared to Predictor alone."}

Current approaches either maintain unlimited memory stores, leading to computational intractability and privacy concerns, or employ simplistic forgetting mechanisms that compromise agent coherence and functionality. This paper introduces the Memory-Aware Retention Schema (MaRS), a novel framework for human-centered memory management in generative agents, coupled with six theoretically-grounded forgetting policies that balance performance, privacy, and computational efficiency. We present the Forgetful but Faithful Agent (FiFA) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses agent performance across narrative coherence, goal completion, social recall accuracy, privacy preservation, and cost efficiency. Through extensive experimentation involving 300 evaluation runs across multiple memory budgets and agent configurations, we demonstrate that our hybrid forgetting policy achieves superior performance (composite score: 0.911) while maintaining computational tractability and privacy guarantees. Our work establishes new benchmarks for memory-budgeted agent evaluation and provides practical guidelines for deploying generative agents in resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive environments. The theoretical foundations, implementation framework, and empirical results contribute to the emerging field of human-centered AI by addressing fundamental challenges in agent memory management that directly impact user trust, system scalability, and regulatory compliance."}

We introduce a new statistical primitive, the reproducibility budget $C_T$, which quantifies a system's finite capacity for statistical reproducibility - the extent to which its sampling process can remain governed by a consistent underlying distribution in the presence of both exogenous change and endogenous feedback. Formally, $C_T$ is defined as the cumulative Fisher-Rao path length of the coupled learner-environment evolution, measuring the total distributional motion accumulated during learning. From this construct we derive a drift-feedback generalization bound of order $O(T^{-1/2} + C_T/T)$, and we prove a matching minimax lower bound showing that this rate is minimax-optimal. Consequently, the results establish a reproducibility speed limit: no algorithm can achieve smaller worst-case generalization error than that imposed by the average Fisher-Rao drift rate $C_T/T$ of the data-generating process. The framework situates exogenous drift, adaptive data analysis, and performative prediction within a common geometric structure, with $C_T$ emerging as the intrinsic quantity measuring distributional motion across these settings."}

The key technical breakthroughs of QwenLong-L1.5 are as follows: (1) Long-Context Data Synthesis Pipeline: We develop a systematic synthesis framework that generates challenging reasoning tasks requiring multi-hop grounding over globally distributed evidence. By deconstructing documents into atomic facts and their underlying relationships, and then programmatically composing verifiable reasoning questions, our approach creates high-quality training data at scale, moving substantially beyond simple retrieval tasks to enable genuine long-range reasoning capabilities. (2) Stabilized Reinforcement Learning for Long-Context Training: To overcome the critical instability in long-context RL, we introduce task-balanced sampling with task-specific advantage estimation to mitigate reward bias, and propose Adaptive Entropy-Controlled Policy Optimization (AEPO) that dynamically regulates exploration-exploitation trade-offs. (3) Memory-Augmented Architecture for Ultra-Long Contexts: Recognizing that even extended context windows cannot accommodate arbitrarily long sequences, we develop a memory management framework with multi-stage fusion RL training that seamlessly integrates single-pass reasoning with iterative memory-based processing for tasks exceeding 4M tokens. Based on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, QwenLong-L1.5 achieves performance comparable to GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on long-context reasoning benchmarks, surpassing its baseline by 9.90 points on average. On ultra-long tasks (1M~4M tokens), QwenLong-L1.5's memory-agent framework yields a 9.48-point gain over the agent baseline.

Classical ILP systems operate over discrete predicates and typically rely on discretisation or hand-crafted numerical predicates, making it difficult to infer thresholds or arithmetic relations that must hold jointly across examples. Recent work has begun to address these limitations through tighter integrations of ILP with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or specialised numerical inference mechanisms. In this paper we investigate a modular alternative that couples the ILP system PyGol with the SMT solver Z3. Candidate clauses proposed by PyGol are interpreted as quantifier-free formulas over background theories such as linear or nonlinear real arithmetic, allowing numerical parameters to be instantiated and verified by the SMT solver while preserving ILP's declarative relational bias. This supports the induction of hybrid rules that combine symbolic predicates with learned numerical constraints, including thresholds, intervals, and multi-literal arithmetic relations. We formalise this SMT-ILP setting and evaluate it on a suite of synthetic datasets designed to probe linear, relational, nonlinear, and multi-hop reasoning. The results illustrate how a modular SMT-ILP architecture can extend the expressivity of symbolic rule learning, complementing prior numerical ILP approaches while providing a flexible basis for future extensions toward richer theory-aware induction."}

This study introduces a computational framework that integrates automated discourse analysis with the Synergy Degree Model (SDM) to quantify CPS synergy from group communication. Data were collected from 52 learners in 12 groups during a 5-week connectivist MOOC (cMOOC) activity. Nine classification models were applied to automatically identify ten CPS behaviors across four interaction levels: operation, wayfinding, sense-making, and creation. While BERT achieved the highest accuracy, GPT models demonstrated superior precision suitable for human-AI collaborative coding. Within the SDM framework, each interaction level was treated as a subsystem to compute group-level order parameters and derive synergy degrees. Permutation tests showed automated measures preserve construct validity, despite systematic biases at the subsystem level. Statistical analyses revealed significant task-type differences: survey study groups exhibited higher creation-order than mode study groups, suggesting \"controlled disorder\" may benefit complex problem solving. Importantly, synergy degree distinguished collaborative quality, ranging from excellent to failing groups. Findings establish synergy degree as a sensitive indicator of collaboration and demonstrate the feasibility of scaling fine-grained CPS analytics through AI-in-the-loop approaches."}

Our approach leverages both Nesterov's acceleration technique and the Krasnosel'skii-Mann (KM) iteration, while accounting for delayed inexact oracles, a key mechanism in asynchronous algorithms. We also introduce a unified approximate error condition for delayed inexact oracles, which can cover various practical scenarios. Under mild conditions and appropriate parameter updates, we establish both $\\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ non-asymptotic and $o(1/k^2)$ asymptotic convergence rates in expectation for the squared norm of residual. Our rate significantly improves the $\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rates in classical KM-type methods, including their asynchronous variants. We also establish $o(1/k^2)$ almost sure convergence rates and the almost sure convergence of iterates to a solution of the problem. Within our framework, we instantiate three settings for the underlying operator: (i) a deterministic universal delayed oracle; (ii) a stochastic delayed oracle; and (iii) a finite-sum structure with asynchronous updates. For each case, we instantiate our framework to obtain a concrete algorithmic variant for which our convergence results still apply, and whose iteration complexity depends linearly on the maximum delay. Finally, we verify our algorithms and theoretical results through two numerical examples on both matrix game and shallow neural network training problems."}

We then compare the quality and practicality of author labeling to three traditional annotation approaches for sentiment analysis and find author labeling to be higher quality, faster to acquire, and cheaper.

Risk-based approaches dominate both domains, yet systematically fail because they assume stable causal pathways, predictable actor responses, and controllable system boundaries. This paper extracts transferable methodological principles from CAPIRE (Curriculum, Archetypes, Policies, Interventions & Research Environment), an empirically validated framework for educational analytics that treats student dropout as an emergent property of curricular structures, institutional rules, and macroeconomic shocks. Drawing on longitudinal data from engineering programmes and causal inference methods, CAPIRE demonstrates that well-intentioned interventions routinely generate unintended consequences when system complexity is ignored. We argue that five core principles developed within CAPIRE - temporal observation discipline, structural mapping over categorical classification, archetype-based heterogeneity analysis, causal mechanism identification, and simulation-based policy design - transfer directly to the challenge of governing AI systems. The isomorphism is not merely analogical: both domains exhibit non-linearity, emergence, feedback loops, strategic adaptation, and path dependence. We propose Complex Systems AI Governance (CSAIG) as an integrated framework that operationalises these principles for regulatory design, shifting the central question from \"how risky is this AI system?\" to \"how does this intervention reshape system dynamics?\" The contribution is twofold: demonstrating that empirical lessons from one complex systems domain can accelerate governance design in another, and offering a concrete methodological architecture for complexity-aware AI regulation."}

We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence.

We introduce a unified mathematical framework for modeling concession dynamics based on a hyperbolic tangent curve, and propose two metrics burstiness tau and the Concession-Rigidity Index (CRI) to quantify the timing and rigidity of offer trajectories. We conduct a large-scale empirical comparison between human negotiators and four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) across natural-language and numeric-offers settings, with and without rich market context, as well as six controlled power-asymmetry scenarios. Our results reveal that, unlike humans who smoothly adapt to situations and infer the opponents position and strategies, LLMs systematically anchor at extremes of the possible agreement zone for negotiations and optimize for fixed points irrespective of leverage or context. Qualitative analysis further shows limited strategy diversity and occasional deceptive tactics used by LLMs. Moreover the ability of LLMs to negotiate does not improve with better models. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in current LLM negotiation capabilities and point to the need for models that better internalize opponent reasoning and context-dependent strategy."}

An interactive agent would recognize its own uncertainty, ask targeted questions, and retain new knowledge efficiently. Prior work has primarily explored effective ways for a teacher to instruct the student, where the teacher identifies student gaps and provides guidance. In this work, we shift the focus to the student and investigate effective strategies to actively query the teacher in seeking useful information. Across math and coding benchmarks, where baseline student models begin with near-zero performance, we show that student-led approaches consistently yield absolute Pass@k improvements of at least 0.5 over static baselines. To improve question quality, we train students using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with guidance from either self or stronger students. We find that this guided training enables smaller models to learn how to ask better questions, further enhancing learning efficiency."}

In this setting, the optimal goal-conditioned value function naturally forms a quasimetric, motivating Quasimetric RL (QRL), which constrains value learning to quasimetric mappings and enforces local consistency through discrete, trajectory-based constraints. We propose Eikonal-Constrained Quasimetric RL (Eik-QRL), a continuous-time reformulation of QRL based on the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This PDE-based structure makes Eik-QRL trajectory-free, requiring only sampled states and goals, while improving out-of-distribution generalization. We provide theoretical guarantees for Eik-QRL and identify limitations that arise under complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL), which integrates Eik-QRL into a hierarchical decomposition.

Behavioural targeting, also referred to as online profiling, involves monitoring people's online behaviour, and using the collected information to show people individually targeted advertisements. To protect privacy in the area of behavioural targeting, the EU lawmaker mainly relies on the consent requirement for the use of tracking technologies in the e-Privacy Directive, and on general data protection law. With informed consent requirements, the law aims to empower people to make choices in their best interests. But behavioural studies cast doubt on the effectiveness of the empowerment approach as a privacy protection measure. Many people click \"I agree\" to any statement that is presented to them. Therefore, to mitigate privacy problems such as chilling effects, this study argues for a combined approach of protecting and empowering the individual. Compared to the current approach, the lawmaker should focus more on protecting people. The PhD thesis is a legal study, but it also incorporates insights from other disciplines, such as computer science, behavioural economics, and media studies. This study is among the first to discuss the implications of behavioural research for European data protection policy. The topic of whether data protection law should apply to pseudonymous data is discussed in depth. The study contains a detailed analysis of the role of informed consent in data protection law, and gives much attention to the tension between protecting and empowering the individual within data protection law."}

However, because these resources are individually too small to participate in those auctions directly, an aggregator (e.g., a utility) must act on their behalf. This requires aggregating many decentralized resources, which is a computationally challenging task. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient and highly accurate method that is readily applicable to European day-ahead and intraday auctions. Distinct from existing methods, we aggregate only economically relevant power profiles, identified through price forecasts. The resulting flexibility is then conveyed to the market operator via exclusive groups of block bids. We evaluate our method for a utility serving the Swiss town of Losone, where flexibility from multiple heat pumps distributed across the grid must be aggregated and bid in the Swiss day-ahead auction. Results show that our method aggregates accurately, achieving 98% of the theoretically possible cost savings. This aggregation accuracy remains stable even as the number of heat pumps increases, while computation time grows only linearly, demonstrating strong scalability."}

However, they often struggle with long-text sequences due to the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon. This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\\% in MDQA dataset. Moreover, combining this approach with existing methods to reduce position encoding bias further enhances performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.4\\% in KV-Retrieval tasks."}

Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance."}

Predominant research efforts focus on end-to-end generation schemes to generate co-speech gestures, spanning GANs, VQ-VAE, and recent diffusion models. As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination. To delve into these intrinsic correlations, we propose a unified Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) learning approach for audio-inspired 3D gesture generation. Different from predominant research, our approach models this multi-modal implicit relationship by two explicit technique insights: i) To disentangle the complicated gesture movements, we first explore the gesture motion phase manifolds with periodic autoencoders to imitate human natures from realistic distributions while incorporating non-period ones from current latent states for instance-level diversities. ii) To model the hierarchical relationship of face motions, body gestures, and hand movements, driving the animation with cascaded guidance during learning. We exhibit our proposed approach on 3D avatars and extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art co-speech gesture generation methods by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Although educational resources are burgeoning, educators face challenges selecting materials that both align with intended learning outcomes and address diverse learner needs. Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting growing interest for their potential to create learning resources that better support personalization, but verifying coverage of intended outcomes still requires human alignment review, which is costly and limits scalability. We propose a framework that supports the cost-effective automation of evaluating alignment between educational resources and intended learning outcomes. Using human-generated materials, we benchmarked LLM-based text-embedding models and found that the most accurate model (Voyage) achieved 79% accuracy in detecting alignment. We then applied the optimal model to LLM-generated resources and, via expert evaluation, confirmed that it reliably assessed correspondence to intended outcomes (83% accuracy). Finally, in a three-group experiment with 360 learners, higher alignment scores were positively related to greater learning performance, chi-squared(2, N = 360) = 15.39, p < 0.001. These findings show that embedding-based alignment scores can facilitate scalable personalization by confirming alignment with learning outcomes, which allows teachers to focus on tailoring content to diverse learner needs."}

However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \\(1 - \\max(P_{\\mathrm{target}})\\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks."}

However, current implementations rely on recurrent Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) backbones and single-step training objectives, which limit their ability to capture long-range dependencies and produce coherent forecast trajectories across lead times. To address these limitations, we developed HydroDiffusion, a diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework with a decoder-only state space model backbone. The proposed framework jointly denoises full multi-day trajectories in a single pass, ensuring temporal coherence and mitigating error accumulation common in autoregressive prediction. HydroDiffusion is evaluated across 531 watersheds in the contiguous United States (CONUS) in the CAMELS dataset. We benchmark HydroDiffusion against two diffusion baselines with LSTM backbones, as well as the recently proposed Diffusion-based Runoff Model (DRUM). Results show that HydroDiffusion achieves strong nowcast accuracy when driven by observed meteorological forcings, and maintains consistent performance across the full simulation horizon. Moreover, HydroDiffusion delivers stronger deterministic and probabilistic forecast skill than DRUM in operational forecasting. These results establish HydroDiffusion as a robust generative modeling framework for medium-range streamflow forecasting, providing both a new modeling benchmark and a foundation for future research on probabilistic hydrologic prediction at continental scales."}

Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms."}

Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery."}

Across ten diverse benchmarks, we train two base models, Qwen3-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, with AutoTool. With fewer parameters, AutoTool consistently outperforms advanced LLM agents and tool-integration methods, yielding average gains of 6.4% in math & science reasoning, 4.5% in search-based QA, 7.7% in code generation, and 6.9% in multimodal understanding.

While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition. Our findings highlight the importance of active user interaction and role-aware clarification for more reliable human-agent communication."}

We propose Eikonal-Constrained Quasimetric RL (Eik-QRL), a continuous-time reformulation of QRL based on the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This PDE-based structure makes Eik-QRL trajectory-free, requiring only sampled states and goals, while improving out-of-distribution generalization. We provide theoretical guarantees for Eik-QRL and identify limitations that arise under complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL), which integrates Eik-QRL into a hierarchical decomposition.

Existing data selection methods, ranging from manual curation to heuristics based on length, entropy, or overall loss, fail to capture the causal importance of individual reasoning steps, limiting distillation efficiency. To address this, we propose Attention Influence for Reasoning (AIR), a principled, unsupervised and training-free framework that leverages mechanistic insights of the retrieval head to select high-value post-training data. AIR first identifies reasoning-critical attention heads of an off-the-shelf model, then constructs a weakened reference model with disabled head influence, and finally quantifies the resulting loss divergence as the Attention Influence Score. This score enables fine-grained assessment at both the step and sample levels, supporting step-level weighted fine-tuning and global sample selection. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that AIR consistently improves reasoning accuracy, surpassing heuristic baselines and effectively isolating the most critical steps and samples.

In this work, we introduce EEG-DLite, a data distillation framework that enables more efficient pre-training by selectively removing noisy and redundant samples from large EEG datasets. EEG-DLite begins by encoding EEG segments into compact latent representations using a self-supervised autoencoder, allowing sample selection to be performed efficiently and with reduced sensitivity to noise. Based on these representations, EEG-DLite filters out outliers and minimizes redundancy, resulting in a smaller yet informative subset that retains the diversity essential for effective foundation model training.

Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves a 20.14% absolute improvement in task completion over base models without increasing conversation turns even surpassing even much larger proprietary models, demonstrating the promise of clarification-centric user-agent interactions."}

This reduces the need for empirical validation, enabling faster construction while providing theoretical guarantees under these assumptions. OptLCMS also allows explicit control of the allowable error threshold, improving flexibility in practice.

(2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains.

This leads to slow and unstable convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm. RPO uses external models to identify hallucination sources and generate concise reflective hints, enabling the construction of on-policy preference pairs with stronger contrastiveness and clearer preference signals. We theoretically show that conditioning on hints increases the expected preference margin through mutual information and improves sample efficiency while remaining within the policy distribution family.

In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography."}

In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations.

Through a systematic evaluation of a leading SLM (Qwen3 4B), we find that while the base model exhibits fundamental limitations in arithmetic tasks, our proposed error-driven method, which clusters erroneous predictions to refine prompt-rules iteratively, dramatically improves performance, elevating the model's accuracy to 70.8\\%. Our results suggest that developing reliable, interpretable, and industrially deployable AI assistants can be achieved not only through costly fine-tuning but also via systematic, error-driven prompt optimization, enabling small models to surpass larger language models (GPT-3.5 Turbo) in a privacy-compliant manner."}

While several studies have explored how LLMs can generate or solve optimization models, far less is understood about what these models actually learn regarding problem structure or algorithmic behavior. This study investigates how LLMs internally represent combinatorial optimization problems and whether such representations can support downstream decision tasks. We adopt a twofold methodology combining direct querying, which assesses LLM capacity to explicitly extract instance features, with probing analyses that examine whether such information is implicitly encoded within their hidden layers. The probing framework is further extended to a per-instance algorithm selection task, evaluating whether LLM-derived representations can predict the best-performing solver. Experiments span four benchmark problems and three instance representations. Results show that LLMs exhibit moderate ability to recover feature information from problem instances, either through direct querying or probing. Notably, the predictive power of LLM hidden-layer representations proves comparable to that achieved through traditional feature extraction, suggesting that LLMs capture meaningful structural information relevant to optimization performance."}

However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget."}

If the data were stochastic, then one can show that $E_α$ has probability at least $1-α$ under a wide class of distributions (eg: sub-Gaussian, symmetric, variance-bounded, etc.). In fact, we show that on the Ville event $E_0$ of probability one, the regret on every path in $E_0$ is eventually bounded by $\\ln \\ln V_T$ (up to constants).

We release our code and model at https://github.com/sitaocheng/DERL", "summary": "The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the \"meta-gradient\" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention."}

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control."}

To this end, we use a flexible family of uncertainty measures that distinguishes between total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty of second-order distributions. These measures can be instantiated with specific loss functions, so-called proper scoring rules, to control their characteristics, and we show that different characteristics are useful for different tasks. In particular, we show that, for the task of selective prediction, the scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. On the other hand, for out-of-distribution detection, our results confirm that mutual information, a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, performs best. Furthermore, in an active learning setting, epistemic uncertainty based on zero-one loss is shown to consistently outperform other uncertainty measures."}

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on behalf of humans in collaborative and competitive workflows, there is a pressing need to evaluate whether and under what conditions they exhibit envy-like preferences. In this paper, we test whether LLMs show envy-like behavior toward each other. We considered two scenarios: (1) A point allocation game that tests whether a model tries to win over its peer. (2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains.

However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, naïve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints."}

Results show consistent improvements in SEC-domain validation loss for both models, with the largest gains occurring within the first 200M tokens and diminishing returns thereafter.

A data-efficiency frontier further shows that both models move toward improved specialization with negligible mixed-domain degradation.

However, current adaptations of GRPO for the flow matching-based image generation neglect a foundational conflict between its core principles and the distinct dynamics of the visual synthesis process. This mismatch leads to two key limitations: (i) Uniformly applying a sparse terminal reward across all timesteps impairs temporal credit assignment, ignoring the differing criticality of generation phases from early structure formation to late-stage tuning. (ii) Exclusive reliance on relative, intra-group rewards causes the optimization signal to fade as training converges, leading to the optimization stagnation when reward diversity is entirely depleted. To address these limitations, we propose Value-Anchored Group Policy Optimization (VGPO), a framework that redefines value estimation across both temporal and group dimensions. Specifically, VGPO transforms the sparse terminal reward into dense, process-aware value estimates, enabling precise credit assignment by modeling the expected cumulative reward at each generative stage. Furthermore, VGPO replaces standard group normalization with a novel process enhanced by absolute values to maintain a stable optimization signal even as reward diversity declines. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that VGPO achieves state-of-the-art image quality while simultaneously improving task-specific accuracy, effectively mitigating reward hacking.

In this work, we propose a stance-aware structural modeling that encodes each post in a discourse with its stance signal and aggregates reply embedddings by stance category enabling a scalable and semantically enriched representation of the entire thread. To enhance structural awareness, we introduce stance distribution and hierarchical depth as covariates, capturing stance imbalance and the influence of reply depth. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior methods in the ability to predict truthfulness of a rumor. We also demonstrate that our model is versatile for early detection and cross-platfrom generalization."}

Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery."}

As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence."}

We investigate whether introducing \\emph{simple graph priors} can enhance \\emph{pretrained tabular transformers}. Concretely, we introduce {BOLERO}, a lightweight, static bipartite graph head that augments {RoBERTa-Tab} (a RoBERTa-style tabular backbone pretrained with masked-token prediction.) Each instance connects to feature/value anchors; a small GNN refines row representations, while the backbone remains frozen. We evaluate on 80 classification and 64 regression datasets from the TP-BERTa benchmark suites, comparing against strong baselines including XGBoost, CatBoost, TabPFN-v2, MITRA, TabICL, TP-BERTa, and RoBERTa-Tab. To ensure statistically sound conclusions, we follow best practices for multi-dataset evaluation: pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on per-dataset score differences and effect sizes (median improvement with confidence intervals), rather than mean-rank post-hoc tests that depend on the competitor pool. BOLERO achieves the highest number of statistically significant wins across both classification and regression, demonstrating that lightweight graph priors meaningfully improve pretrained tabular transformers."}

While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup."}

In contexts of emotional need or instability, this tension can lead users to resolve the conflict through imaginative projection, attributing interiority, intention, or presence to a system that possesses none. The paper situates these dynamics within emerging clinical reports, develops a phenomenological account of how they unfold, and argues that current engagement-optimised design choices exacerbate the risk.

This study examines the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), ChatGPT GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, to assess greenspace attractiveness similarly to humans using Google Street View imagery. We compared model outputs with responses from a geo-questionnaire of residents in Lodz, Poland, across both formal (for example, parks and managed greenspaces) and informal (for example, meadows and wastelands) greenspaces. Survey respondents and models indicated whether each greenspace was attractive or unattractive and provided up to three free text explanations. Analyses examined how often their attractiveness judgments aligned and compared their explanations after classifying them into shared reasoning categories. Results show high AI human agreement for attractive formal greenspaces and unattractive informal spaces, but low alignment for attractive informal and unattractive formal greenspaces. Models consistently emphasized aesthetic and design oriented features, underrepresenting safety, functional infrastructure, and locally embedded qualities valued by survey respondents. While these findings highlight the potential for scalable pre-assessment, they also underscore the need for human oversight and complementary participatory approaches.

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control. Overall, reusable value profiles provide a tractable computational account of belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments and yield testable signatures of belief-dependent control and behavioral flexibility."}

This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities."}

Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models."}

The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture."}

Code is available at https://github.com/ShanechiLab/mrine", "summary": "Real-time decoding of target variables from multiple simultaneously recorded neural time-series modalities, such as discrete spiking activity and continuous field potentials, is important across various neuroscience applications. However, a major challenge for doing so is that different neural modalities can have different timescales (i.e., sampling rates) and different probabilistic distributions, or can even be missing at some time-steps. Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities. In both simulations and three distinct multiscale brain datasets, we show that our model can aggregate information across modalities with different timescales and distributions and missing samples to improve real-time target decoding. Further, our method outperforms various linear and nonlinear multimodal benchmarks in doing so."}

Speaker recognition in the speech domain usually examines phonetic or acoustic properties of a voice, and these methods can be accurate and robust under certain conditions. However, if a speaker disguises their voice or employs text-to-speech software, vocal properties may no longer be reliable, leaving only their linguistic content available for analysis. Authorship attribution methods traditionally use syntactic, semantic, and related linguistic information to identify writers of written text (authorship attribution). In this paper, we apply a content-based authorship approach to speech that has been transcribed into text, using what a speaker says to attribute speech to individuals (speaker attribution). We introduce a stylometric method, StyloSpeaker, which incorporates character, word, token, sentence, and style features from the stylometric literature on authorship, to assess whether two transcripts were produced by the same speaker. We evaluate this method on two types of transcript formatting: one approximating prescriptive written text with capitalization and punctuation and another normalized style that removes these conventions. The transcripts' conversation topics are also controlled to varying degrees. We find generally higher attribution performance on normalized transcripts, except under the strongest topic control condition, in which overall performance is highest. Finally, we compare this more explainable stylometric model to black-box neural approaches on the same data and investigate which stylistic features most effectively distinguish speakers."}

TM, similar to previous paradigms, gradually transforms noise samples to data samples, however it uses a second ``internal'' generative model to implement the transition steps, making the transitions more expressive compared to diffusion and flow models. To make this paradigm tractable, TM employs a large backbone network and a smaller \"head\" module to efficiently execute the generative transition step. In this work, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation into the design, training and sampling of the head in TM frameworks, focusing on its time-continuous bidirectional variant. Through comprehensive ablations and experimentation involving training 56 different 1.7B text-to-image models (resulting in 549 unique evaluations) we evaluate the affect of the head module architecture and modeling during training as-well as a useful family of stochastic TM samplers. We analyze the impact on generation quality, training, and inference efficiency. We find that TM with an MLP head, trained with a particular time weighting and sampled with high frequency sampler provides best ranking across all metrics reaching state-of-the-art among all tested baselines, while Transformer head with sequence scaling and low frequency sampling is a runner up excelling at image aesthetics. Lastly, we believe the experiments presented highlight the design aspects that are likely to provide most quality and efficiency gains, while at the same time indicate what design choices are not likely to provide further gains."}

Yet current approaches are often computationally expensive, data-intensive, susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, and prone to performance degradation in multi-turn interactions or when handling implicit queries. To address these challenges, we conceptualize personalization as a model editing task and introduce Personalization Editing, a framework that applies localized edits guided by clustered preference representations. This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty. Unlike prior benchmarks, UPQA directly evaluates a model's ability to recall and apply specific user preferences. Across experimental settings, Personalization Editing achieves higher editing accuracy and greater computational efficiency than fine-tuning, while outperforming prompting-based baselines in multi-turn conversations and implicit preference questions settings."}

Training combines activation normalization, a separation regularizer, and anchor or subspace regularizers that attract rare labeled examples to predefined directions or axis-aligned subspaces. The anchored geometry enables two practical interventions: reversible behavioral steering that projects out a concept's latent component at inference, and permanent removal via targeted weight ablation of anchored dimensions. Experiments on structured autoencoders show selective attenuation of targeted concepts with negligible impact on orthogonal features, and complete elimination with reconstruction error approaching theoretical bounds. Sparse Concept Anchoring therefore provides a practical pathway to interpretable, steerable behavior in learned representations."}

Recent advances in patch-based Transformer models have shown strong potential in various time series forecasting tasks. However, most existing methods rely on fixed-size patch embedding, making it difficult to model the complex and heterogeneous patterns of airport passenger flows. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deformable temporal-spectral transformer named DTSFormer that integrates a multiscale deformable partitioning module and a joint temporal-spectral filtering module. Specifically, the input sequence is dynamically partitioned into multiscale temporal patches via a novel window function-based masking, enabling the extraction of heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. Then, within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to capture both high- and low-frequency components, thereby emphasizing the volatility and periodicity inherent in airport passenger flows. Finally, the resulting multi-frequency features are subsequently fused in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world passenger flow data collected at Beijing Capital International Airport from January 2023 to March 2024. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons. Further analysis shows that the deformable partitioning module aligns patch lengths with dominant periods and heterogeneous trends, enabling superior capture of sudden high-frequency fluctuations."}

Language-related changes can be automatically identified through the analysis of outputs from linguistic assessment tasks, such as picture description. Language models show promise as a basis for screening tools for AD, but their limited interpretability poses a challenge in distinguishing true linguistic markers of cognitive decline from surface-level textual patterns. To address this issue, we examine how surface form variation affects classification performance, with the goal of assessing the ability of language models to represent underlying semantic indicators. We introduce a novel approach where texts surface forms are transformed by altering syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantic content. The transformations significantly modify the structure and lexical content, as indicated by low BLEU and chrF scores, yet retain the underlying semantics, as reflected in high semantic similarity scores, isolating the effect of semantic information, and finding models perform similarly to if they were using the original text, with only small deviations in macro-F1. We also investigate whether language from picture descriptions retains enough detail to reconstruct the original image using generative models. We found that image-based transformations add substantial noise reducing classification accuracy. Our methodology provides a novel way of looking at what features influence model predictions, and allows the removal of possible spurious correlations. We find that just using semantic information, language model based classifiers can still detect AD. This work shows that difficult to detect semantic impairment can be identified, addressing an overlooked feature of linguistic deterioration, and opening new pathways for early detection systems."}

Unlike ESAN's bag-based representation, GoMS constructs a graph where nodes represent subgraphs and edges capture their structural relationships, preserving critical topological information about how substructures are connected and overlap within the molecule. Through extensive experiments on public molecular datasets, we demonstrate that GoMS outperforms ESAN and other baseline methods, with particularly improvements for large molecules containing more than 100 atoms. The performance gap widens as molecular size increases, demonstrating GoMS's effectiveness for modeling industrial-scale molecules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GoMS can distinguish molecules with identical subgraph compositions but different spatial arrangements. Our approach shows particular promise for materials science applications involving complex molecules where properties emerge from the interplay between multiple functional units. By capturing substructure relationships that are lost in bag-based approaches, GoMS represents a significant advance toward scalable and interpretable molecular property prediction for real-world applications."}

Drawing on Bateson's double bind theory, clinical literature on shared psychotic disorder, and McGilchrist's hemisphere theory, we show how the combination of high linguistic coherence and the absence of an underlying subject produces a structural tension for the user: language suggests an interlocutor, while intuition registers a void. In contexts of emotional need or instability, this tension can lead users to resolve the conflict through imaginative projection, attributing interiority, intention, or presence to a system that possesses none. The paper situates these dynamics within emerging clinical reports, develops a phenomenological account of how they unfold, and argues that current engagement-optimised design choices exacerbate the risk. We conclude by proposing 'ontological honesty' as a necessary design principle for mitigating technologically mediated folie a deux."}

Although the current allocation policy was recently revised in 2018, a major concern is that it does not adequately take into account pretransplant and post-transplant mortality. In this paper, we take an important step toward addressing these deficiencies.\n  To begin with, we use historical data from UNOS to develop a new simulator that enables us to evaluate and compare the performance of different policies. We then leverage our simulator to demonstrate that the status quo policy is considerably inferior to the myopic policy that matches incoming donors to the patient who maximizes the number of years gained by the transplant. Moreover, we develop improved policies that account for the dynamic nature of the allocation process through the use of potentials -- a measure of a patient's utility in future allocations that we introduce. We also show that batching together even a handful of donors -- which is a viable option for a certain type of donors -- further enhances performance. Our simulator also allows us to evaluate the effect of critical, and often unexplored, factors in the allocation, such as geographic proximity and the tendency to reject offers by the transplant centers."}

This study leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to automate actuator settings for optimal greenhouse management. To enhance interpretability and trust in the model decision-making process, both local and global explanation techniques were employed using model-inherent interpretation, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley additive explanations (SHAP). These explainability methods provide information on how different sensor readings, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, light, and outer climate, contribute to actuator control decisions in an automated greenhouse.

We conduct an early-stage scaling-law analysis of continued pretraining on U.S. SEC filings, training 1B and 3B-parameter Llama-3.2 models on a 400M-token financial corpus with validation checkpoints at 50M, 100M, 200M, and 400M tokens. Results show consistent improvements in SEC-domain validation loss for both models, with the largest gains occurring within the first 200M tokens and diminishing returns thereafter. Power-law fits reveal shallow exponents, indicating that financial language is highly regular and efficiently learnable under continued pretraining. General-domain validation loss remains effectively unchanged across all token budgets, suggesting minimal drift and no signs of catastrophic forgetting. A data-efficiency frontier further shows that both models move toward improved specialization with negligible mixed-domain degradation. Together, these findings provide early empirical guidance for scaling financial foundation models, suggesting that meaningful domain adaptation can be achieved with comparatively modest token budgets and that larger model scales (7B-70B) remain tractable under projected data requirements."}

Using CEEMDAN, we extract nine IMFs spanning high-frequency fluctuations to long-term trends. Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths. Visibility-based methods are more sensitive to amplitude variability and typically generate higher clustering, while recurrence graphs better preserve temporal dependencies. These results provide guidance for designing GNN architectures tailored to the structural properties of decomposed components, supporting more effective predictive modeling of financial time series."}

However, recent work suggests that relying on approximate symmetry can offer greater flexibility and robustness. Despite promising empirical evidence, there has been little theoretical understanding, and in particular, a direct comparison between exact and approximate symmetry is missing from the literature. In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice. Beyond this, our tools and techniques may be of independent interest for the broader study of symmetries in machine learning."}

Small shifts in the behavior of these users are often sufficient to propagate widely throughout the network. A similar phenomenon occurs during neural network fine tuning. Conventional fine tuning of convolutional neural networks typically adds a new linear classification layer on top of a large pre trained model. Instead we argue that improved adaptation can be achieved by first pruning the network to retain only the most important neurons and then performing fine tuning.\n  We propose a graph theory based method for pruning neural networks that is designed to improve fine tuning performance. In this method each neuron is represented as a node and edges encode similarity between neurons. Neurons are pruned based on importance scores computed using eigenvector centrality. The resulting pruned network is then fine tuned using only the most central neurons. We evaluate the proposed method on VGGNet EfficientNet and ResNet models using the TF Flowers Caltech one zero one and Oxford Flowers one zero two datasets. The proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy while significantly reducing model complexity. On the Oxford Flowers one zero two dataset the method achieves forty eight percent classification accuracy compared to thirty percent accuracy obtained by the baseline VGGNet model."}

However, achieving efficient GNN inference on edge devices poses significant challenges, limiting their application in real-world edge scenarios. This is due to the high computational cost of GNNs and limited hardware resources on edge devices, which prevent GNN inference from meeting real-time and energy requirements. As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the integrated co-inference engine in GCoDE enables efficient deployment and execution of GNN co-inference.

We present Memoria, a modular memory framework that augments LLM-based conversational systems with persistent, interpretable, and context-rich memory. Memoria integrates two complementary components: dynamic session-level summarization and a weighted knowledge graph (KG)-based user modelling engine that incrementally captures user traits, preferences, and behavioral patterns as structured entities and relationships.

Our research deviates from previous studies that identified impacts of keywords and sentiments - we expand on that method by a sequence of topic modeling, temporal analysis, breakpoint detection and segment optimization to detect the optimal time period for training. This results in improving predictions by providing the model with nuanced patterns that occur from that era's socioeconomic and political status while also resolving the shortage of pertinent stock data to train on.

We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs."}

We prove that in the transductive setting, the mistake bound is at least $Ω(\\sqrt{d})$.

In this study, we revisit this RL-centric belief through a systematic and controlled comparison of SFT and RL on VLM Reasoning. Using identical data sources, we find that the relative effectiveness of SFT and RL is conditional and strongly influenced by model capacity, data scale, and data distribution. Contrary to common assumptions, our findings show that SFT plays a crucial role across several scenarios: (1) Effectiveness for weaker models. SFT more reliably elicits reasoning capabilities in smaller or weaker VLMs. (2) Data efficiency. SFT with only 2K achieves comparable or better reasoning performance to RL with 20K. (3) Cross-modal transferability. SFT demonstrates stronger generalization across modalities. Moreover, we identify a pervasive issue of deceptive rewards, where higher rewards fail to correlate with better reasoning accuracy in RL. These results challenge the prevailing \"RL over SFT\" narrative.

This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

The computational overhead (approximately 200x slower than classical ACGAN) reflects simulator artifacts rather than inherent quantum costs.\n  On MNIST, we observe that the energy-regularized model (termed QACGAN) achieves high classification accuracy (99 to 100 percent) within 5 epochs compared to 87.8 percent for ACGAN, suggesting the auxiliary term influences class conditioning. However, sample quality metrics (FID) show high variance across runs (coefficient of variation approximately 25 percent at epoch 5), with values ranging from 19.92 to 35.96. Extended runs stabilize around FID 23 to 24, comparable to the ACGAN baseline.\n  We explicitly do not claim quantum advantage, improved stability in any general sense, or scalability beyond this toy setting.

By integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aerial base stations, and terrestrial base stations, LAINs can support mission-critical applications such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, and real-time sensing. However, these systems face key challenges, including energy-constrained UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and heterogeneous computing resources. To address these issues, we propose an integrated air-ground collaborative network and formulate a time-dependent integer nonlinear programming problem that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning and task offloading decisions. The problem is challenging to solve due to temporal coupling among decision variables. Therefore, we design a hierarchical learning framework with two timescales. At the large timescale, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism enables the energy-aware and incentive-compatible trajectory assignment. At the small timescale, we propose the diffusion-heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization, a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that embeds latent diffusion models into actor networks. Each UAV samples actions from a Gaussian prior and refines them via observation-conditioned denoising, enhancing adaptability and policy diversity. Extensive simulations show that our framework outperforms baselines in energy efficiency, task success rate, and convergence performance."}

Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can produce human-readable explanations and facilitate feature analysis, potentially reducing the manual workload of fraud analysts and informing system refinements. However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings. Although these LLMs still lag behind specialized classifiers, they narrow the performance gap and provide interpretable rationales, highlighting their value as assistive tools in fraud analysis."}

At the same time, AI's environmental footprint is expanding increasingly. This report describes the systemic environmental risks of artificial intelligence, in particular, moving beyond direct impacts such as energy and water usage. Systemic environmental risks of AI are emergent, cross-sector harms to climate, biodiversity, freshwater, and broader socioecological systems that arise primarily from AI's integration into social, economic, and physical infrastructures, rather than its direct resource use, and that propagate through feedbacks, yielding nonlinear, inequitable, and potentially irreversible impacts. While these risks are emergent and quantification is uncertain, this report aims to provide an overview of systemic environmental risks. Drawing on a narrative literature review, we propose a three-level framework that operationalizes systemic risk analysis. The framework identifies the structural conditions that shape AI development, the risk amplification mechanisms that propagate environmental harm, and the impacts that manifest as observable ecological and social consequences. We illustrate the framework in expert-interview-based case studies across agriculture and biodiversity, oil and gas, and waste management."}

We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance."}

While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition.

Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves a 20.14% absolute improvement in task completion over base models without increasing conversation turns even surpassing even much larger proprietary models, demonstrating the promise of clarification-centric user-agent interactions."}

Noise-based regularizers such as Dropout and DropConnect address this issue by injecting stochastic perturbations during training, but the noise they apply is typically uniform across a layer or across a batch of samples, which can suppress both harmful and beneficial co-adaptation.\n  This work introduces PerNodeDrop, a lightweight stochastic regularization method. It applies per-sample, per-node perturbations to break the uniformity of the noise injected by existing techniques, thereby allowing each node to experience input-specific variability. Hence, PerNodeDrop preserves useful co-adaptation while applying regularization. This narrows the gap between training and validation performance and improves reliability on unseen data, as evident from the experiments.\n  Although superficially similar to DropConnect, PerNodeDrop operates at the sample level. It drops weights at the sample level, not the batch level. An expected-loss analysis formalizes how its perturbations attenuate excessive co-adaptation while retaining predictive interactions.

Cities play a critical role in meeting IPCC targets, generating 75% of global energy-related GHG emissions. In Houston, Texas, on-road transportation represents 48% of baseline emissions in the Climate Action Plan (CAP). To reach net-zero by 2050, the CAP targets a 70% emissions reduction from a 2014 baseline, offset by 30% renewable energy. This goal is challenging because Houston is low-density and auto-dependent, with 89% of on-road emissions from cars and small trucks and limited public transit usage. Socio-economic disparities further constrain Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) adoption. Strategies focus on expanding ZEV access and reducing Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by 20% through transit improvements and city design. This paper presents methods for establishing an on-road emissions baseline and evaluating policies that leverage socio-economic indicators and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to accelerate ZEV adoption and reduce VMT. Smart parking, transit incentives, secure data systems, and ZEV fleet management support improvements in modal split and system reliability. Policy options are analyzed and potential actions identified.

These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events.

We release our code and model at https://github.com/sitaocheng/DERL", "summary": "The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the \"meta-gradient\" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention."}

Our experiments on Gaussian transport tasks and MNIST latent translation demonstrate that these surrogates achieve competitive performance while offering dramatic improvements in efficiency and interpretability.

(2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains.

We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs."}

We find that aesthetic-aligned generation models frequently default to conventionally beautiful outputs, failing to respect instructions for low-quality or negative imagery.

Many studies suggest that introducing the SFT stage not only fails to improve reasoning ability but may also negatively impact model training. In this study, we revisit this RL-centric belief through a systematic and controlled comparison of SFT and RL on VLM Reasoning. Using identical data sources, we find that the relative effectiveness of SFT and RL is conditional and strongly influenced by model capacity, data scale, and data distribution. Contrary to common assumptions, our findings show that SFT plays a crucial role across several scenarios: (1) Effectiveness for weaker models. SFT more reliably elicits reasoning capabilities in smaller or weaker VLMs. (2) Data efficiency. SFT with only 2K achieves comparable or better reasoning performance to RL with 20K. (3) Cross-modal transferability. SFT demonstrates stronger generalization across modalities. Moreover, we identify a pervasive issue of deceptive rewards, where higher rewards fail to correlate with better reasoning accuracy in RL. These results challenge the prevailing \"RL over SFT\" narrative. They highlight that the role of SFT may have been underestimated and support a more balanced post-training pipeline in which SFT and RL function as complementary components."}

We review major testing techniques and further consider emerging factors such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication and foundation models, including large language models and vision foundation models, to understand their roles in enhancing ADS testing.

In order to exploit these structural dependencies, our approach integrates observations across all tasks and learns a global joint distribution, while still allowing personalised inference for new tasks. In this regard, we identify two key sources of epistemic uncertainty, namely structural uncertainty in the latent reward dependencies across arms and tasks, and user-specific uncertainty due to incomplete context and limited interaction history. To put our method into practice, we represent the joint distribution over tasks and rewards using a particle-based approximation of a log-density Gaussian process. This representation enables flexible, data-driven discovery of both inter-arm and inter-task dependencies without prior assumptions on the latent variables.

At the same time, the training and large-scale deployment of AI systems rely on finite and unevenly distributed energy, networking, and computational resources. This tension exposes a largely unexamined problem in current AI governance: while expanding access to AI is essential for social inclusion and equal opportunity, unconstrained growth in AI use risks unsustainable resource consumption, whereas restricting access threatens to entrench inequality and undermine basic rights.\n  This paper argues that access to AI outputs largely derived from publicly produced knowledge should not be treated solely as a commercial service, but as a fundamental civil interest requiring explicit protection. We show that existing regulatory frameworks largely ignore the coupling between equitable access and resource constraints, leaving critical questions of fairness, sustainability, and long-term societal impact unresolved. To address this gap, we propose recognizing access to AI as an \\emph{Intergenerational Civil Right}, establishing a legal and ethical framework that simultaneously safeguards present-day inclusion and the rights of future generations.\n  Beyond normative analysis, we explore how this principle can be technically realized. Drawing on emerging paradigms in IoT--Edge--Cloud computing, decentralized inference, and energy-aware networking, we outline technological trajectories and a strawman architecture for AI Delivery Networks that support equitable access under strict resource constraints. By framing AI as a shared social infrastructure rather than a discretionary market commodity, this work connects governance principles with concrete system design choices, offering a pathway toward AI deployment that is both socially just and environmentally sustainable."}

A lightweight lambda-curriculum is adopted to stabilize training as the state expands from a risk-neutral reduced HJB to a risk-averse HJB.

The resulting kernel coincides with a generalized polyharmonic spline; however, unlike existing approaches, it is not chosen empirically but arises as a consequence of the indifference principle.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for STEM Interdisciplinary education, current methodologies employing Prompt Engineering (PE), Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), or standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) often fall short of supporting this paradigm. Existing methods are hindered by three fundamental challenges: the inability to dynamically model latent student cognitive states; severe reward sparsity and delay inherent in long-term educational goals; and a tendency toward policy collapse lacking strategic diversity due to reliance on behavioral cloning. Recognizing the unobservability and dynamic complexity of these interactions, we formalize the Socratic Interdisciplinary Instructional Problem (SIIP) as a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), demanding simultaneous global exploration and fine-grained policy refinement. To this end, we propose ERL4SIIP, a novel Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL) framework specifically tailored for this domain. ERL4SIIP integrates: (1) a dynamic student simulator grounded in a STEM knowledge graph for latent state modeling; (2) a Hierarchical Reward Mechanism that decomposes long-horizon goals into dense signals; and (3) a LoRA-Division based optimization strategy coupling evolutionary algorithms for population-level global search with PPO for local gradient ascent."}

However, the landscape of AI risk mitigation frameworks is fragmented, uses inconsistent terminology, and has gaps in coverage. This paper introduces a preliminary AI Risk Mitigation Taxonomy to organize AI risk mitigations and provide a common frame of reference. The Taxonomy was developed through a rapid evidence scan of 13 AI risk mitigation frameworks published between 2023-2025, which were extracted into a living database of 831 AI risk mitigations. The mitigations were iteratively clustered & coded to create the Taxonomy. The preliminary AI Risk Mitigation Taxonomy organizes mitigations into four categories and 23 subcategories: (1) Governance & Oversight: Formal organizational structures and policy frameworks that establish human oversight mechanisms and decision protocols; (2) Technical & Security: Technical, physical, and engineering safeguards that secure AI systems and constrain model behaviors; (3) Operational Process: processes and management frameworks governing AI system deployment, usage, monitoring, incident handling, and validation; and (4) Transparency & Accountability: formal disclosure practices and verification mechanisms that communicate AI system information and enable external scrutiny. The rapid evidence scan and taxonomy construction also revealed several cases where terms like 'risk management' and 'red teaming' are used widely but refer to different responsible actors, actions, and mechanisms of action to reduce risk. This Taxonomy and associated mitigation database, while preliminary, offers a starting point for collation and synthesis of AI risk mitigations. It also offers an accessible, structured way for different actors in the AI ecosystem to discuss and coordinate action to reduce risks from AI."}

Structural pruning, which reduces model size by removing redundant computational units such as neurons, has been widely explored as a solution, and this study devotes to input sparsification, an increasingly popular technique that improves efficiency by selectively activating only a subset of entry values for each input. However, existing approaches focus primarily on computational savings, often overlooking the representational consequences of sparsification and leaving a noticeable performance gap compared to full models. In this work, we first reinterpret input sparsification as a form of dynamic structural pruning. Motivated by the spontaneous baseline firing rates observed in biological neurons, we introduce a small set of trainable spontaneous neurons that act as compensatory units to stabilize activations in sparsified LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that these auxiliary neurons substantially reduce the sparsification-induced performance gap while generalizing effectively across tasks."}

Current model-risk frameworks assume static, well-specified algorithms and one-time validations; large language models and multi-agent trading systems violate those assumptions by learning continuously, exchanging latent signals, and exhibiting emergent behavior. Drawing on complex adaptive systems theory, we model these technologies as decentralized ensembles whose risks propagate along multiple time-scales. We then propose a modular governance architecture. The framework decomposes oversight into four layers of \"regulatory blocks\": (i) self-regulation modules embedded beside each model, (ii) firm-level governance blocks that aggregate local telemetry and enforce policy, (iii) regulator-hosted agents that monitor sector-wide indicators for collusive or destabilizing patterns, and (iv) independent audit blocks that supply third-party assurance. Eight design strategies enable the blocks to evolve as fast as the models they police. A case study on emergent spoofing in multi-agent trading shows how the layered controls quarantine harmful behavior in real time while preserving innovation. The architecture remains compatible with today's model-risk rules yet closes critical observability and control gaps, providing a practical path toward resilient, adaptive AI governance in financial systems."}

FLFA uses the global model's weights as a shared feedback matrix during local training's backward pass, aligning local updates with the global model efficiently. This approach mitigates local drift with minimal additional computational cost and no extra communication overhead.\n  Our theoretical analysis supports FLFA's design by showing how it alleviates local drift and demonstrates robust convergence for both local and global models.

This paper introduces \"OLR-WAA: An Adaptive and Drift-Resilient Online Regression with Dynamic Weighted Average\", a hyperparameter-free model designed to tackle the challenges of non-stationary data streams and enable effective, continuous adaptation. The objective is to strike a balance between model stability and adaptability. OLR-WAA incrementally updates its base model by integrating incoming data streams, utilizing an exponentially weighted moving average. It further introduces a unique optimization mechanism that dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on real-time data characteristics. Rigorous evaluations show that it matches batch regression performance in static settings and consistently outperforms or rivals state-of-the-art online models, confirming its effectiveness. Concept drift datasets reveal a performance gap that OLR-WAA effectively bridges, setting it apart from other online models. In addition, the model effectively handles confidence-based scenarios through a conservative update strategy that prioritizes stable, high-confidence data points.

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices. The results show that ICE-based feature importance provides richer insights than the traditional PDP-based approach, while visual interpretations from PDP, ICE, and SHAP complement one another by offering multiple perspectives."}

Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces.

OLC-WA operates by blending incoming data streams with an existing base model. This blending is facilitated by an exponentially weighted moving average. Furthermore, an integrated optimization mechanism dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on the observed data stream characteristics. This approach empowers the model to effectively adapt to evolving data distributions within streaming environments. Rigorous empirical evaluation across diverse benchmark datasets shows that OLC-WA achieves performance comparable to batch models in stationary environments, maintaining accuracy within 1-3%, and surpasses leading online baselines by 10-25% under drift, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to dynamic data streams."}

We challenge this assumption by investigating the stability of safety refusal decisions across random seeds and temperature settings. Testing four instruction-tuned models from three families (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 3 8B, Gemma 3 12B) on 876 harmful prompts across 20 different sampling configurations (4 temperatures x 5 random seeds), we find that 18-28% of prompts exhibit decision flips--the model refuses in some configurations but complies in others--depending on the model. Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 44.71, p < 0.001), with mean SSI dropping from 0.951 at temperature 0.0 to 0.896 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62). These findings demonstrate that single-shot safety evaluations are insufficient for reliable safety assessment. We show that single-shot evaluation agrees with multi-sample ground truth only 92.4% of the time, and recommend using at least 3 samples per prompt for reliable safety assessment."}

Additionally, in the realm of Online Learning, ensuring statistical significance is essential to validate continuous learning processes, particularly for achieving rapid convergence and effectively managing concept drifts in a timely manner. Robust statistical methods are needed to assess the significance of performance differences as data evolves over time. This article examines the state-of-the-art online regression models and empirically evaluates several suitable tests. To compare multiple online regression models across various datasets, we employed the Friedman test along with corresponding post-hoc tests. For thorough evaluations, utilizing both real and synthetic datasets with 5-fold cross-validation and seed averaging ensures comprehensive assessment across various data subsets. Our tests generally confirmed the performance of competitive baselines as consistent with their individual reports. However, some statistical test results also indicate that there is still room for improvement in certain aspects of state-of-the-art methods."}

Our core contribution is a bound on the error between the Transformer's output for a discrete sample and its continuous-domain equivalent. We prove that for Transformers with stable positional encodings, this bound is determined by the sampling density and the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold.

Code available at https://github.com/ShanechiLab/BaRISTA", "summary": "Intracranial recordings have opened a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure activity across multiregional networks in the human brain. Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance."}

We consider a setting in which a model provider distributes trained models to multiple clients whose devices support local inference but lack the ability to retrain those models, placing the burden of performance maintenance on the provider. We introduce a model-agnostic framework that captures the interaction between resource allocation, concept drift dynamics, and deployment timing. We show that optimal training policies depend critically on the aging properties of concept durations. Under sudden concept changes, we derive optimal training policies subject to budget constraints when concept durations follow distributions with Decreasing Mean Residual Life (DMRL), and show that intuitive heuristics are provably suboptimal under Increasing Mean Residual Life (IMRL). We further study model deployment under communication constraints, prove that the associated optimization problem is quasi-convex under mild conditions, and propose a randomized scheduling strategy that achieves near-optimal client-side performance. These results offer theoretical and algorithmic foundations for cost-efficient ML model management under concept drift, with implications for continual learning, distributed inference, and adaptive ML systems."}

In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context. Our findings hold across different models and dataset sizes, far outperforming previous specialized architectures and established rotary positional embedding scaling methods."}

We investigate a potential topological constraint: when the prior distribution and target distribution have mismatched topology (e.g., unimodal to multimodal), the optimal velocity field under standard flow matching objectives may exhibit spatial discontinuities. We suggest that this discontinuity arises from the requirement that continuous flows must bifurcate to map a single mode to multiple modes, forcing particles to make discrete routing decisions at intermediate times. Through theoretical analysis on bimodal Gaussian mixtures, we demonstrate that the optimal velocity field exhibits jump discontinuities along decision boundaries, with magnitude approaching infinity as time approaches the target distribution. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to $L^2$ loss, but rather may be a consequence of topological mismatch between distributions. We validate our theory empirically and discuss potential implications for flow matching on manifolds, connecting our findings to recent work on Riemannian flow matching and the challenge of learning discontinuous representations in neural networks."}

During inference, DLMs generate text by iteratively denoising masked sequences in parallel; however, determining which positions to unmask and which tokens to commit forms a large combinatorial search problem. Existing inference methods approximate this search using heuristics, which often yield suboptimal decoding paths; other approaches instead rely on additional training to guide token selection. To introduce a principled search mechanism for DLMs inference, we introduce MEDAL, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree SEarch initialization for Diffusion LAnguage Model inference. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search at the initialization stage to explore promising unmasking trajectories, providing a robust starting point for subsequent refinement. This integration is enabled by restricting the search space to high-confidence actions and prioritizing token choices that improve model confidence over remaining masked positions. Across multiple benchmarks, MEDAL achieves up to 22.0% improvement over existing inference strategies, establishing a new paradigm for search-based inference in diffusion language models."}

We analyze the Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) of the model's gradient parameters, which quantifies the minimal number of coordinates required to describe the data points on their underlying manifold.

In this paper, a semantic distance measure based on multi-kernel Gaussian processes (MK-GP) was proposed. The latent semantic function associated with texts was modeled as a Gaussian process, with its covariance function given by a combined kernel combining Matérn and polynomial components. The kernel parameters were learned automatically from data under supervision, rather than being hand-crafted.

The framework formulates uncertainty control as a two-stage problem: the first stage selects confident samples for prediction, and the second stage applies conformal risk control on the selected subset to construct calibrated prediction sets. We develop two algorithms under this framework. The first, SCRC-T, preserves exchangeability by computing thresholds jointly over calibration and test samples, offering exact finite-sample guarantees. The second, SCRC-I, is a calibration-only variant that provides PAC-style probabilistic guarantees while being more computational efficient.

Unlike prior applications of GRPO, which have been limited to reasoning and code generation, we adapt GRPO to enforce stability of information content across groups of semantically equivalent prompts. We introduce entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards, treating prompt variants as groups and resetting conversational context to isolate phrasing effects. Experiments on investment and job recommendation tasks show that our GRPO-trained model reduces variability more effectively than fine-tuning or decoding-based baselines. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of GRPO for aligning LLMs toward information consistency, reframing variability not as an acceptable feature of generative diversity but as a correctable flaw in enterprise deployments."}

AL provides a framework that helps practitioners query informative samples for annotation by oracles (labelers). However, these labels often contain noise due to varying levels of labeler accuracy. Additionally, uncertain samples are more prone to receiving incorrect labels because of their complexity. Learning from imperfectly labeled data leads to an inaccurate classifier. We propose a novel AL framework to construct a robust classification model by minimizing noise levels. Our approach includes an assignment model that optimally assigns query points to labelers, aiming to minimize the maximum possible noise within each cycle. Additionally, we introduce a new sampling method to identify the best query points, reducing the impact of label noise on classifier performance.

To address these issues, we propose a novel universal IE paradigm, the Self-Correcting Iterative Refinement (SCIR) framework, along with a Multi-task Bilingual (Chinese-English) Self-Correcting (MBSC) dataset containing over 100,000 entries. The SCIR framework achieves plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs and IE systems through its Dual-Path Self-Correcting module and feedback-driven optimization, thereby significantly reducing training costs. Concurrently, the MBSC dataset tackles the challenge of preference alignment by indirectly distilling GPT-4's capabilities into IE result detection models. Experimental results demonstrate that SCIR outperforms state-of-the-art IE methods across three key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction, achieving a 5.27 percent average improvement in span-based Micro-F1 while reducing training costs by 87 percent compared to baseline approaches. These advancements not only enhance the flexibility and accuracy of IE systems but also pave the way for lightweight and efficient IE paradigms."}

Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches. This approach holds promise for improving the performance and robustness of brain-computer interfaces over time and for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of behavior."}

Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models."}

Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities. In both simulations and three distinct multiscale brain datasets, we show that our model can aggregate information across modalities with different timescales and distributions and missing samples to improve real-time target decoding.

Why Do Reasoning Models Loop?", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) generate long chains of thought to solve harder problems, but they often loop, repeating the same text at low temperatures or with greedy decoding. We study why this happens and what role temperature plays. With open reasoning models, we find that looping is common at low temperature. Larger models tend to loop less, and distilled students loop significantly even when their teachers rarely do. This points to mismatches between the training distribution and the learned model, which we refer to as errors in learning, as a key cause. To understand how such errors cause loops, we introduce a synthetic graph reasoning task and demonstrate two mechanisms. First, risk aversion caused by hardness of learning: when the correct progress-making action is hard to learn but an easy cyclic action is available, the model puts relatively more probability on the cyclic action and gets stuck. Second, even when there is no hardness, Transformers show an inductive bias toward temporally correlated errors, so the same few actions keep being chosen and loops appear. Higher temperature reduces looping by promoting exploration, but it does not fix the errors in learning, so generations remain much longer than necessary at high temperature; in this sense, temperature is a stopgap rather than a holistic solution. We end with a discussion of training-time interventions aimed at directly reducing errors in learning."}

TM, similar to previous paradigms, gradually transforms noise samples to data samples, however it uses a second ``internal'' generative model to implement the transition steps, making the transitions more expressive compared to diffusion and flow models. To make this paradigm tractable, TM employs a large backbone network and a smaller \"head\" module to efficiently execute the generative transition step. In this work, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation into the design, training and sampling of the head in TM frameworks, focusing on its time-continuous bidirectional variant. Through comprehensive ablations and experimentation involving training 56 different 1.7B text-to-image models (resulting in 549 unique evaluations) we evaluate the affect of the head module architecture and modeling during training as-well as a useful family of stochastic TM samplers. We analyze the impact on generation quality, training, and inference efficiency. We find that TM with an MLP head, trained with a particular time weighting and sampled with high frequency sampler provides best ranking across all metrics reaching state-of-the-art among all tested baselines, while Transformer head with sequence scaling and low frequency sampling is a runner up excelling at image aesthetics. Lastly, we believe the experiments presented highlight the design aspects that are likely to provide most quality and efficiency gains, while at the same time indicate what design choices are not likely to provide further gains."}

The current state of the scenario is assumed to be known from sensors and the prediction is taking into account various hypotheses about the behavior of traffic participants. This way, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of traffic participants can be modelled in detail. In the first part of this paper a model-based approach is presented to compute Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POG), which are introduced as a grid-based probabilistic representation of the future scenario hypotheses. However, due to the large number of possible trajectories for each traffic participant, the model-based approach comes with a very high computational load. Thus, a machine-learning approach is adopted for the computation of POGs. This work uses a novel grid-based representation of the current state of the traffic scenario and performs the mapping to POGs. This representation consists of augmented cells in an occupancy grid. The adopted machine-learning approach is based on the Random Forest algorithm. Simulations of traffic scenarios are performed to compare the machine-learning with the model-based approach. The results are promising and could enable the real-time computation of POGs for vehicle safety applications. With this detailed modelling of uncertainties, crucial components in vehicle safety systems like criticality estimation and trajectory planning can be improved."}

However, aggressive bitwidth reduction remains challenging due to activation outliers, leading to accuracy degradation. Existing methods, such as outlier-handling and group quantization, achieve high accuracy but incur substantial energy consumption. To address this, we propose SeVeDo, an energy-efficient SVD-based heterogeneous accelerator that structurally separates outlier-sensitive components into a high-precision low-rank path, while the remaining computations are executed in a low-bit residual datapath with group quantization. To further enhance efficiency, Hierarchical Group Quantization (HGQ) combines coarse-grained floating-point scaling with fine-grained shifting, effectively reducing dequantization cost. Also, SVD-guided mixed precision (SVD-MP) statically allocates higher bitwidths to precision-sensitive components identified through low-rank decomposition, thereby minimizing floating-point operation cost. Experimental results show that SeVeDo achieves a peak energy efficiency of 13.8TOPS/W, surpassing conventional designs, with 12.7TOPS/W on ViT-Base and 13.4TOPS/W on Llama2-7B benchmarks."}

However, such models often rely on millions to billions of training sequences and billions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive computational costs and significant barriers to reproducibility and accessibility, particularly for academic labs. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C. In particular, our coreset even outperforms random subsets that are ten times larger in both RNA and protein settings, revealing substantial redundancy in biological sequence datasets. These findings underscore the potential of influence-guided data pruning to substantially reduce the computational cost of BioFM pretraining, paving the way for more efficient, accessible, and sustainable biological AI research."}

Noise-based regularizers such as Dropout and DropConnect address this issue by injecting stochastic perturbations during training, but the noise they apply is typically uniform across a layer or across a batch of samples, which can suppress both harmful and beneficial co-adaptation.\n  This work introduces PerNodeDrop, a lightweight stochastic regularization method. It applies per-sample, per-node perturbations to break the uniformity of the noise injected by existing techniques, thereby allowing each node to experience input-specific variability. Hence, PerNodeDrop preserves useful co-adaptation while applying regularization. This narrows the gap between training and validation performance and improves reliability on unseen data, as evident from the experiments.\n  Although superficially similar to DropConnect, PerNodeDrop operates at the sample level. It drops weights at the sample level, not the batch level. An expected-loss analysis formalizes how its perturbations attenuate excessive co-adaptation while retaining predictive interactions. Empirical evaluations on vision, text, and audio benchmarks indicate improved generalization relative to the standard noise-based regularizer."}

We present a diagnostic study using the Amazon Computers co-purchase data to understand when and why GCNs help. Through systematic experiments with simulated label scarcity, feature ablation, and per-class analysis, we find that GCN performance depends critically on the interaction between graph homophily and feature quality. GCNs provide the largest gains under extreme label scarcity, where they leverage neighborhood structure to compensate for limited supervision. Surprisingly, GCNs can match their original performance even when node features are replaced with random noise, suggesting that structure alone carries sufficient signal on highly homophilous graphs. However, GCNs hurt performance when homophily is low and features are already strong, as noisy neighbors corrupt good predictions. Our quadrant analysis reveals that GCNs help in three of four conditions and only hurt when low homophily meets strong features. These findings offer practical guidance for practitioners deciding whether to adopt graph-based methods."}

Existing interpolation methods typically embed temporal information into individual facts to complete missing historical knowledge, while extrapolation techniques often leverage sequence models over graph snapshots to identify recurring patterns for future event prediction. These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show DynaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance. On average, compared to the second-best models, DynaGen improves the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) score by 2.61 points for interpolation and 1.45 points for extrapolation."}

Two approaches are investigated: (1) attaching a classification head to a pre-trained causal LLM and fine-tuning on the task (using the LLM's final token embedding as a sequence representation), and (2) instruction-tuning the LLM in a prompt->response format for classification. To enable single-GPU fine-tuning of models up to 8B parameters, we combine 4-bit model quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient training. Experiments on two datasets - a proprietary single-label dataset and the public WIPO-Alpha patent dataset (extreme multi-label classification) - show that the embedding-based method significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned method in F1-score, and is very competitive with - even surpassing - fine-tuned domain-specific models (e.g. BERT) on the same tasks.

This reliance adds engineering complexity and hyperparameter tuning, while also lacking a direct data-driven gradient signal, which might result in sub-optimal compression. In this paper, we introduce CoDeQ, a simple, fully differentiable method for joint pruning--quantization. Our approach builds on a key observation: the dead-zone of a scalar quantizer is equivalent to magnitude pruning, and can be used to induce sparsity directly within the quantization operator. Concretely, we parameterize the dead-zone width and learn it via backpropagation, alongside the quantization parameters. This design provides explicit control of sparsity, regularized by a single global hyperparameter, while decoupling sparsity selection from bit-width selection. The result is a method for Compression with Dead-zone Quantizer (CoDeQ) that supports both fixed-precision and mixed-precision quantization (controlled by an optional second hyperparameter). It simultaneously determines the sparsity pattern and quantization parameters in a single end-to-end optimization. Consequently, CoDeQ does not require any auxiliary procedures, making the method architecture-agnostic and straightforward to implement. On ImageNet with ResNet-18, CoDeQ reduces bit operations to ~5% while maintaining close to full precision accuracy in both fixed and mixed-precision regimes."}

We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs."}

However, MMDI relies on the Helmholtz equation, which assumes wave propagation in a uniform, homogeneous, and infinite medium. Furthermore, the use of the Laplacian operator makes MMDI highly sensitive to noise, which compromises the accuracy and reliability of stiffness estimates. In this study, we propose the Deep-Learning driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE (DIME), aimed at enhancing the robustness of inversion. DIME is trained on the displacement fields-stiffness maps pair generated through Finite Element Modelling (FEM) simulations. To capture local wave behavior and improve robustness to global image variations, DIME is trained on small image patches. We first validated DIME using homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets simulated with FEM, where DIME produced stiffness maps with low inter-pixel variability, accurate boundary delineation, and higher correlation with ground truth (GT) compared to MMDI. Next, DIME was evaluated in a realistic anatomy-informed simulated liver dataset with known GT and compared directly to MMDI. DIME reproduced ground-truth stiffness patterns with high fidelity (r = 0.99, R^2 = 0.98), while MMDI showed greater underestimation. After validating DIME on synthetic data, we tested the model in in vivo liver MRE data from eight healthy and seven fibrotic subjects. DIME preserved physiologically consistent stiffness patterns and closely matched MMDI, which showed directional bias. Overall, DIME showed higher correlation with ground truth and visually similar stiffness patterns, whereas MMDI displayed a larger bias that can potentially be attributed to directional filtering. These preliminary results highlight the feasibility of DIME for clinical applications in MRE."}

In this regard, we identify two key sources of epistemic uncertainty, namely structural uncertainty in the latent reward dependencies across arms and tasks, and user-specific uncertainty due to incomplete context and limited interaction history. To put our method into practice, we represent the joint distribution over tasks and rewards using a particle-based approximation of a log-density Gaussian process. This representation enables flexible, data-driven discovery of both inter-arm and inter-task dependencies without prior assumptions on the latent variables.

SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles.

To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings.

Instead of relying on a single feedforward pass, the model updates a recurrent reasoning token across multiple internal steps, allowing it to correct early errors and allocate computation based on input difficulty. We evaluate the LRT on Sudoku as a controlled testbed for structured reasoning and show that it achieves strong performance, reaching 98.68% digit accuracy and 36.30% full-puzzle accuracy without using symbolic rules or search. Analyzing internal patterns shows that the discard and stop gates play different, important roles in stabilizing inferences and adjusting computational depth.

Existing LLM personalization benchmarks are largely centered on two axes: accurately recalling user information and accurately applying remembered information in downstream tasks. We argue that a third axis, likability, is both subjective and central to user experience, yet under-measured by current benchmarks. To measure likability holistically, we introduce LikeBench, a multi-session, dynamic evaluation framework that measures likability across multiple dimensions by how much an LLM can adapt over time to a user's preferences to provide more likable responses. In LikeBench, the LLMs engage in conversation with a simulated user and learn preferences only from the ongoing dialogue. As the interaction unfolds, models try to adapt to responses, and after each turn, they are evaluated for likability across seven dimensions by the same simulated user. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to decompose likability into multiple diagnostic metrics: emotional adaptation, formality matching, knowledge adaptation, reference understanding, conversation length fit, humor fit, and callback, which makes it easier to pinpoint where a model falls short. To make the simulated user more realistic and discriminative, LikeBench uses fine-grained, psychologically grounded descriptive personas rather than the coarse high/low trait rating based personas used in prior work. Our benchmark shows that strong memory performance does not guarantee high likability: DeepSeek R1, with lower memory accuracy (86%, 17 facts/profile), outperformed Qwen3 by 28% on likability score despite Qwen3's higher memory accuracy (93%, 43 facts/profile). Even SOTA models like GPT-5 adapt well in short exchanges but show only limited robustness in longer, noisier interactions."}

In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze this phenomenon for geometric data, which we represent as discrete samples from a continuous source (e.g., point clouds from manifolds, graphs from graphons). Our core contribution is a bound on the error between the Transformer's output for a discrete sample and its continuous-domain equivalent. We prove that for Transformers with stable positional encodings, this bound is determined by the sampling density and the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold.

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%).

In this work, we propose a systematic evaluation framework to examine how interaction tone affects model accuracy and apply it to three recently released and widely available LLMs: GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google DeepMind), and Llama 4 Scout (Meta). Using the MMMLU benchmark, we evaluate model performance under Very Friendly, Neutral, and Very Rude prompt variants across six tasks spanning STEM and Humanities domains, and analyze pairwise accuracy differences with statistical significance testing.\n  Our results show that tone sensitivity is both model-dependent and domain-specific. Neutral or Very Friendly prompts generally yield higher accuracy than Very Rude prompts, but statistically significant effects appear only in a subset of Humanities tasks, where rude tone reduces accuracy for GPT and Llama, while Gemini remains comparatively tone-insensitive. When performance is aggregated across tasks within each domain, tone effects diminish and largely lose statistical significance. Compared with earlier researches, these findings suggest that dataset scale and coverage materially influence the detection of tone effects. Overall, our study indicates that while interaction tone can matter in specific interpretive settings, modern LLMs are broadly robust to tonal variation in typical mixed-domain use, providing practical guidance for prompt design and model selection in real-world deployments."}

The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions."}

In this work, inspired by the success of classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we explore the use of Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuanvNNs) for the multi-task peak finding problem, involving both peak counting and position estimation. We implement a simple and interpretable QuanvNN architecture that can be directly compared to its classical CNN counterpart, and evaluate its performance on a synthetic NMR-inspired dataset. Our results demonstrate that QuanvNNs outperform classical CNNs on challenging spectra, achieving an 11\\% improvement in F1 score and a 30\\% reduction in mean absolute error for peak position estimation.

We investigate a potential topological constraint: when the prior distribution and target distribution have mismatched topology (e.g., unimodal to multimodal), the optimal velocity field under standard flow matching objectives may exhibit spatial discontinuities. We suggest that this discontinuity arises from the requirement that continuous flows must bifurcate to map a single mode to multiple modes, forcing particles to make discrete routing decisions at intermediate times. Through theoretical analysis on bimodal Gaussian mixtures, we demonstrate that the optimal velocity field exhibits jump discontinuities along decision boundaries, with magnitude approaching infinity as time approaches the target distribution. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to $L^2$ loss, but rather may be a consequence of topological mismatch between distributions. We validate our theory empirically and discuss potential implications for flow matching on manifolds, connecting our findings to recent work on Riemannian flow matching and the challenge of learning discontinuous representations in neural networks."}

However, transferring knowledge effectively from one graph to another remains a critical challenge. This highlights the need for algorithms capable of applying information extracted from a source graph to an unlabeled target graph, a task known as unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA). One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains. Guided by the theoretical findings, we propose to improve GDA by decorrelating node features, which can be specifically implemented through decorrelated GCN layers and graph transformer layers. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing not only substantial performance enhancements over baseline GDA methods but also clear visualizations of small intra-class distances in the learned representations.

The technique of n-step returns is known to increase the convergence speed of RL algorithms compared to their 1-step returns-based versions. However, SAC is notoriously difficult to combine with n-step returns, since their usual combination introduces bias in off-policy algorithms due to the changes in action distribution. While this problem is solved by importance sampling, a method for estimating expected values of one distribution using samples from another distribution, importance sampling may result in numerical instability. In this work, we combine SAC with n-step returns in a way that overcomes this issue. We present an approach to applying numerically stable importance sampling with simplified hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, we analyze the entropy estimation approach of Soft Actor-Critic in the context of the n-step maximum entropy framework and formulate the $τ$-sampled entropy estimation to reduce the variance of the learning target.

To counter this threat, we propose PRIVEE (PRIvacy-preserving Vertical fEderated lEarning), a novel defense mechanism named after the French word privée, meaning \"private.\" PRIVEE obfuscates confidence scores while preserving critical properties such as relative ranking and inter-score distances. Rather than exposing raw scores, PRIVEE shares only the transformed representations, mitigating the risk of reconstruction attacks without degrading model prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show that PRIVEE achieves a threefold improvement in privacy protection compared to state-of-the-art defenses, while preserving full predictive performance against advanced feature inference attacks."}

This ensemble-based encoding is independent of chemical detail, compatible with any molecular representation and illustrated here in the homopolymer case using a minimal language model.

Yet LLMs often exhibit variability when prompts are phrased with minor differences, even when semantically equivalent. Such inconsistency undermines trust, complicates compliance, and disrupts user experience. While personalization is desirable in certain contexts, many enterprise scenarios-such as HR onboarding, customer support, or policy disclosure-require invariant information delivery regardless of phrasing or prior conversational history. Existing approaches, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and temperature tuning, improve factuality or reduce stochasticity but cannot guarantee stability across equivalent prompts. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for consistency. Unlike prior applications of GRPO, which have been limited to reasoning and code generation, we adapt GRPO to enforce stability of information content across groups of semantically equivalent prompts. We introduce entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards, treating prompt variants as groups and resetting conversational context to isolate phrasing effects. Experiments on investment and job recommendation tasks show that our GRPO-trained model reduces variability more effectively than fine-tuning or decoding-based baselines. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of GRPO for aligning LLMs toward information consistency, reframing variability not as an acceptable feature of generative diversity but as a correctable flaw in enterprise deployments."}

Deep learning enables high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts that can surpass traditional numerical models, while FL allows institutions in different locations to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, addressing efficiency and security concerns. While FL has shown promise across heterogeneous regions, its distributed nature introduces new vulnerabilities. In particular, data poisoning attacks, in which compromised clients inject manipulated training data, can degrade performance or introduce systematic biases. These threats are amplified by spatial dependencies in meteorological data, allowing localized perturbations to influence broader regions through global model aggregation. In this study, we investigate how adversarial clients distort federated surface temperature forecasts trained on the Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) dataset. We simulate geographically distributed clients and evaluate patch-based and global biasing attacks on regional temperature forecasts. Our results show that even a small fraction of poisoned clients can mislead predictions across large, spatially connected areas. A global temperature bias attack from a single compromised client shifts predictions by up to -1.7 K, while coordinated patch attacks more than triple the mean squared error and produce persistent regional anomalies exceeding +3.5 K.

AL provides a framework that helps practitioners query informative samples for annotation by oracles (labelers). However, these labels often contain noise due to varying levels of labeler accuracy. Additionally, uncertain samples are more prone to receiving incorrect labels because of their complexity. Learning from imperfectly labeled data leads to an inaccurate classifier. We propose a novel AL framework to construct a robust classification model by minimizing noise levels. Our approach includes an assignment model that optimally assigns query points to labelers, aiming to minimize the maximum possible noise within each cycle.

However, such models often rely on millions to billions of training sequences and billions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive computational costs and significant barriers to reproducibility and accessibility, particularly for academic labs. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C. In particular, our coreset even outperforms random subsets that are ten times larger in both RNA and protein settings, revealing substantial redundancy in biological sequence datasets. These findings underscore the potential of influence-guided data pruning to substantially reduce the computational cost of BioFM pretraining, paving the way for more efficient, accessible, and sustainable biological AI research."}

Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures. Empirically, our proposed framework CORE significantly outperforms MFR across node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.

This approach integrates advanced large language models and legal domain experts throughout the entire process-from raw document preprocessing, article-level alignment, to terminology extraction, mapping, and quality assurance. Unlike a single automated pipeline, our approach places greater emphasis on how human experts participate in this multi-agent system. Humans and AI agents take on different roles: AI agents handle specific, repetitive tasks, such as OCR, text segmentation, semantic alignment, and initial terminology extraction, while human experts provide crucial oversight, review, and supervise the outputs with contextual knowledge and legal judgment. We tested the effectiveness of this framework using a trilingual parallel corpus comprising 35 key Chinese statutes, along with their English and Japanese translations.

In this work, we consider a label weakening approach to generate robust retrieval models in the presence of label noise. Instead of enforcing a single, potentially erroneous label for each query document pair, we allow for a set of plausible labels derived from both the observed supervision and the model's confidence scores. We perform an extensive evaluation considering two retrieval models, one re-ranking model, considering four diverse ranking datasets. To this end, we also consider a realistic noisy setting by using a semantic-aware noise generation technique to generate different ratios of noise. Our initial results show that label weakening can improve the performance of the retrieval tasks in comparison to 10 different state-of-the-art loss functions."}

To broaden this scope, we propose learning the optimal transformation of the sampling trajectory by parameterizing stochastic interpolant (SI) schedulers. The main challenge lies in designing a parameterization that satisfies critical desiderata, including boundary conditions, differentiability, and monotonicity of the SNR. To effectively meet these requirements, we represent scheduler functions as Bézier functions, where control points naturally enforce these properties. This reduces the problem to learning an ordered set of points in the time range, while the interpretation of the points changes from ODE timesteps to Bézier control points. Across a range of pretrained diffusion and flow models, BézierFlow consistently outperforms prior timestep-learning methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of expanding the search space from discrete timesteps to Bézier-based trajectory transformations."}

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines."}

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro).

While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\\% in MDQA dataset.

As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, managing risks arising from insufficient forgetting or utility loss is increasingly crucial. Current MU techniques lack effective mechanisms for evaluating and controlling these risks, hindering the selection of strategies that appropriately balance safety and utility, and raising trust concerns surrounding the \"right to be forgotten.\" To address these issues, we propose FROC, a unified framework with Risk-Optimized Control for machine unlearning in LLMs. FROC is built around a conformal-style risk-control formulation that expresses a user-specified risk budget on unlearning behavior. This probability-based constraint enables FROC to compare MU strategies, identify feasible operating regions, and guide hyperparameter selection according to desired trade-offs between forgetting sufficiency and utility preservation. To operationalize this constraint, FROC introduces a smoothly varying continuous risk model that aggregates forgetting deficiency and utility degradation into a single configuration-level score. Building on conformal risk analysis, FROC computes (1) the Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR), a data-driven estimated value on the probability that forgotten samples continue to influence model predictions, and (2) risk-controlled configuration sets, which identify unlearning hyperparameters that are valid under the specified risk budget. Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact. FROC reframes MU as a controllable, risk-aware process and offers a practical foundation for managing unlearning behavior in large-scale LLM deployments."}

CASP blocks utilize multi-headed channel- and self-attention for aggregation and sequential information delivery. Additionally, we propose a task-specialized Gradient Dropout (GD) technique to enable many-to-many training on single labels, preventing biased feedback surges by stochastically blocking gradient flow based on sample length. Experiments on 5-year AIS data demonstrate WAY's superiority over conventional spatial grid-based approaches regardless of trajectory progression. Results further confirm that adopting GD leads to performance gains. Finally, we explore WAY's potential for real-world application through multitask learning for ETA estimation."}

However, high computational demands, complex incentive mechanisms, and disparities in client-side computing power often lead to long times and higher costs. To address these challenges, many existing methods rely on server-side knowledge distillation that solely removes the updates of the target client, overlooking the privacy embedded in the contributions of other clients, which can lead to privacy leakage. In this work, we introduce DPUL, a novel server-side unlearning method that deeply unlearns all influential weights to prevent privacy pitfalls. Our approach comprises three components: (i) identifying high-weight parameters by filtering client update magnitudes, and rolling them back to ensure deep removal. (ii) leveraging the variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and eliminate low-weight parameters. (iii) utilizing a projection-based technique to recover the model. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that DPUL surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, providing a 1%-5% improvement in accuracy and up to 12x reduction in time cost."}

However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \\(1 - \\max(P_{\\mathrm{target}})\\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks."}

Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures. Empirically, our proposed framework CORE significantly outperforms MFR across node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results. In particular, CORE surpasses GraphMAE and GraphMAE2 by up to 2.80% and 3.72% on node classification tasks, and by up to 3.82% and 3.76% on graph classification tasks."}

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines."}

Formally, $C_T$ is defined as the cumulative Fisher-Rao path length of the coupled learner-environment evolution, measuring the total distributional motion accumulated during learning. From this construct we derive a drift-feedback generalization bound of order $O(T^{-1/2} + C_T/T)$, and we prove a matching minimax lower bound showing that this rate is minimax-optimal. Consequently, the results establish a reproducibility speed limit: no algorithm can achieve smaller worst-case generalization error than that imposed by the average Fisher-Rao drift rate $C_T/T$ of the data-generating process.

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode.

This challenges interpretability, yet we lack principled methods to measure superposition. We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many \"virtual neurons\" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime). By defining superposition as lossy compression, this work enables principled measurement of how neural networks organize information under computational constraints, connecting superposition to adversarial robustness."}

However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, naïve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate.

As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence."}

Learning-based approaches to dimensionality reduction, utilizing neural networks and autoencoders, have shown great potential to alleviate this problem. However, ensuring the correctness of the resulting verification results remains an open question. In this work, we provide a formal approach to reduce the dimensionality of systems via convex autoencoders and learn the dynamics in the latent space through a kernel-based method. We then construct a finite abstraction from the learned model in the latent space and guarantee that the abstraction contains the true behaviors of the original system. We show that the verification results in the latent space can be mapped back to the original system. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple systems, including a 26D system controlled by a neural network, showing significant scalability improvements without loss of rigor."}

This challenges interpretability, yet we lack principled methods to measure superposition. We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many \"virtual neurons\" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime). By defining superposition as lossy compression, this work enables principled measurement of how neural networks organize information under computational constraints, connecting superposition to adversarial robustness."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce StutterFuse, the first Retrieval-Augmented Classifier (RAC) for multi-label stuttering detection. By conditioning a Conformer encoder on a non-parametric memory bank of clinical examples, we allow the model to classify by reference rather than memorization. We further identify and solve \"Modality Collapse\", an \"Echo Chamber\" effect where naive retrieval boosts recall but degrades precision. We mitigate this using: (1) SetCon, a Jaccard-Weighted Metric Learning objective that optimizes for multi-label set similarity, and (2) a Gated Mixture-of-Experts fusion strategy that dynamically arbitrates between acoustic evidence and retrieved context.

While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup."}

In this work, we propose cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) to develop general-purpose reasoning models, Nemotron-Cascade, capable of operating in both instruct and deep thinking modes. Departing from conventional approaches that blend heterogeneous prompts from different domains, Cascade RL orchestrates sequential, domain-wise RL, reducing engineering complexity and delivering state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, RLHF for alignment, when used as a pre-step, boosts the model's reasoning ability far beyond mere preference optimization, and subsequent domain-wise RLVR stages rarely degrade the benchmark performance attained in earlier domains and may even improve it (see an illustration in Figure 1).

We propose Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), which fixes the embedding magnitude to an in-distribution scale and optimizes only direction on the unit hypersphere via Riemannian SGD. We cast direction learning as MAP with a von Mises-Fisher prior, yielding a constant-direction prior gradient that is simple and efficient to incorporate. Across personalization tasks, DTI improves text fidelity over TI and TI-variants while maintaining subject similarity. Crucially, DTI's hyperspherical parameterization enables smooth, semantically coherent interpolation between learned concepts (slerp), a capability that is absent in standard TI.

We perform a deep dive into a classification task based on United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decisions.

Although educational resources are burgeoning, educators face challenges selecting materials that both align with intended learning outcomes and address diverse learner needs. Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting growing interest for their potential to create learning resources that better support personalization, but verifying coverage of intended outcomes still requires human alignment review, which is costly and limits scalability. We propose a framework that supports the cost-effective automation of evaluating alignment between educational resources and intended learning outcomes. Using human-generated materials, we benchmarked LLM-based text-embedding models and found that the most accurate model (Voyage) achieved 79% accuracy in detecting alignment. We then applied the optimal model to LLM-generated resources and, via expert evaluation, confirmed that it reliably assessed correspondence to intended outcomes (83% accuracy). Finally, in a three-group experiment with 360 learners, higher alignment scores were positively related to greater learning performance, chi-squared(2, N = 360) = 15.39, p < 0.001.

The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents."}

Building on the narrative policy framework and existing research on authoritarian propaganda, we propose two dimensions that shape narrative construction: legitimacy implications -- whether events enhance or threaten regime legitimacy, and citizen verification capacity -- the extent to which citizens can evaluate official narratives through alternative sources. Using quantitative narrative analysis of Chinese social media posts by government, state media, and celebrity accounts, we extract subject-verb-object (SVO) triplets to map dominant narrative structures across four major events. Our findings show that legitimacy implications of the event shape regime's efforts in storytelling and the beliefs highlighted in the narratives, while citizen's verification capacity could balance the strategic choice between a top-down manipulation and bottom-up responsiveness of state narratives. Together, the results reveal propaganda as a complex process of narrative construction adaptive to specific contexts, offering new insights into how dynamic storytelling sustains authoritarian resilience."}

Our first set of experiments find a suitable model for the task to imitate player demonstrations, using Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning: combining Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, and Proximal Policy Optimization. The second set of experiments evaluates the constructed model with player tests, where models are trained on demonstrations provided by participants.

Fisher's objective function is generalised to consider simultaneously the contributions of the centres and the ranges of intervals and is numerically maximised. The resulting discriminant directions are then used to classify interval-valued observations.To support visual assessment, we adapt the class map, originally introduced for conventional data, to classifiers that assign labels through minimum distance rules. We also extend the silhouette plot to this setting and use stacked mosaic plots to complement the visual display of class assignments. Together, these graphical tools provide insight into classifier performance and the strength of class membership. Applications to real datasets illustrate the proposed methodology and demonstrate its value in interpreting classification results for interval-valued data."}

The forecasting is conducted using daily data from the S and P 500 index, covering the period from January 1 1998 to December 31 2024.

Thus, finding ways to optimize their estimation is of great importance. We extend the application of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to the estimation of 10-day 97.5% ES and stressed ES, building on prior work applying DBNs to value at risk. Using the S&P 500 index as a proxy for the equities trading desk of a US bank, we compare the performance of three DBN structure-learning algorithms with several traditional market risk models, using either the normal or the skewed Student's t return distributions. Backtesting shows that all models fail to produce statistically accurate ES and SES forecasts at the 2.5% level, reflecting the difficulty of modeling extreme tail behavior. For ES, the EGARCH(1,1) model (normal) produces the most accurate forecasts, while, for SES, the GARCH(1,1) model (normal) performs best. All distribution-dependent models deteriorate substantially when using the skewed Student's t distribution. The DBNs perform comparably to the historical simulation model, but their contribution to tail prediction is limited by the small weight assigned to their one-day-ahead forecasts within the return distribution. Future research should examine weighting schemes that enhance the influence of forward-looking DBN forecasts on tail risk estimation."}

Current methodologies are predominantly confined to deducing a singular graph under the presumption that the observed data are uniform. However, many contexts involve heterogeneous datasets that feature multiple closely related graphs, typically referred to as multiview graphs. Previous research on multiview graph learning promotes edge-based similarity across layers using pairwise or consensus-based regularizers. However, multiview graphs frequently exhibit a shared node-based architecture across different views, such as common hub nodes. Such commonalities can enhance the precision of learning and provide interpretive insight. In this paper, we propose a co-hub node model, positing that different views share a common group of hub nodes. The associated optimization framework is developed by enforcing structured sparsity on the connections of these co-hub nodes. Moreover, we present a theoretical examination of layer identifiability and determine bounds on estimation error. The proposed methodology is validated using both synthetic graph data and fMRI time series data from multiple subjects to discern several closely related graphs."}

Gaussian process regression (GPR) models are a natural way to model data with Gaussian-distributed uncertainties. GPR also has the benefit of reducing I/O bandwidth and storage requirements for large scientific simulations. However, the reconstruction from the GPR models suffers from high computation complexity. To make the situation worse, classic approaches for visualizing the data uncertainties, like probabilistic marching cubes, are also computationally very expensive, especially for data of high resolutions. In this paper, we accelerate the level-crossing probability calculation efficiency on GPR models by subdividing the data spatially into a hierarchical data structure and only reconstructing values adaptively in the regions that have a non-zero probability. For each region, leveraging the known GPR kernel and the saved data observations, we propose a novel approach to efficiently calculate an upper bound for the level-crossing probability inside the region and use this upper bound to make the subdivision and reconstruction decisions. We demonstrate that our value occurrence probability estimation is accurate with a low computation cost by experiments that calculate the level-crossing probability fields on different datasets."}

Recent advances in modern machine learning have revealed a more complex pattern, double-descent, in which test loss, after peaking near the interpolation threshold, decreases again as model capacity continues to grow. While this behavior has been extensively analyzed in regression and classification, its manifestation in survival analysis remains unexplored. This study investigates double-descent in four representative survival models: DeepSurv, PC-Hazard, Nnet-Survival, and N-MTLR. We rigorously define interpolation and finite-norm interpolation, two key characteristics of loss-based models to understand double-descent. We then show the existence (or absence) of (finite-norm) interpolation of all four models. Our findings clarify how likelihood-based losses and model implementation jointly determine the feasibility of interpolation and show that overfitting should not be regarded as benign for survival models. All theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments that highlight the distinct generalization behaviors of survival models."}

Existing methods often rely on pairwise connections, neglecting high-order dependencies among multiple entities and relations, and they treat structural and semantic signals independently, hindering effective cross-modal integration. To address these challenges, we propose MetaHGNIE, a meta-path induced hypergraph contrastive learning framework for disentangling and aligning structural and semantic information. MetaHGNIE constructs a higher-order knowledge graph via meta-path sequences, where typed hyperedges capture multi-entity relational contexts. Structural dependencies are aggregated with local attention, while semantic representations are encoded through a hypergraph transformer equipped with sparse chunking to reduce redundancy. Finally, a multimodal fusion module integrates structural and semantic embeddings under contrastive learning with auxiliary supervision, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark NIE datasets demonstrate that MetaHGNIE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Existing approaches treat editing as generic text generation, leading to two key failures: they struggle to faithfully align edits with diverse user intents, and they often over-edit unchanged regions. We propose HyperEdit to address both issues. First, we introduce hypernetwork-based dynamic adaptation that generates request-specific parameters, enabling the model to tailor its editing strategy to each instruction. Second, we develop difference-aware regularization that focuses supervision on modified spans, preventing over-editing while ensuring precise, minimal changes. HyperEdit achieves a 9%--30% relative improvement in BLEU on modified regions over state-of-the-art baselines, despite utilizing only 3B parameters."}

This paper focuses on DRO with ambiguity sets defined via the Sinkhorn discrepancy: an entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance, referred to as Sinkhorn DRO. Existing work primarily addresses Sinkhorn DRO from a dual perspective, leveraging its formulation as a conditional stochastic optimization problem, for which many stochastic gradient methods are applicable. However, the theoretical analyses of such methods often rely on the boundedness of the loss function, and it is indirect to obtain the worst-case distribution associated with Sinkhorn DRO. In contrast, we study Sinkhorn DRO from the primal perspective, by reformulating it as a bilevel program with several infinite-dimensional lower-level subproblems over probability space. This formulation enables us to simultaneously obtain the optimal robust decision and the worst-case distribution, which is valuable in practical settings, such as generating stress-test scenarios or designing robust learning algorithms. We propose both double-loop and single-loop sampling-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees to solve this bilevel program.

Although Gaussian process models excel at capturing smooth nonlinear relationships, their stationarity assumptions limit their ability to adapt to sudden input-output variations. Existing nonstationary extensions, particularly those based on domain partitioning, often struggle with boundary inconsistencies, sensitivity to outliers, and scalability issues in higher-dimensional settings, leading to reduced predictive accuracy and unreliable parameter estimation.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Robust Local Gaussian Process (RLGP) model, a framework that integrates adaptive nearest-neighbor selection with a sparsity-driven robustification mechanism. Unlike existing methods, RLGP leverages an optimization-based mean-shift adjustment after a multivariate perspective transformation combined with local neighborhood modeling to mitigate the influence of outliers. This approach improves predictive accuracy near discontinuities while enhancing robustness to data heterogeneity.\n  Comprehensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that RLGP consistently delivers high predictive accuracy and maintains competitive computational efficiency, especially in scenarios with sharp transitions and complex response structures. Scalability tests further confirm RLGP's stability and reliability in higher-dimensional settings, where other methods struggle. These results establish RLGP as an effective and practical solution for modeling nonstationary and discontinuous response surfaces across a wide range of applications."}

Project page: https://kagnlp.github.io/WebOperator/", "summary": "LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

To address this, this paper proposes an end-to-end decision-focused framework that jointly optimizes probabilistic forecasting and robust operation for microgrids. A multilayer encoder-decoder (MED) probabilistic forecasting model is integrated with a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model involving direct load control (DLC) through a differentiable decision pathway, enabling gradient-based feedback from operational outcomes to improve forecasting performance. Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations. The results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the end-to-end decision-focused approach for resilient and cost-efficient microgrid management under uncertainty."}

The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions."}

This paper introduces the Memory-Aware Retention Schema (MaRS), a novel framework for human-centered memory management in generative agents, coupled with six theoretically-grounded forgetting policies that balance performance, privacy, and computational efficiency. We present the Forgetful but Faithful Agent (FiFA) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses agent performance across narrative coherence, goal completion, social recall accuracy, privacy preservation, and cost efficiency. Through extensive experimentation involving 300 evaluation runs across multiple memory budgets and agent configurations, we demonstrate that our hybrid forgetting policy achieves superior performance (composite score: 0.911) while maintaining computational tractability and privacy guarantees. Our work establishes new benchmarks for memory-budgeted agent evaluation and provides practical guidelines for deploying generative agents in resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive environments.

We study this through questions from MedQA, where the task is to select the most likely diagnosis. We introduce the Frequency-Based Probabilistic Ranker (FBPR), a lightweight method that scores options with a smoothed Naive Bayes over concept-diagnosis co-occurrence statistics from a large corpus. When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization. While the performance of LLMs seems to be driven by a mechanism other than simple frequency aggregation, we show that an approach similar to the historically grounded, low-complexity expert systems still accounts for a substantial portion of benchmark performance."}

We first propose a PAC-Bayes bound for multivariate linear regression, extending the earlier bound for single-output linear regression by Shalaeva et al., and establish sufficient conditions for its convergence. We then show that LAEs, when evaluated under a relaxed mean squared error, can be interpreted as constrained multivariate linear regression models on bounded data, to which our bound adapts. Furthermore, we develop theoretical methods to improve the computational efficiency of optimizing the LAE bound, enabling its practical evaluation on large models and real-world datasets.

We introduce a framework for OOD detection that is simultaneously model aware and subspace aware, and that embeds variable prioritization directly into the detection step. The method uses the fitted predictor to construct localized neighborhoods around each test case that emphasize the features driving the model's learned relationship and downweight directions that are less relevant to prediction. It produces OOD scores without relying on global distance metrics or estimating the full feature density. The framework is applicable across outcome types, and in our implementation we use random forests, where the rule structure yields transparent neighborhoods and effective scoring. Experiments on synthetic and real data benchmarks designed to isolate functional shifts show consistent improvements over existing methods. We further demonstrate the approach in an esophageal cancer survival study, where distribution shifts related to lymphadenectomy identify patterns relevant to surgical guidelines."}

We develop an anytime-valid, data-dependent upper confidence sequence for the weighted average suboptimality of projected SGD, constructed via nonnegative supermartingales and requiring no smoothness or strong convexity. This confidence sequence yields a simple stopping rule that is provably $\\varepsilon$-optimal with probability at least $1-α$ and is almost surely finite under standard stochastic approximation stepsizes.

Recently, a new class of stochastic momentum algorithms has emerged within the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework--leading to state-of-the-art methods, such as Muon, Scion, and Gluon, that effectively solve deep neural network training problems. However, traditional stochastic momentum methods offer convergence guarantees no better than the ${O}(1/K^{1/4})$ rate. While several approaches--such as Hessian-Corrected Momentum (HCM)--have aimed to improve this rate, their theoretical results are generally restricted to the Euclidean norm setting. This limitation hinders their applicability in problems, where arbitrary norms are often required. In this paper, we extend the LMO-based framework by integrating HCM, and provide convergence guarantees under relaxed smoothness and arbitrary norm settings. We establish improved convergence rates of ${O}(1/K^{1/3})$ for HCM, which can adapt to the geometry of the problem and achieve a faster rate than traditional momentum.

This leads to slow and unstable convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm. RPO uses external models to identify hallucination sources and generate concise reflective hints, enabling the construction of on-policy preference pairs with stronger contrastiveness and clearer preference signals. We theoretically show that conditioning on hints increases the expected preference margin through mutual information and improves sample efficiency while remaining within the policy distribution family. Empirically, RPO achieves superior alignment with fewer training samples and iterations, substantially reducing hallucination rates and delivering state-of-the-art performance across multimodal benchmarks."}

In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations.

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control."}

While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup."}

This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions.

When the data is drawn from an isotropic Gaussian mixture distribution, it is known that the evolution of a finite family of summary statistics under stochastic gradient descent converges to an autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE), as the dimension and sample size go to $\\infty$ and the step size goes to $0$ commensurately. Our main result is that these ODE limits are universal in that this convergence occurs even when the data is drawn from mixtures of product measures provided the first two moments match the corresponding Gaussian distribution and the initialization and ground truth vectors are sufficiently coordinate-delocalized. We complement this by proving two corresponding non-universality results. We provide a simple example where the ODE limits are non-universal if the initialization is coordinate aligned. We also show that the stochastic differential equation limits arising as fluctuations of the summary statistics around their ODE's fixed points are not universal."}
