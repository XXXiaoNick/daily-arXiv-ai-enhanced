Second, conformity thresholds vary by model:\nGemini 1.5 Flash requires over 70% peer disagreement to flip, whereas\nChatGPT-4o-mini shifts with a dissenting minority. Third, we uncover a\nfundamental \"persuasion asymmetry,\" where shifting an opinion from\naffirmative-to-negative requires a different cognitive effort than the reverse.\nThis asymmetry results in a \"dual cognitive hierarchy\": the stability of\ncognitive constructs inverts based on the direction of persuasion. For\ninstance, affirmatively-held core values are robust against opposition but\neasily adopted from a negative stance, a pattern that inverts for other\nconstructs like attitudes. These dynamics echoing complex human biases like\nnegativity bias, prove robust across different topics and discursive frames\n(moral, economic, sociotropic).

This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are\ncapable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was\ncreated to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning\n(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,\nexperimentation, and prototyping.\n  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference\nlatency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the\ninference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and\ncheckpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa\nmodels, with the intention of extending future work to include models of\ndifferent modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's\ncapabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and\nmore accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem."}

Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as\npath, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic\nPAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that\ndevelopers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility."}

Through controlled post-training\nexperiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,\nand Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -\nthe relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on\nmodel capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples\nat different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task\ndemands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final\nrepresentations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate\ninternal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the\nnotion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across\nmodel and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing\ndecision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes."}

Our methodology is divided into two\nphases. First, an \\emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs\nmonolithic experts into fine-grained \"sub-experts.\" This engine employs a\npartitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to\ngroup neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.\nSecond, an \\emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity\nthrough QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve\ncomplex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments\nand managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our\nevaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over\n4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health\nmonitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute\nSpearman's $\\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with\nan absolute Spearman's $\\rho$ of $0.95$.

Although large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by\nreinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the\nmulti-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this\npaper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization\nstrategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward\nprocess in RL by using the hypervolume method.

Accordingly, this work\ncompares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion\ndetection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned\npre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)\neffectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact\nof emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain\nmetrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.\nMoreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt\nengineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These\nadvancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and\nunderstanding of user behavior across various domains."}

As a result, information that\nlarge language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by\nhumans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced\ninformation: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order\nto decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find\nthat LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as\nclosely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from\nvigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that\nboosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the\ncorrespondence between LLMs and the rational model.

The framework combines high-resolution feature\nlearning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by\nan autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.\nStochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.\nEvaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed\nstatistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble\nmethods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over\nextended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets\nenhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular\nor biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and\nuncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid\nescalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources."}

This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are\ncapable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was\ncreated to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning\n(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,\nexperimentation, and prototyping.\n  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference\nlatency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the\ninference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and\ncheckpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa\nmodels, with the intention of extending future work to include models of\ndifferent modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's\ncapabilities.

As a result, information that\nlarge language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by\nhumans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced\ninformation: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order\nto decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find\nthat LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as\nclosely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from\nvigilance-relevant considerations.

If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant\ncorrelation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the\nnull hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the\nquery setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model\ngives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of\nover 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to\n12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value\non the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational\nsetting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's\ntext overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood\nof Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by\nrepeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The\nsecond approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few\nhundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many\nmore tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power."}

Many practical\nchallenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including\nthe considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial\ncomputational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven\nmethods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a\ntypical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of\nmultiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the\nsampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events\nbut with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To\novercome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or\n$\\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the\navailable data. $\\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted'\nextreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an\nobservable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available\nthrough qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data.

In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems.

However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the\n''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their\ncurrent capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent\nzero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses\nthe advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible\nto the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce\nScaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive\ntraining framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a\nmodel's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses\nlearning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,\nranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to\nconstruct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging\nmathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the\npass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative\n44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework\nprovides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to\nsolve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending\nthe frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM."}

Hubble models come in standard\nand perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English\ncorpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled\ninsertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to\nemulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard\nand perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B\ntokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency\nof sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password\nappearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password\nin a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text\ninserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without\ncontinued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices\nfor addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the\nsize of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in\ntraining. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range\nof memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how\nreadily different types of private information are memorized. We also\ndemonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed\nfor membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to\nfurther explore, benchmark, and build upon our work."}
