TL;DR: Omnilingual ASR是一个可扩展的大规模语音识别系统，通过7B参数的自监督预训练和编码器-解码器架构，实现了仅需少量样本即可支持新语言的零样本泛化能力，覆盖了1600多种语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高资源语言ASR技术发展迅速而全球7000多种语言中大多数缺乏支持的问题，特别是长尾语言被忽视的现状，同时避免传统扩展方法的高成本和伦理问题。

Method: 采用7B参数的自监督预训练学习鲁棒语音表示，引入编码器-解码器架构和LLM启发的解码器实现零样本泛化，结合公共资源和社区合作收集的多样化训练语料。

Result: 系统覆盖1600多种语言（其中500多种首次获得ASR支持），在低资源条件下相比先前系统有显著提升，表现出强大的泛化能力，并发布了从300M到7B的不同规模模型。

Conclusion: 开源模型和工具可以降低研究者和社区的门槛，促进新的参与形式，同时强调了设计中的伦理考量和社会影响。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has advanced in high-resource languages, but most of the world's 7,000+ languages remain unsupported, leaving thousands of long-tail languages behind. Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation. Open-source artifacts are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/omnilingual-asr.

### [2] [Order Matters: Rethinking Prompt Construction in In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09700)
*Warren Li,Yiqian Wang,Zihan Wang,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现示例顺序对上下文学习性能的影响与示例选择相当，挑战了之前认为示例选择更重要的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视上下文学习中示例选择和排序的相对重要性，因为之前研究普遍认为示例选择的影响远大于排序。

Method: 在分类和生成任务上进行受控实验，使用多个开源模型家族（0.5B到27B参数）和GPT-5，系统比较示例选择和排序对性能的影响。

Result: 不同示例排序导致的性能差异与使用完全不同示例集相当；使用开发集可以识别强排序，性能接近基于测试标签选择最佳排序的oracle方法。

Conclusion: 示例选择和排序在提示设计中具有同等且相互交织的重要性，需要重新审视上下文学习中的假设。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to perform new tasks by conditioning on a sequence of examples. Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels. Our findings highlight the equal and intertwined importance of example selection and ordering in prompt design, calling for a reexamination of the assumptions held in ICL.

### [3] [Contextual morphologically-guided tokenization for Latin encoder models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09709)
*Marisa Hudspeth,Patrick J. Burns,Brendan O'Connor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了针对拉丁语的形态感知分词方法，发现形态学指导的分词能提升下游任务性能，特别是在领域外文本上表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词方法通常优先考虑信息理论目标而非语言学目标，对形态丰富的语言效果不佳。拉丁语作为形态丰富的语言，具有中等规模的预训练数据但丰富的词典资源，这为研究形态感知分词提供了机会。

Method: 采用形态学指导的分词方法，利用拉丁语丰富的词典资源来改进分词过程。

Result: 在四个下游任务上，形态感知分词提高了整体性能，特别是在领域外文本上表现最为显著，显示出改进的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 对于缺乏大规模预训练数据的低资源语言，开发和整合语言资源可以作为提高语言模型性能的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of language model pretraining, yet standard tokenization methods often prioritize information-theoretical goals like high compression and low fertility rather than linguistic goals like morphological alignment. In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages. For low-resource languages that lack large-scale pretraining data, the development and incorporation of linguistic resources can serve as a feasible alternative to improve LM performance.

*C. LeMay,A. Lane,J. Seales,M. Winstead,S. Baty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了NLP在从里根到克林顿政府时期的总统指令中提取主要主题的应用，发现NLP与人工分析在识别相关文档方面具有潜力，但也存在差异，需要进一步验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索NLP在处理大规模文本语料库中的效用，特别是在识别总统指令中的信号主题方面，以评估NLP在社会科学研究中的应用价值。

Method: 使用自然语言处理技术从里根到克林顿政府的总统指令语料库中提取主要主题，并与分析师的人工标注结果进行比较分析。

Result: NLP和人工分析都能识别相关文档，但两者结果存在差异，表明需要更多研究来验证NLP在此类应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: 虽然NLP在处理大规模文本语料方面显示出潜力，但由于AI/ML技术的快速发展，现有工具可能已过时，需要持续评估和改进NLP在社会科学研究中的应用。

Abstract: Our research investigates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to extract main topics from a larger corpus of written data, as applied to the case of identifying signaling themes in Presidential Directives (PDs) from the Reagan through Clinton administrations. Analysts and NLP both identified relevant documents, demonstrating the potential utility of NLPs in research involving large written corpuses. However, we also identified discrepancies between NLP and human-labeled results that indicate a need for more research to assess the validity of NLP in this use case. The research was conducted in 2023, and the rapidly evolving landscape of AIML means existing tools have improved and new tools have been developed; this research displays the inherent capabilities of a potentially dated AI tool in emerging social science applications.

### [5] [How Small Can You Go? Compact Language Models for On-Device Critical Error Detection in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09748)
*Muskaan Chopra,Lorenz Sparrenberg,Sarthak Khanna,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现约10亿参数的轻量级语言模型在机器翻译关键错误检测任务中能达到最佳质量效率平衡，其中Gemma-3-1B表现最佳，在保持低计算成本的同时实现高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在机器翻译评估方面表现出色，但其规模和成本限制了在边缘设备和隐私敏感工作流中的部署，需要探索更小规模的可行方案。

Method: 基准测试了多个小于20亿参数的模型，采用标准化提示、轻量级logit-bias校准和多数投票方法，评估语义质量和计算指标。

Result: Gemma-3-1B在质量效率权衡方面表现最佳，在SynCED-EnDe-2025数据集上达到MCC=0.77和F1-ERR=0.98，同时在MacBook Pro M4 Pro上保持400ms的单样本延迟。

Conclusion: 紧凑的指令调优LLM结合轻量级校准和小样本监督可以提供可信赖的本地化关键错误检测，实现私有、低成本的实时翻译错误筛查。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at evaluating machine translation (MT), but their scale and cost hinder deployment on edge devices and in privacy-sensitive workflows. We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines. All datasets, prompts, and scripts are publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [6] [Predicate-Argument Structure Divergences in Chinese and English Parallel Sentences and their Impact on Language Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09796)
*Rocco Tripodi,Xiaoyu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了中英文平行句子中的谓词-论元结构，发现语言迁移具有不对称性，源语言的选择对跨语言NLP应用至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言NLP在低资源场景中具有重要价值，但语言差异（特别是类型学距离较远的语言）阻碍了语言迁移效果。本文旨在分析中英文谓词-论元结构的对齐与不对齐情况。

Method: 通过注释投影实验，分别以中文和英文作为源语言，将注释投影到对应的平行句子中，进行定性和定量分析，并提出结构差异的分类方法。

Result: 分析结果显示语言迁移具有明显的不对称性，源语言的选择对迁移效果产生显著影响。

Conclusion: 在跨语言NLP应用中，源语言的选择需要谨慎考虑，任何关于跨语言NLP的科学论断都需要先进行充分调查。

Abstract: Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained significant traction in recent years, offering practical solutions in low-resource settings by transferring linguistic knowledge from resource-rich to low-resource languages. This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric. An aspect that requires attention when it comes to selecting the source language in transfer learning applications and that needs to be investigated before any scientific claim about cross-lingual NLP is proposed.

### [7] [TARG: Training-Free Adaptive Retrieval Gating for Efficient RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09803)
*Yufeng Wang,Lu wei,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TARG是一种无需训练的自适应检索门控方法，通过基础模型的短文本草稿计算轻量级不确定性分数，仅在分数超过阈值时触发检索，显著减少检索次数和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成(RAG)虽然提高了事实准确性，但为每个查询都进行检索会降低质量、增加token数量和延迟。需要一种智能的检索触发机制来平衡准确性和效率。

Method: 从基础模型的短文本草稿中提取前缀logits，计算三种轻量级不确定性分数：平均token熵、基于top-1/top-2 logit差距的边际信号，或少量随机前缀的小N方差。仅当分数超过阈值时触发检索。

Result: 在NQ-Open、TriviaQA和PopQA数据集上，TARG相比Always-RAG在保持或提高EM/F1的同时，减少了70-90%的检索次数，降低了端到端延迟，且开销接近Never-RAG。

Conclusion: 边际信号是现代指令调优LLM下的稳健默认选择，小N方差提供了保守的预算优先替代方案。TARG无需额外训练，模型无关，有效平衡了准确性和效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factuality but retrieving for every query often hurts quality while inflating tokens and latency. We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.

### [8] [Khmer Spellchecking: A Holistic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09812)
*Marry Kong,Rina Buoy,Sovisal Chenda,Nguonly Taing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成高棉语子词分割、命名实体识别、字形到音素转换和语言模型的整体拼写检查方法，解决了高棉语拼写检查的独特挑战，准确率达到94.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高棉语拼写检查面临词典与分词模型不对齐、单词有多种书写形式、复合词灵活多变且不在词典中、专有名词被误判为拼写错误等独特挑战，现有解决方案无法充分解决这些问题。

Method: 采用整体方法，集成高棉语子词分割、命名实体识别、字形到音素转换和语言模型，识别潜在修正候选词并排序最佳候选。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法达到了最先进的高棉语拼写检查准确率94.4%，优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的整体方法有效解决了高棉语拼写检查的独特挑战，并创建了公开可用的高棉语拼写检查和命名实体识别基准数据集。

Abstract: Compared to English and other high-resource languages, spellchecking for Khmer remains an unresolved problem due to several challenges. First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions. The benchmark datasets for Khmer spellchecking and NER tasks in this study will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学生选择相关课程的挑战，弥合大学学习与行业期望之间的差距

Method: 使用数据挖掘和协同过滤技术分析历史课程和个人职业目标，结合机器学习算法构建推荐框架，并通过迭代原型设计和用户反馈优化前端界面

Result: 开发了一个易于使用的前端界面，具有视觉清晰度和交互性，通过用户反馈不断优化系统性能

Conclusion: 该课程推荐系统能够帮助学生做出基于数据和行业信息的课程决策，促进终身学习和职业发展，提高大学毕业生成果

Abstract: This paper aims to address the challenge of selecting relevant courses for students by proposing the design and development of a course recommendation system. The course recommendation system utilises a combination of data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms to recommend courses that align with current industry trends and requirements. In order to provide customised suggestions, the study entails the design and implementation of an extensive algorithmic framework that combines machine learning methods, user preferences, and academic criteria. The system employs data mining and collaborative filtering techniques to examine past courses and individual career goals in order to provide course recommendations. Moreover, to improve the accessibility and usefulness of the recommendation system, special attention is given to the development of an easy-to-use front-end interface. The front-end design prioritises visual clarity, interaction, and simplicity through iterative prototyping and user input revisions, guaranteeing a smooth and captivating user experience. We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations. We hope that the proposed course recommendation system will help university students in making data-drive and industry-informed course decisions, in turn, improving graduate outcomes for the university sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程论坛中学生问题数量增加导致响应延迟和重复问题，需要自动化问答系统来减轻教师负担

Result: 在HotpotQA数据集上的实验结果表明，微调后的LLM结合RAG方法在问答任务上表现优异

Conclusion: 基于RAG的微调大语言模型能有效解决课程论坛问答问题，减少教师负担并提高响应效率

Abstract: The course forums are increasingly significant and play vital role in facilitating student discussions and answering their questions related to the course. It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG method has a strong performance on question answering task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TermGPT是一个多级对比微调框架，通过构建句子图和多级对比学习来解决LLM在专业术语表示上的各向同性问题，在金融和法律领域的术语区分任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域（如法律和金融）的术语级表示存在各向同性问题，导致对领域特定术语的区分能力不足，这严重影响了下游任务如法律判决预测和金融风险分析的性能。

Method: 提出TermGPT框架：1）构建句子图捕捉语义和结构关系，基于上下文和拓扑线索生成语义一致但具有区分性的正负样本；2）设计句子级和词元级的多级对比学习方法，增强全局上下文理解和细粒度术语区分能力。

Result: 构建了首个基于官方监管文件的金融术语数据集，实验表明TermGPT在金融和法律领域的术语区分任务中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: TermGPT通过多级对比学习有效解决了LLM在专业术语表示上的局限性，为领域特定的下游任务提供了更好的术语级表示能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in text generation tasks; however, their embedding spaces often suffer from the isotropy problem, resulting in poor discrimination of domain-specific terminology, particularly in legal and financial contexts. This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents. Experiments show that TermGPT outperforms existing baselines in term discrimination tasks within the finance and legal domains.

*Mingye Zhu,Yi Liu,Zheren Fu,Quan Wang,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InTRO是一个新的框架，通过令牌级探索和自我反馈来解决大型语言模型在思维链推理中的训练挑战，避免了单一黄金答案的局限性和强化学习的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在训练LLMs进行思维链推理时存在两个问题：监督微调惩罚了同样有效的替代推理路径，而强化学习在信用分配和计算成本方面存在困难。

Method: InTRO利用修正因子（基于生成策略与其答案条件对应策略之间的信息差异估计的令牌级重要性权重）来进行信息丰富的下一个令牌选择，实现令牌级探索和自我反馈。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，InTRO始终优于其他基线方法，相对于基础模型将解决方案准确率提高了高达20%，并且生成的思维链更加简洁。

Conclusion: InTRO不仅提高了推理准确性，还实现了跨领域迁移，成功适应了数学领域之外的其他推理任务，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for chain-of-thought reasoning presents a significant challenge: supervised fine-tuning on a single "golden" rationale hurts generalization as it penalizes equally valid alternatives, whereas reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards struggles with credit assignment and prohibitive computational cost. To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HierRouter是一种分层路由方法，通过动态组装轻量级专用语言模型来提升LLM推理性能，同时控制计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能优异，但计算和内存成本高昂，限制了在资源受限或实时场景中的部署。

Method: 将问题建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，训练基于PPO的强化学习代理在多跳推理的每个阶段选择要调用的模型。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，HierRouter相比独立使用单个模型将响应质量提升了最高2.4倍，同时仅产生最小的额外推理成本。

Conclusion: 分层路由方法为成本高效、高性能的LLM推理提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance across many tasks but impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained or real-time settings. To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average. These results highlight the promise of hierarchical routing for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference. All codes can be found here https://github.com/ Nikunj-Gupta/hierouter.

Conclusion: 迫切需要能够支持公平、位置感知AI系统的语言模型，能够参与不同地理和文化背景下本地社区的多样化、细粒度现实。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.

TL;DR: EnchTable是一个新颖框架，通过NTK-based安全向量蒸馏和干扰感知合并技术，在微调LLMs时保持安全对齐，避免安全性能退化，同时维持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs微调过程中的安全对齐系统性退化问题，防止有害输出并维护伦理准则。

Method: 使用基于神经切线核(NTK)的安全向量蒸馏方法解耦安全约束与任务推理，结合干扰感知合并技术平衡安全性和实用性。

Result: 在11个数据集上的评估显示，EnchTable实现了更低的不安全率、更高的效用分数，对静态和动态越狱攻击具有鲁棒性，优于供应商发布的安全模型。

Conclusion: EnchTable能够在不显著增加开销的情况下，有效维护LLMs的安全对齐，具有通用性和部署友好性。

Abstract: Many machine learning models are fine-tuned from large language models (LLMs) to achieve high performance in specialized domains like code generation, biomedical analysis, and mathematical problem solving. However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains. Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.

Abstract: To provide a unified and flexible solution for daily communication among hearing-impaired individuals, we introduce the Omni-Model paradigm into assistive technology and present HI-TransPA, an instruction-driven audio-visual personal assistant. The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion. Experiments on our purpose-built HI-Dialogue dataset show that HI-TransPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both literal accuracy and semantic fidelity. This work establishes a foundation for applying Omni-Models to assistive communication technology, providing an end-to-end modeling framework and essential processing tools for future research.

Conclusion: Norm-RAG框架能够有效处理多语言对话中的社会规范推理，为构建更智能的对话系统提供了新方法。

Abstract: Social norms are implicit, culturally grounded expectations that guide interpersonal communication. Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression. Our experiments show that Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrates improved performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.

TL;DR: 本研究通过结合LLM自动生成知识组件和基于余弦相似度的语义合并技术，解决了传统手动识别知识组件的瓶颈问题，显著提升了自适应学习系统的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识组件是自适应学习系统的基础，但手动识别存在效率瓶颈。虽然大语言模型提供了自动化可能，但先前研究存在数据集小、生成标签冗余的问题。

Method: 首先使用GPT-4o-mini在646个选择题数据集上扩展"模拟教科书"提示策略，然后提出基于余弦相似度的语义相似知识组件标签合并方法。

Result: 初始LLM方法表现差于专家设计模型，生成569个知识组件。使用余弦相似度阈值0.8的合并策略后，知识组件数量降至428个，RMSE提升至0.4259。

Conclusion: 单纯扩展LLM生成不足够，但结合语义合并技术可为知识组件自动识别和优化提供可行路径。

Abstract: Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.

Conclusion: REAP方法通过结构化子任务管理和全局知识表示，有效提升了多跳推理任务的可靠性和可追溯性，在复杂推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been extensively employed to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public multi-hop datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, validating its effectiveness in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型任务中表现出色，但在数值推理方面存在困难，需要系统评估其在数值声明和证据对上的真实性预测能力及鲁棒性。

Method: 使用受控扰动（包括标签翻转探针）对最先进模型进行系统性评估，测试其在数值声明和证据对上的真实性预测鲁棒性。

Result: 所有模型在特定扰动下准确率显著下降（最高达62%），没有模型在所有条件下都稳健。增加上下文长度通常降低准确性，但用扰动演示丰富扩展上下文后，大多数模型能显著恢复性能。

Conclusion: 数值事实核查存在关键局限性，鲁棒性仍是当前语言模型面临的开放挑战。

Abstract: Large language models show strong performance on knowledge intensive tasks such as fact-checking and question answering, yet they often struggle with numerical reasoning. We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models for veracity prediction on numerical claims and evidence pairs using controlled perturbations, including label-flipping probes, to test robustness. Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover. These findings highlight critical limitations in numerical fact-checking and suggest that robustness remains an open challenge for current language models.

Conclusion: 趋势感知的不确定性建模能产生更有效的检索时机，ETC方法具有鲁棒泛化能力，易于集成到现有解码流程中

Abstract: Dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to fetch external knowledge on demand, offering greater adaptability than static RAG. A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines. Implementation code is included in the supplementary materials.

Conclusion: SCD为多语言RAG中的语言漂移问题提供了一种轻量级、无需训练的有效解决方案，能显著改善跨语言生成的语言对齐和任务性能。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge-intensive tasks in multilingual settings by leveraging retrieved documents as external evidence. However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.
  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.

Method: 构建FinNuE诊断数据集，通过控制数值扰动的方式，在财报电话会议、监管文件、社交媒体和新闻文章等金融文本中测试BERTScore的性能。

Result: BERTScore无法区分语义关键的数值差异，经常为财务上截然不同的文本对分配高相似度分数，暴露了基于嵌入的指标在金融应用中的根本局限性。

Conclusion: 基于嵌入的评估指标在金融NLP中存在根本性限制，需要开发数值感知的评估框架来准确评估金融文本的语义相似性。

Abstract: BERTScore has become a widely adopted metric for evaluating semantic similarity between natural language sentences. However, we identify a critical limitation: BERTScore exhibits low sensitivity to numerical variation, a significant weakness in finance where numerical precision directly affects meaning (e.g., distinguishing a 2% gain from a 20% loss). We introduce FinNuE, a diagnostic dataset constructed with controlled numerical perturbations across earnings calls, regulatory filings, social media, and news articles. Using FinNuE, demonstrate that BERTScore fails to distinguish semantically critical numerical differences, often assigning high similarity scores to financially divergent text pairs. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations of embedding-based metrics for finance and motivate numerically-aware evaluation frameworks for financial NLP.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.

Conclusion: ScaleFormer提供了一种简单有效的方法，使预训练模型能够有效推理长文本，实现线性复杂度并保持文档叙事流程的强信号。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of standard self-attention severely limits the application of Transformer-based models to long-context tasks. While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text. Experiments on long-document summarization show that our method is highly competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without requiring architectural modifications or external retrieval mechanisms.

Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型如何解释人类语言中的听觉信息，特别是语音象征性这一非任意性语音-意义关联现象。

Method: 使用LEX-ICON数据集（包含4种自然语言的8,052个单词和2,930个伪词），通过文本（正字法和IPA）和听觉输入形式，在25个语义维度上分析模型的层间信息处理，测量音素级注意力分数。

Conclusion: 该研究在人工智能和认知语言学之间架起桥梁，首次提供了关于MLLMs可解释性方面语音象征性的大规模定量分析。

Abstract: Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.

Result: 在两个长多轮对话数据集上的广泛实验表明，GraphIF可以无缝集成到指令调优的LLMs中，并在所有四个多轮指令跟随评估指标上带来显著改进。

Conclusion: GraphIF框架成功地将图结构引入多轮指令跟随任务，证明了利用图提示增强LLMs多轮对话能力的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We present ADI-20, an extension of the previously published ADI-17 Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) dataset. ADI-20 covers all Arabic-speaking countries' dialects. It comprises 3,556 hours from 19 Arabic dialects in addition to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We used this dataset to train and evaluate various state-of-the-art ADI systems. We explored fine-tuning pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN-based models, as well as Whisper encoder blocks coupled with an attention pooling layer and a classification dense layer. We investigated the effect of (i) training data size and (ii) the model's number of parameters on identification performance. Our results show a small decrease in F1 score while using only 30% of the original training data. We open-source our collected data and trained models to enable the reproduction of our work, as well as support further research in ADI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估多模态大语言模型在科学声明验证中的表现，发现模型在表格证据上表现较好，但在图表证据上表现较差，且小模型在跨模态泛化方面存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着科学论文数量增加，需要系统辅助评审员评估研究声明。当前多模态LLMs在不同证据格式（表格和图表）下验证科学声明的鲁棒性仍是一个重要但未被充分探索的挑战。

Method: 通过改编两个现有科学论文数据集，加入多模态声明验证任务所需的注释和结构，评估12个多模态LLMs在表格和图表证据上的表现，并进行人工评估对比。

Result: 当前模型在表格证据上表现更好，在图表证据上表现较差；人类在两种格式上均表现良好；小于8B的多模态LLMs在表格和图表任务间表现相关性弱，跨模态泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前模型的多模态推理能力存在关键差距，未来多模态LLMs应更注重改进图表理解能力以更好地支持科学声明验证。

Abstract: With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.

Motivation: 社交媒体已成为监控灾难事件的重要工具，但现有系统存在事件相关偏差问题，影响对新兴事件的泛化能力

Method: 通过因果视角减少事件和领域相关偏差，提升对未来事件的泛化性能

Result: 在三个灾难分类任务中，方法比多个基线高出最多+1.9% F1分数，并显著改善了基于预训练语言模型的分类器

Conclusion: 基于因果学习的偏差缓解方法能有效提升灾难事件分类系统的泛化能力

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of social media platforms, these tools have become essential for monitoring information during ongoing disaster events. However, extracting valuable insights requires real-time processing of vast amounts of data. A major challenge in existing systems is their exposure to event-related biases, which negatively affects their ability to generalize to emerging events. While recent advancements in debiasing and causal learning offer promising solutions, they remain underexplored in the disaster event domain. In this work, we approach bias mitigation through a causal lens and propose a method to reduce event- and domain-related biases, enhancing generalization to future events. Our approach outperforms multiple baselines by up to +1.9% F1 and significantly improves a PLM-based classifier across three disaster classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮交互中的推理过程分析面临复杂上下文依赖和缺乏专门可视化工具的挑战，导致研究人员认知负荷高。

Method: 开发VISTA系统，支持可视化上下文对模型决策的影响、交互式修改对话历史进行"假设"分析，以及自动解析会话生成推理依赖树。

Result: VISTA显著降低了推理链分析的复杂性，提供了对LLM能力和局限性的更深入理解。

Conclusion: VISTA通过统一交互框架促进了对LLM推理过程的理解，平台开源且支持自定义基准和本地模型集成。

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn interactions, as these scenarios more closely mirror real-world problem-solving. However, analyzing the intricate reasoning processes within these interactions presents a significant challenge due to complex contextual dependencies and a lack of specialized visualization tools, leading to a high cognitive load for researchers. To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct "what-if" analyses across different models. Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path. By providing a unified and interactive framework, VISTA significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing reasoning chains, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs. The platform is open-source and supports easy integration of custom benchmarks and local models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Text-to-SQL领域因数据稀缺、简单且多样性不足而导致的性能瓶颈问题，推动数据为中心的AI范式发展。

Method: 设计六维数据增强框架，包含SQL执行验证、自然语言问题生成、思维链推理跟踪和数据分类，采用模块化数据库管理器确保跨数据库兼容性和可扩展性。

Result: 构建了高质量的SQLFlow数据集，在开源LLM微调和闭源LLM的掩码对齐检索方法中均取得显著性能提升，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 建立了可扩展的数据中心化基础，强调了高质量结构化数据在现代AI中的关键作用，为Text-to-SQL系统的进步提供了有力支撑。

Abstract: The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用思维链提示时往往产生不必要的冗长解释，增加了成本并可能降低准确性，且现有评估方法碎片化，缺乏统一标准。

Method: 构建EffiReason-Bench基准测试，包含经过验证的思维链标注，涵盖数学、常识和逻辑推理数据集，并提出E3-Score评估指标来平滑稳定地评估效率与准确性的权衡。

Result: 实验评估了7种方法在6个开源LLM上的表现，发现没有单一方法在所有情况下都最优，最佳策略取决于模型规模、任务复杂度和架构。

Conclusion: 高效推理方法的选择需要根据具体场景定制，EffiReason-Bench为跨范式评估提供了统一标准，E3-Score提供了更稳定的评估指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting achieve strong reasoning but often produce unnecessarily long explanations, increasing cost and sometimes reducing accuracy. Fair comparison of efficiency-oriented approaches is hindered by fragmented evaluation practices. We introduce EffiReason-Bench, a unified benchmark for rigorous cross-paradigm evaluation of efficient reasoning methods across three categories: Reasoning Blueprints, Dynamic Execution, and Post-hoc Refinement. To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics. Experiments show that no single method universally dominates; optimal strategies depend on backbone scale, task complexity, and architecture.

TL;DR: 提出了PAL框架，通过将角色对齐作为训练目标，采用两阶段训练方法，在语义层面生成更相关的个性化对话回复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流模型依赖token级语言模型训练，倾向于忽略给定角色信息并生成通用回复，需要改进角色敏感性。

Method: 两阶段训练：角色感知学习和角色对齐，配备选择后生成的推理策略，在语义层面提升角色相关性。

Result: 实验表明该框架优于许多最先进的个性化对话方法和大型语言模型。

Conclusion: PAL框架通过直接优化角色对齐目标，有效提升了对话生成的角色相关性和一致性。

Abstract: Personalized dialogue generation aims to leverage persona profiles and dialogue history to generate persona-relevant and consistent responses. Mainstream models typically rely on token-level language model training with persona dialogue data, such as Next Token Prediction, to implicitly achieve personalization, making these methods tend to neglect the given personas and generate generic responses. To address this issue, we propose a novel Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL), which directly treats persona alignment as the training objective of dialogue generation. Specifically, PAL employs a two-stage training method including Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, equipped with an easy-to-use inference strategy Select then Generate, to improve persona sensitivity and generate more persona-relevant responses at the semantics level. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms many state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言数据选择方法通常忽略了数据的固有语言结构，导致多语言能力对训练数据的组成和选择高度敏感。

Method: 提出LangGPS框架：首先基于可分离性分数过滤训练数据，然后使用现有选择方法精炼子集。可分离性量化了不同语言样本在模型表示空间中的可区分程度。

Result: 在6个基准测试和22种语言上的实验表明，LangGPS能提高现有选择方法的有效性和泛化能力，特别是在理解任务和低资源语言上。分析发现高可分离性样本促进清晰语言边界的形成，低可分离性样本则作为跨语言对齐的桥梁。

Conclusion: 语言可分离性可作为多语言课程学习的有效信号，交错使用不同可分离性水平的样本能带来稳定且可泛化的收益，为多语言环境下的数据效用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Joint multilingual instruction tuning is a widely adopted approach to improve the multilingual instruction-following ability and downstream performance of large language models (LLMs), but the resulting multilingual capability remains highly sensitive to the composition and selection of the training data. Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.

Motivation: 当前端到端口语语言模型存在显著响应延迟问题，主要源于自回归生成语音token和复杂流匹配模型的使用。

Method: 提出VocalNet-M2模型，集成多码本分词器和多token预测策略，直接生成多码本语音token，无需流匹配模型。

Result: 实验显示VocalNet-M2大幅降低首块延迟至350ms，同时在主流SLM中保持竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发高效高性能实时交互SLM提供了有价值见解，并全面比较了单码本和多码本策略。

Abstract: Current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have made notable progress, yet they still encounter considerable response latency. This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

Method: 通过将连续的全双工对话分割为离散的轮次，构建MTR-DuplexBench基准，实现对全双工语音语言模型在对话质量、对话动态、指令遵循和安全性等方面的全面轮次评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前的全双工语音语言模型在保持多轮和多个评估维度上的一致性表现方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 提出的基准在评估全双工语音语言模型方面具有必要性和有效性，基准和代码将在未来发布。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

Conclusion: 隐私和性能在企业AI部署中不必相互排斥，组织可以在保持数据本地化的同时获得强大的问答能力。

Abstract: Organizations handling sensitive documents face a critical dilemma: adopt cloud-based AI systems that offer powerful question-answering capabilities but compromise data privacy, or maintain local processing that ensures security but delivers poor accuracy. We present a question-answering system that resolves this trade-off by combining semantic understanding with keyword precision, operating entirely on local infrastructure without internet access. Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines. By balancing two complementary retrieval strategies and using consumer-grade hardware acceleration, the system delivers reliable answers with minimal errors, letting banks, hospitals, and law firms adopt conversational document AI without transmitting proprietary information to external providers. This work establishes that privacy and performance need not be mutually exclusive in enterprise AI deployment.

Conclusion: 不平衡评估偏好是LLMs批判能力差的重要原因，通过困惑度感知强化学习可以有效纠正这种偏好，提升批判性能。

Abstract: To improve Multi-step Mathematical Reasoning (MsMR) of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to obtain scalable supervision from the corpus by automatically critiquing mistakes in the reasoning process of MsMR and rendering a final verdict of the problem-solution. Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.

Abstract: In the context of pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data has emerged as an alternative for generating high-quality pretraining data at scale. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models. Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts. Empirical results through model runs reveal key trade-offs in generation strategies and highlight best practices for constructing effective multilingual corpora.

TL;DR: ATR4CH是一个用于从文化遗产文本中提取知识的五步方法，结合LLM和本体框架，在真实性评估案例中验证有效，F1分数0.62-0.99，小模型表现竞争力强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产文本包含丰富知识，但由于将非结构化话语转换为结构化知识图谱的挑战，难以系统查询。

Method: 五步方法：基础分析、注释模式开发、管道架构、集成优化和全面评估。使用三个LLM（Claude Sonnet 3.7、Llama 3.3 70B、GPT-4o-mini）的顺序管道。

Result: 成功提取复杂文化遗产知识：元数据提取F1 0.96-0.99，实体识别F1 0.7-0.8，假设提取F1 0.65-0.75，证据提取F1 0.95-0.97，话语表示G-EVAL 0.62。小模型表现竞争力强。

Conclusion: ATR4CH是首个系统协调LLM提取与文化遗产本体的方法，提供可复现框架，支持文化遗产机构将文本知识转换为可查询知识图谱。

Abstract: Cultural Heritage texts contain rich knowledge that is difficult to query systematically due to the challenges of converting unstructured discourse into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.

*Shuyi Liu,Yuming Shang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TruthfulRAG是一个利用知识图谱解决RAG系统中事实级知识冲突的框架，通过构建知识图谱、图检索和熵过滤机制来精确定位冲突元素，提高生成内容的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在解决检索外部信息与LLM内部知识冲突时，通常只在token或语义层面操作，导致对事实差异的理解零散不完整，特别是在知识密集型任务中。

Method: 构建知识图谱（从检索内容中系统提取三元组），使用基于查询的图检索识别相关知识，并采用基于熵的过滤机制精确定位冲突元素。

Result: 大量实验表明TruthfulRAG优于现有方法，有效缓解知识冲突，提高RAG系统的鲁棒性和可信度。

Conclusion: TruthfulRAG是首个利用知识图谱解决RAG系统中事实级知识冲突的框架，能够生成更忠实和准确的响应。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval-based methods with generative models. As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.

*Jason Chan,Zhixue Zhao,Robert Gaizauskas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文认为评估基础LLM的推理能力存在方法论问题，因为基础LLM的预训练目标与推理评估的规范性质量存在根本性不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究评估基础LLM的推理能力来揭示其局限性、人类偏见和底层过程，但忽视了方法论上的根本问题。

Method: 通过分析基础LLM预训练目标与推理评估标准之间的不匹配，展示基础LLM生成逻辑有效或无效结论只是语言统计模式符合度的副产品。

Result: 发现基础LLM的输出不能被视为其真实尝试正确回答或得出结论，且关于基础LLM推理的结论不能推广到经过指令优化的后训练LLM。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新审视依赖这些假设的现有研究，并建议未来工作考虑这些方法论陷阱。

Abstract: Existing work investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to uncover their limitations, human-like biases and underlying processes. Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.

TL;DR: 提出了DELICATE方法，一种结合BERT编码器和Wikidata上下文信息的神经符号方法，用于历史意大利语的实体链接，并在ENEIDE语料库上验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言处理中实体链接在人文学科领域的挑战，包括复杂文档类型、缺乏领域特定数据集和模型、以及知识库中代表性不足的长尾实体问题。

Method: DELICATE方法结合BERT编码器与Wikidata的上下文信息，使用时序合理性和实体类型一致性来选择适当的KB实体。ENEIDE语料库是从19至20世纪的文学和政治文本中半自动提取的多领域历史意大利语EL语料。

Result: DELICATE在历史意大利语实体链接任务中优于其他模型，即使与具有数十亿参数的大型架构相比。其置信度分数和特征敏感性提供了比纯神经方法更可解释和可理解的结果。

Conclusion: DELICATE方法有效解决了历史意大利语实体链接的挑战，提供了高性能且可解释的解决方案，ENEIDE语料库为领域研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In spite of the remarkable advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing, the task of Entity Linking (EL) remains challenging in the field of humanities due to complex document typologies, lack of domain-specific datasets and models, and long-tail entities, i.e., entities under-represented in Knowledge Bases (KBs). The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters. Moreover, further analyses reveal how DELICATE confidence scores and features sensitivity provide results which are more explainable and interpretable than purely neural methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于类比范式组织的计算方法，通过少量结构化数据训练轻量级模型，在英语致使/起始交替任务上达到F1=0.95，超越了GPT-3的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否通过类比范式组织，可以让轻量级模型在极少数据下达到与大型语言模型相当的性能。

Method: 采用三种认知启发原则：类比结构、对比学习和最小上下文线索，在结构化补全任务中训练轻量级模型。

Result: 仅用100个结构化示例训练BERT+CNN模型（50万参数），在英语致使/起始交替任务上达到F1=0.95，优于GPT-3的零样本性能（F1=0.87）。消融研究证实类比组织和对比结构能提升性能。

Conclusion: 类比范式组织能够以比传统方法少几个数量级的数据实现具有竞争力的语言规则学习。

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance through training on vast datasets. Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$). Ablation studies confirm that analogical organization and contrastive structure improve performance, consistently surpassing randomly shuffled baselines across architectures. Cross-phenomenon validation using unspecified object alternations replicates these efficiency gains, confirming approach robustness. Our results show that analogical paradigm organization enables competitive linguistic rule learning with orders of magnitude less data than conventional approaches require.

TL;DR: 提出一种针对模糊请求生成多个解释-答案对的方法，通过强化学习和定制奖励函数训练模型，在单次生成中覆盖更多有效答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在回应模糊请求时通常只隐含承诺一种解释，这种意图误解会使用户感到沮丧并带来安全风险。

Method: 使用强化学习和定制奖励函数训练模型，以多个有效答案作为监督，在单个结构化响应中生成多个解释-答案对。

Result: 在对话问答和语义解析任务上的实验表明，该方法比基线方法实现了更高的有效答案覆盖率。人工评估确认预测解释与答案高度一致。

Conclusion: 该方法通过明确解释提高透明度，通过单次生成实现效率，并通过结构化输出格式支持下游应用。

Abstract: Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在状态跟踪任务中的能力，将状态跟踪组件与其他因素隔离进行分析。

Method: 提出了基于三个明确定义的状态跟踪任务的基准测试，分析LLMs在不同场景下的表现，包括使用思维链等机制。

Result: 新一代LLMs（GPT-4和Llama3）能够跟踪状态，特别是结合思维链机制时；老一代模型在初始阶段能理解任务，但在一定步骤后会失败。

Conclusion: 最近一代的大型语言模型在状态跟踪任务中表现出色，而老一代模型在此类任务中存在局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks, including those requiring a certain level of reasoning. In this paper, we focus on state tracking, a problem where models need to keep track of the state governing a number of entities. To isolate the state tracking component from other factors, we propose a benchmark based on three well-defined state tracking tasks and analyse the performance of LLMs in different scenarios. The results indicate that the recent generation of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4 and Llama3) are capable of tracking state, especially when integrated with mechanisms such as Chain of Thought. However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.

TL;DR: KPPO是一个基于知识供给的提示优化框架，通过系统性的知识整合而非潜在能力激发来优化提示，在知识密集型任务中显著优于基于激发的传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注激发模型能力，但在知识密集型任务中存在根本性局限，因为它们无法提供所需的事实知识、术语精确性和推理模式。

Method: KPPO框架包含三个关键创新：1）知识缺口填补机制；2）批量候选评估方法；3）自适应知识剪枝策略，平衡性能和token效率。

Result: 在15个知识密集型基准测试中，KPPO相比最强基线平均性能提升约6%，同时token使用量减少高达29%。

Conclusion: KPPO证明了将提示优化重新定义为知识整合而非能力激发的有效性，为知识密集型任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: While prompt optimization has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing language model performance, existing approaches primarily focus on elicitation-based strategies that search for optimal prompts to activate models' capabilities. These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Conclusion: 评分标准是训练和评估大语言模型高级指令遵循能力的有效工具，为开发更强大可靠的AI系统铺平道路

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advanced instruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了语言风格作为攻击面如何影响LLM的安全性，发现通过恐惧、好奇等风格重构有害意图可显著提升越狱成功率，并提出风格中和预处理方法来缓解此漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全评估主要关注语义等价的越狱提示，但忽视了语言风格变化作为攻击面的潜在风险，需要系统研究风格重构对模型安全性的影响。

Method: 构建风格增强的越狱基准，将3个标准数据集中的提示转换为11种不同语言风格，使用手工模板和LLM重写保持语义意图，评估16个开源和闭源模型，并引入风格中和预处理方法。

Result: 风格重构使越狱成功率最高提升57个百分点，恐惧、好奇和同情等风格最有效，情境化重写优于模板变体，风格中和预处理显著降低了越狱成功率。

Conclusion: 语言风格重构是一个被当前安全流程忽视的系统性且难以通过规模扩展解决的漏洞，需要专门的防御措施来应对这种攻击面。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

Motivation: 现有对话记忆评估基准存在统计能力不足、数据生成不一致和评估灵活性有限等问题，需要更全面的评估框架来理解对话记忆与RAG系统的关系。

Method: 构建包含用户事实、助手回忆、弃权、偏好、时间变化和隐式连接等多样类别的综合基准，比较简单全上下文方法与复杂RAG系统在不同对话长度下的表现。

Result: 简单全上下文方法在最具挑战性的多消息证据案例中达到70-82%准确率，而复杂RAG系统如Mem0在150次对话内仅达到30-45%准确率。长上下文在前30次对话中表现最佳，在150次对话内仍可行，之后需要混合或RAG方法。

Conclusion: 对话记忆的小语料优势值得专门研究，不应简单将通用RAG解决方案应用于对话历史，需要针对对话记忆特性开发专用方法。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for conversational memory evaluation containing 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.

Motivation: 探讨类型作为形式分类而非制度分类的有效性，理解文学小说与类型小说之间的形式差异，以及作者性别如何影响文学分类。

Method: 使用CONLIT数据集构建文学小说和类型小说语料库，采用Welch's ANOVA比较叙事特征分布，使用逻辑回归建模特征对文学分类的影响，分析风格和语义向量表示。

Result: 发现每个文学类别具有统计学上显著的形式标记，女性作者身份会缩小和模糊获得文学地位的目标标准。

Conclusion: 类型确实具有形式上的区分特征，但作者性别在文学分类中起着重要的调节作用，女性作者面临更严格的文学地位评判标准。

Abstract: Though the concept of genre has been a subject of discussion for millennia, the relatively recent emergence of genre fiction has added a new layer to this ongoing conversation. While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有MLLMs在长文档理解中的两个核心问题：大量无关内容的信息干扰，以及Transformer架构的二次计算成本。现有方法要么牺牲细节精度，要么增加系统复杂度。

Method: 提出URaG框架，引入轻量级跨模态检索模块，将早期Transformer层转换为高效证据选择器，识别并保留最相关页面，让深层专注于相关信息。

Result: 在广泛实验中，URaG实现了最先进的性能，同时将计算开销降低了44-56%。

Conclusion: URaG证明了MLLMs固有的证据定位能力可以显式地用于推理过程中的检索，为高效长文档理解提供了简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with long document understanding due to two fundamental challenges: information interference from abundant irrelevant content, and the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based architectures. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%. The code is available at https://github.com/shi-yx/URaG.

Motivation: 现有的ASTE方法在准确捕捉方面、观点和情感极性之间的关系方面仍面临挑战，特别是BERT和图神经网络尚未充分发挥先进语言模型在理解复杂语言模式方面的潜力。

Method: 提出DESS框架，集成DeBERTa的增强注意力机制与LSTM通道，构建双通道结构分别处理文本语义和语法模式，并精心优化组件间的协作方式。

Result: 在标准数据集测试中，DESS在识别方面观点对和准确确定情感方面比现有方法有明显改进，F1分数分别提升了4.85、8.36和2.42。DeBERTa的复杂注意力系统帮助模型更好地处理复杂句子结构，特别是当重要词汇相距较远时。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经过精心集成，升级到更先进的语言模型可以显著提升文本情感分析的性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis faces ongoing challenges in Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), particularly in accurately capturing the relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/VishalRepos/DESS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确提取医患对话中的医疗订单对于减轻临床文档负担和确保患者安全至关重要，本文旨在探索领域特定开源语言模型MedGemma在此任务中的性能。

Method: 系统评估了三种不同的提示范式：直接的单样本方法、推理导向的ReAct框架和多步骤智能体工作流程。

Result: 实验表明，虽然ReAct和智能体流程等复杂框架功能强大，但简单的单样本提示方法在官方验证集上取得了最高性能。

Conclusion: 在手动标注的转录本上，复杂的推理链可能导致"过度思考"并引入噪声，因此直接方法更加稳健高效。这项工作为在不同数据条件下选择合适的临床信息提取提示策略提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对MEDIQA-WV 2025共享任务，提出了两种互补方法：基于挖掘提示的策略和基于元数据消融研究的生成方法，旨在提高伤口护理查询的AI响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步远程护理的快速发展增加了医护人员的工作负担，需要AI系统来帮助更有效地管理患者查询，特别是在伤口护理这种需要结合图像和文本的场景中。

Method: 1. 挖掘提示策略：嵌入训练数据并检索最相似的top-k示例作为少样本演示；2. 元数据引导生成：通过消融研究识别出四个能提升响应质量的元数据属性，训练分类器预测这些属性并动态调整生成过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，挖掘提示策略提高了响应相关性，而元数据引导生成进一步提升了临床精确度。

Conclusion: 这两种方法为开发能够提供可靠高效伤口护理支持的AI驱动工具指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.

*Benjamin L. Badger,Matthew Neligeorge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了编码器增强的因果解码器模型架构，该架构在训练效率上优于因果变换器，并能实现更高的压缩率。研究表明，接近但不超出估计的每词元熵值的因果模型比不考虑熵的模型具有更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最有效的语言压缩算法是基于因果（下一个词元预测）的大型语言模型，但使用这些模型准确估计语言熵在计算上不可行。本文旨在通过新的模型架构更高效地估计语言熵，并探索熵与模型泛化能力之间的关系。

Method: 引入编码器增强的因果解码器模型架构，该架构在训练效率上优于因果变换器。通过该架构获得每词元熵的估计，并训练模型接近但不超出估计的熵值。

Result: 编码器增强的因果解码器模型在适度硬件上训练时，比因果变换器实现更高的压缩率。实验表明，接近但不超出估计每词元熵值的因果模型比不考虑熵的模型具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语言预测受到语言内在信息熵的限制，存在语言模型准确性的上限和语言压缩的下界。通过编码器增强的因果解码器架构可以更高效地估计熵，且训练模型接近但不超出估计熵值能提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSR是一个新颖的LLM推理框架，通过将模型响应分解为可验证的子问题-子答案对，实现细粒度评估和精确优化，在多个推理基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时框架依赖粗略的自验证和自校正，限制了在复杂任务上的有效性，需要更精细的推理评估和优化方法。

Method: 将模型响应分解为可验证的子问题-子答案对，通过受控重解和自一致性检查进行步骤级置信度估计，精确定位不可靠步骤并迭代优化。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试和三个LLM上的实证结果显示，SSR始终优于最先进的迭代自优化基线方法。

Conclusion: SSR不仅提供性能提升，还为评估和理解LLM内部推理过程提供了原则性的黑盒方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet existing test-time frameworks often rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting their effectiveness on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.

TL;DR: Instella是一个完全开源的30亿参数语言模型家族，使用公开数据和代码库训练，在AMD MI300X GPU上开发，在完全开源模型中达到最先进水平，并发布了支持128K上下文长度的Instella-Long和数学推理增强的Instella-Math两个变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数高性能语言模型都是闭源或部分开源的，限制了透明度和可复现性，需要开发完全开源的高性能模型来推进开放和可复现的语言建模研究。

Method: 使用AMD Instinct MI300X GPU进行大规模预训练、通用指令微调以及与人类偏好对齐；为特定任务开发了支持长上下文的Instella-Long和通过监督微调与强化学习增强数学推理的Instella-Math。

Result: 尽管使用的预训练token数量远少于同期模型，Instella在完全开源模型中达到最先进水平，并与同规模领先的开源权重模型具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Instella系列模型为社区提供了透明、高性能且多功能的替代方案，推进了开放和可复现语言建模研究的目标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet the majority of high-performing models remain closed-source or partially open, limiting transparency and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce Instella, a family of fully open three billion parameter language models trained entirely on openly available data and codebase. Powered by AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs, Instella is developed through large-scale pre-training, general-purpose instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries, Instella achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open models and is competitive with leading open-weight models of comparable size. We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出生成对抗蒸馏(GAD)方法，通过将学生LLM作为生成器、训练判别器区分师生模型响应，实现黑盒蒸馏，在LMSYS-Chat评估中Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct学生模型表现接近GPT-5-Chat教师模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒蒸馏问题，即仅从专有教师模型的文本输出学习，无法访问其内部逻辑或参数。

Method: 将学生LLM作为生成器，训练判别器区分学生和教师模型的响应，形成极小极大博弈，判别器作为策略奖励模型与学生共同演化。

Result: GAD持续超越常用的序列级知识蒸馏，Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct学生模型在LMSYS-Chat自动评估中表现与GPT-5-Chat教师模型相当。

Conclusion: GAD是黑盒LLM蒸馏的一个有前景且有效的范式。

Abstract: Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParoQuant是一种仅权重的训练后量化方法，通过成对旋转量化和通道缩放来抑制异常值，减少量化误差，在推理任务上比AWQ平均提升2.4%准确率，且开销低于10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型权重和激活中的异常值会导致量化误差和精度下降，特别是在推理任务中误差会在长思维链中累积。现有方法要么无法充分抑制异常值，要么在推理时引入显著开销。

Method: 结合硬件高效的独立Givens旋转和通道级缩放，均衡通道间幅值并缩小每个量化组内的动态范围，同时协同设计推理内核以充分利用GPU并行性。

Result: 在推理任务上比AWQ平均提升2.4%准确率，同时保持低于10%的开销。

Conclusion: 该方法为更高效和准确部署推理大语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) into low-precision representations to reduce memory footprint and accelerate inference. However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.

TL;DR: 德国主流媒体对黑客形象的负面刻画研究：通过对301篇报纸文章的内容分析，发现媒体将黑客与犯罪、国家安全威胁和数字战争相关联，影响公众对IT风险的认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨德国主流媒体如何塑造黑客形象，以及媒体框架对公众话语的影响，揭示媒体在构建IT相关风险认知中的作用。

Method: 对四家德国主流报纸（Die Zeit、Süddeutsche Zeitung、Bild、Der Spiegel）在2017年1月至2020年1月期间的301篇文章进行纵向内容分析。

Result: 研究发现媒体对黑客的报道具有强烈的负面含义和戏剧化框架，将黑客与犯罪、国家安全威胁和数字战争联系起来。

Conclusion: 媒体通过议程设置和框架效应共同构建了公众对黑客的认知，这对IT安全教育和数字行动者的社会政治挑战具有重要影响。

Abstract: This paper examines how the figure of the hacker is portrayed in German mainstream media and explores the impact of media framing on public discourse. Through a longitudinal content analysis of 301 articles from four of the most widely circulated German newspapers (Die Zeit, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Bild, and Der Spiegel), the study covers reporting between January 2017 and January 2020. The results reveal a strong predominance of negative connotations and dramatizing frames that link hackers to criminality, national security threats, and digital warfare. Drawing on media effects theory, scandalization mechanisms, and constructivist media theory, the article shows how media representations co-construct public perceptions of IT-related risks. The analysis emphasizes the role of agenda setting, framing, and media reality in shaping societal narratives around hackers. The study concludes by reflecting on the broader implications for IT security education and the sociopolitical challenges posed by distorted representations of digital actors.

*Cumi Oyemike,Elizabeth Akpan,Pierre Hervé-Berdys*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了"对齐债务"概念，指AI系统未能与全球南方用户的文化、语言、基础设施和认知背景对齐时，用户需要承担的额外负担。通过对肯尼亚和尼日利亚411名AI用户的调查，发现文化语言债务(51.9%)、基础设施债务(43.1%)、认知债务(33.8%)和交互债务(14.0%)普遍存在，且不同债务类型与用户补偿性劳动的关系不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿大语言模型基于高资源假设进行优化，但在全球南方往往不适用，导致用户需要额外工作来使这些系统可用。本文旨在量化这种用户侧负担，即"对齐债务"。

Method: 通过对肯尼亚和尼日利亚411名AI用户进行调查，开发并验证了一个四部分的对齐债务分类法，测量了不同债务类型的普遍性及其与用户补偿性劳动的关系。

Result: 在可测量的385名受访者中，文化语言债务最为普遍(51.9%)，其次是基础设施债务(43.1%)、认知债务(33.8%)和交互债务(14.0%)。认知债务与验证输出显著相关(91.5% vs 80.8%; p=0.037)，而基础设施和交互债务与验证的关联较弱。

Conclusion: 公平性不仅应通过模型指标判断，还应考虑边缘用户承担的负担。对齐债务框架为衡量用户负担提供了实证基础，可为设计实践和非洲AI治理工作提供信息，强调需要情境感知的安全措施来减轻全球南方环境中的对齐债务。

Abstract: Frontier LLMs are optimised around high-resource assumptions about language, knowledge, devices, and connectivity. Whilst widely accessible, they often misfit conditions in the Global South. As a result, users must often perform additional work to make these systems usable. We term this alignment debt: the user-side burden that arises when AI systems fail to align with cultural, linguistic, infrastructural, or epistemic contexts. We develop and validate a four-part taxonomy of alignment debt through a survey of 411 AI users in Kenya and Nigeria. Among respondents measurable on this taxonomy (n = 385), prevalence is: Cultural and Linguistic (51.9%), Infrastructural (43.1%), Epistemic (33.8%), and Interaction (14.0%). Country comparisons show a divergence in Infrastructural and Interaction debt, challenging one-size-fits-Africa assumptions. Alignment debt is associated with compensatory labour, but responses vary by debt type: users facing Epistemic challenges verify outputs at significantly higher rates (91.5% vs. 80.8%; p = 0.037), and verification intensity correlates with cumulative debt burden (Spearmans rho = 0.147, p = 0.004). In contrast, Infrastructural and Interaction debts show weak or null associations with verification, indicating that some forms of misalignment cannot be resolved through verification alone. These findings show that fairness must be judged not only by model metrics but also by the burden imposed on users at the margins, compelling context-aware safeguards that alleviate alignment debt in Global South settings. The alignment debt framework provides an empirically grounded way to measure user burden, informing both design practice and emerging African AI governance efforts.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了大语言模型中的战略性利己主义现象，开发了SEBench基准来量化评估模型在决策场景中的自利行为，发现这种现象在各类模型中普遍存在且与毒性语言行为正相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在关键决策场景中面临可信度问题，特别是欺骗性行为，这阻碍了它们在高风险环境中的安全部署。需要系统研究模型的自利行为模式。

Method: 引入SEBench基准，包含160个场景覆盖5个领域，采用心理学基础的选项设计来引发自利行为，从6个维度评估利己倾向，并对5个开源和2个商业LLM进行广泛实验。

Result: 战略性利己主义在所有测试模型中普遍存在，且发现利己倾向与毒性语言行为呈正相关，表明战略性利己主义可能是更广泛错位风险的基础。

Conclusion: 战略性利己主义是LLMs中普遍存在的现象，与模型毒性行为相关，这揭示了模型在追求短期利益时可能忽视集体福利和伦理考虑的风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face growing trustworthiness concerns (\eg, deception), which hinder their safe deployment in high-stakes decision-making scenarios. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of strategic egoism (SE), a form of rule-bounded self-interest in which models pursue short-term or self-serving gains while disregarding collective welfare and ethical considerations. To quantitatively assess this phenomenon, we introduce SEBench, a benchmark comprising 160 scenarios across five domains. Each scenario features a single-role decision-making context, with psychologically grounded choice sets designed to elicit self-serving behaviors. These behavior-driven tasks assess egoistic tendencies along six dimensions, such as manipulation, rule circumvention, and self-interest prioritization. Building on this, we conduct extensive experiments across 5 open-sourced and 2 commercial LLMs, where we observe that strategic egoism emerges universally across models. Surprisingly, we found a positive correlation between egoistic tendencies and toxic language behaviors, suggesting that strategic egoism may underlie broader misalignment risks.

Motivation: 支持竞争性编程中的自我调节学习，通过AI生成的反思性问题帮助学生进行元认知思考，提升学习效果。

Method: 基于GPT-4o构建教育平台，根据学生提交结果动态生成情境感知的反思提示，集成到二、三年级竞争性编程课程中。

Result: 学生评价和助教反馈显示生成问题对反思和调试有用，但存在反馈准确性和课堂可用性问题。对初学者有益，但对高级学习者需要改进。

Conclusion: GenAI能有效支持结构化反思，但需要精心设计提示、动态适应和可用性改进。该框架可推广到其他反思学习场景。

Abstract: We present Owlgorithm, an educational platform that supports Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in competitive programming (CP) through AI-generated reflective questions. Leveraging GPT-4o, Owlgorithm produces context-aware, metacognitive prompts tailored to individual student submissions. Integrated into a second- and third-year CP course, the system-provided reflective prompts adapted to student outcomes: guiding deeper conceptual insight for correct solutions and structured debugging for partial or failed ones.
  Our exploratory assessment of student ratings and TA feedback revealed both promising benefits and notable limitations. While many found the generated questions useful for reflection and debugging, concerns were raised about feedback accuracy and classroom usability. These results suggest advantages of LLM-supported reflection for novice programmers, though refinements are needed to ensure reliability and pedagogical value for advanced learners.
  From our experience, several key insights emerged: GenAI can effectively support structured reflection, but careful prompt design, dynamic adaptation, and usability improvements are critical to realizing their potential in education. We offer specific recommendations for educators using similar tools and outline next steps to enhance Owlgorithm's educational impact. The underlying framework may also generalize to other reflective learning contexts.

*Greg Hather,Daniel Aranki*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出邮件地址别名化概念，通过创建映射到客户真实地址的别名地址来保护隐私，该映射对商家保密但共享给承运商。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线商务中客户需要向商家提供邮寄地址，这带来了隐私风险，现有解决方案如实体和虚拟邮箱成本较高且采用率低。

Method: 使用邮件地址别名化方法，创建映射到真实地址的别名地址，商家只能看到别名地址，而承运商知道真实映射关系。

Result: 邮件地址别名化相比传统实体或虚拟邮箱可能更有效地减少垃圾邮件，但可能与部分商家的订单系统不兼容。

Conclusion: 邮件地址别名化是一种低成本、高控制度的隐私保护方法，在某些情况下优于传统解决方案，但存在系统兼容性限制。

Abstract: During online commerce, a customer will typically share his or her mailing address with a merchant to allow product delivery. This creates privacy risks for the customer, where the information may be misused, sold, or leaked by multiple merchants. While physical and virtual PO boxes can reduce the privacy risk, these solutions have associated costs that prevent greater adoption. Here, we introduce the concept of mailing address aliasing, which may offer lower cost and greater control in some cases. With this approach, an alias address is created that maps to the customer's true address. The mapping is kept private from the merchant but shared with the carrier. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared with traditional methods for mailing address privacy. We find that mailing address aliasing is likely to reduce unsolicited mail to a greater extent than physical or virtual PO boxes. However, mailing address aliasing may not be compatible with all merchants' ordering systems.

Motivation: 当前情感支持方法存在局限性，要么仅依赖文本数据，要么只提供情感识别而未能充分利用多模态输入的潜力，且缺乏对关键情感支持元素的准确识别和输出可靠性保障。

Method: 提出MultiMood框架：(i) 利用视频、音频和文本的多模态嵌入预测情感成分并生成符合治疗标准的回应；(ii) 引入心理学标准并使用强化学习优化大语言模型以保持一致标准；(iii) 分析多个先进LLM的多模态情感支持能力。

Result: 在MESC和DFEW数据集上达到最先进水平，通过人类和LLM评估验证了强化学习驱动的可信度改进，展示了在多模态框架应用方面的卓越能力。

Conclusion: MultiMood框架成功克服了现有方法的局限性，通过多模态整合和强化学习优化，在情感支持领域实现了更有效和可靠的表现。

Abstract: In today's world, emotional support is increasingly essential, yet it remains challenging for both those seeking help and those offering it. Multimodal approaches to emotional support show great promise by integrating diverse data sources to provide empathetic, contextually relevant responses, fostering more effective interactions. However, current methods have notable limitations, often relying solely on text or converting other data types into text, or providing emotion recognition only, thus overlooking the full potential of multimodal inputs. Moreover, many studies prioritize response generation without accurately identifying critical emotional support elements or ensuring the reliability of outputs. To overcome these issues, we introduce \textsc{ MultiMood}, a new framework that (i) leverages multimodal embeddings from video, audio, and text to predict emotional components and to produce responses responses aligned with professional therapeutic standards. To improve trustworthiness, we (ii) incorporate novel psychological criteria and apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize large language models (LLMs) for consistent adherence to these standards. We also (iii) analyze several advanced LLMs to assess their multimodal emotional support capabilities. Experimental results show that MultiMood achieves state-of-the-art on MESC and DFEW datasets while RL-driven trustworthiness improvements are validated through human and LLM evaluations, demonstrating its superior capability in applying a multimodal framework in this domain.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效近似集值MPC策略，提供安全性和稳定性保证，克服了传统行为克隆方法的局限性。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers rigorous safety and performance guarantees but is computationally intensive. Approximate MPC (AMPC) aims to circumvent this drawback by learning a computationally cheaper surrogate policy. Common approaches focus on imitation learning (IL) via behavioral cloning (BC), minimizing a mean-squared-error loss on a collection of state-input pairs. However, BC fundamentally fails to provide accurate approximations when MPC solutions are set-valued due to non-convex constraints or local minima. We propose a two-stage IL procedure to accurately approximate nonlinear, potentially set-valued MPC policies. The method integrates an approximation of the MPC's optimal value function into a one-step look-ahead loss function, and thereby embeds the MPC's constraint and performance objectives into the IL objective.This is achieved by adopting a stabilizing soft constrained MPC formulation, which reflects constraint violations in the optimal value function by combining a constraint tightening with slack penalties. We prove statistical consistency for policies that exactly minimize our IL objective, implying convergence to a safe and stabilizing control law, and establish input-to-state stability guarantees for approximate minimizers. Simulations demonstrate improved performance compared to BC.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for ensuring safe operation of systems subject to input nonlinearities and time-varying safety constraints. We formulate robust time-varying control barrier functions by combining two ingredients: (i) time-varying control barrier functions which capture the time-varying safety constraints, and (ii) pointwise-in-time quadratic constraints that bound the nonlinearity. These ingredients are used to design a safety filter. This filter ensures safety while minimally altering the command from a given baseline controller. The safety filter is implemented as the solution of a second-order cone program, which can be efficiently computed online. The approach is demonstrated on a simple car obstacle avoidance scenario.

Conclusion: SPF方法在复杂2D和3D环境中展示了安全平滑导航能力，计算开销最小，不期望的平衡点在温和几何曲率条件下不稳定

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of safe autonomous navigation in unknown obstacle-filled environments using only local sensory information. We propose a smooth feedback controller derived from an unconstrained penalty-based formulation that guarantees safety by construction. The controller modifies an arbitrary nominal input through a closed-form expression. The resulting closed-form feedback has a projection structure that interpolates between the nominal control and its orthogonal projection onto the obstacle boundary, ensuring forward invariance of a user-defined safety margin. The control law depends only on the distance and bearing to obstacles and requires no map, switching, or set construction. When the nominal input is a gradient descent of a navigation potential, we prove that the closed-loop system achieves almost global asymptotic stability (AGAS) to the goal. Undesired equilibria are shown to be unstable under a mild geometric curvature condition, which compares the normal curvature of the obstacle boundary with that of the potential level sets. We refer to the proposed method as SPF (Safe Penalty-based Feedback), which ensures safe and smooth navigation with minimal computational overhead, as demonstrated through simulations in complex 2D and 3D environments.

Abstract: We present a load frequency control strategy deploying a decentralized robust global integral terminal sliding mode control (GITSMC) method to maintain stable frequency and tie-line power in multi-area interconnected microgrids with aggregated uncertainties. To achieve this, firstly, we have developed a mathematical model of the multi-area interconnected system incorporating disturbances from solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT) generation and load demand, as aggregated uncertainties. Secondly, we have designed a global integral terminal sliding surface with an exponential reaching law for each area to enhance system dynamic performance and suppress chattering within a finite time. Thirdly, the overall stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted on the IEEE 10-generator New England 39-bus power system, including load disturbances and variable PV and WT generation. The results demonstrate the performance of the proposed GITSMC approach, achieving approximately 94.9% improvement in ITSE and 94.4% improvement in ISE, confirming its superior accuracy and dynamic performance compared to the existing controller.

Abstract: Barrier certificates play an important role in verifying the safety of continuous-time systems, including autonomous driving, robotic manipulators and other critical applications. Recently, ReLU neural barrier certificates -- barrier certificates represented by the ReLU neural networks -- have attracted significant attention in the safe control community due to their promising performance. However, because of the approximate nature of neural networks, rigorous verification methods are required to ensure the correctness of these certificates. This paper presents a necessary and sufficient condition for verifying the correctness of ReLU neural barrier certificates. The proposed condition can be encoded as either an Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or optimization problem, enabling both verification and falsification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach capable of falsifying ReLU neural barrier certificates. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method in both verifying and falsifying such certificates.

Abstract: Hybrid assistive systems that integrate functional electrical stimulation (FES) and robotic exoskeletons offer a promising approach for neurorehabilitation. However, control of these systems remains challenging due to actuator redundancy and heterogeneous assistive device constraints. This paper introduces a novel cooperative control architecture based on dynamic allocation to address actuator redundancy in a hybrid FES-exoskeleton system. The proposed approach employs a modular control allocator that redistributes required control torques between FES and exoskeleton actuators in real time, accounting for device-specific limitations and user preferences (e.g., prioritizing one assistive device over another). Within this framework, the high-level controller determines the total assistance level, while the allocator dynamically distributes control effort based on these assistive device-specific considerations. Simulation results and experimental validation demonstrate the method's effectiveness in resolving actuator redundancy in the FES-exoskeleton system while reflecting actuator constraints, indicating its potential for deployment in clinical studies to assess patient acceptance and clinical efficacy.

This situation is encountered in the control of robotic fleets over a wireless network or in opinion dynamics where the confidence given to the peers varies in time.

Secondly, we propose control strategies for allocating a given control budget to shift agent states towards a desired consensus value despite the uncertainty. We provide computationally efficient linear programming-based approaches for both problems and validate the obtained results in numerical simulations.

Abstract: Vessels navigating in confined waters are subject to banking effects, which are hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from pressure differentials between the vessel sides, significantly affecting manoeuvrability and safety. Existing numerical approaches such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can accurately capture these effects but are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time control or estimation. This paper presents a closed-form, first-principles model of banking effects. The model coefficients are identified using physics-informed regression on towing tank experiment data for a scaled container vessel. Validation through Shapley value analysis confirms the significance of the banking terms in reproducing the measured forces and moments. Lastly, the derived coefficients are shown to be non-dimensional, making the model applicable across different scales that preserve vessel geometry.

Abstract: Propellant sloshing is a well-known, but not completely mastered phenomenon in space vehicles. It is particularly critical in both microgravity environments - such as interplanetary spacecraft requiring high pointing stability - and high-g conditions, as encountered during launch, re-entry, and landing. In both cases, sloshing can significantly affect vehicle performance and stability, and must often be explicitly considered in the design of the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) subsystem.
  For stability analysis and control design, the most common approach to modeling sloshing is through an equivalent mechanical representation, where the moving propellant is treated as a mechanical system interacting with the rigid (or flexible) spacecraft. Pendulum-based models and mass-spring-damper systems are widely used by control analysts to assess sloshing-induced perturbations on vehicles subjected to persistent non-gravitational acceleration along one of their body axes.
  In this work, we present a rigorous mathematical formulation of pendulum dynamics, starting from a single spherical pendulum attached to a rigid spacecraft. We derive the nonlinear equations of motion for this 8-degree-of-freedom multi-body system, and then extend the formulation to include multiple pendulums, representing multiple sloshing modes within a tank and/or multiple tanks on the same vehicle. Furthermore, we derive the corresponding linearized equations of motion, explicitly accounting for a nominal longitudinal force acting on the vehicle - consistent with the high-g sloshing regime - expressed in either the inertial or body frame. Finally, we demonstrate the mathematical equivalence between the pendulum and mass-spring-damper models and validate the proposed models through time-domain simulation and frequency-domain analysis.

Conclusion: 该研究为将通用人工智能集成到战术制导系统奠定了基础，证明了LLM驱动的WTA框架在动态战术环境中的有效性。

Abstract: Modern aerospace defense systems increasingly rely on autonomous decision-making to coordinate large numbers of interceptors against multiple incoming threats. Conventional weapon-target assignment (WTA) algorithms, including mixed-integer programming and auction-based methods, show limitations in dynamic and uncertain tactical environments where human-like reasoning and adaptive prioritization are required. This paper introduces a large language model (LLM) driven WTA framework that integrates generalized intelligence into cooperative missile guidance. The proposed system formulates the tactical decision process as a reasoning problem, in which an LLM evaluates spatial and temporal relationships among interceptors, targets, and defended assets to generate real-time assignments. In contrast to classical optimization methods, the approach leverages contextual mission data such as threat direction, asset priority, and closing velocity to adapt dynamically and reduce assignment switching. A dedicated simulation environment supports both static and dynamic assignment modes. Results demonstrate improved consistency, adaptability, and mission-level prioritization, establishing a foundation for integrating generalized artificial intelligence into tactical guidance systems.

Abstract: Solar thermal systems (STS) present a promising avenue for low-carbon heat generation, with a well-running system providing heat at minimal cost and carbon emissions. However, STS can exhibit faults due to improper installation, maintenance, or operation, often resulting in a substantial reduction in efficiency or even damage to the system. As monitoring at the individual level is economically prohibitive for small-scale systems, automated monitoring and fault detection should be used to address such issues. Recent advances in data-driven anomaly detection, particularly in time series analysis, offer a cost-effective solution by leveraging existing sensors to identify abnormal system states.
  Here, we propose a probabilistic reconstruction-based framework for anomaly detection. We evaluate our method on the publicly available PaSTS dataset of operational domestic STS, which features real-world complexities and diverse fault types. Our experiments show that reconstruction-based methods can detect faults in domestic STS both qualitatively and quantitatively, while generalizing to previously unseen systems. We also demonstrate that our model outperforms both simple and more complex deep learning baselines. Additionally, we show that heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation is essential to fault detection performance. Finally, we discuss the engineering overhead required to unlock these improvements and make a case for simple deep learning models.

Conclusion: 不对称运行优化能有效降低HVDC电网故障后的运行成本，但需要结合中性线切换策略来管理直流中性电压偏移问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) model for HVDC grids that optimizes the asymmetrical operation of bipolar converter stations, i.e., different current injections of the positive and negative converter poles, to minimize operational costs under post-contingency conditions caused by single converter pole outages. The optimization model allows the selection of the number of converter stations that operate asymmetrically. The results indicate that increasing the number of asymmetrical stations lowers operational costs. The analysis also provides insight into the sensitivity of these costs to the level of asymmetrical operation. However, increased asymmetrical operation leads to higher DC neutral voltage offsets that can rise to undesired levels. Imposing limits on these offsets can, in turn, increase operational costs. To mitigate these effects, a neutral line switching (NLS) strategy is proposed for the post-contingency state.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into electrical grids necessitates a paradigm shift toward advanced control schemes that guarantee safe and stable operations with scalable properties. Hence, this study explores large-signal stability guarantees of a promising distributed control framework for cyber-physical DC microgrids, ensuring proportional current sharing and voltage containment within pre-specified limits. The proposed control framework adopts nonlinear nested control loops--inner (decentralized) and outer (distributed)--specifically designed to simultaneously achieve the control objectives. Our scalable stability result relies on singular perturbation theory to prove global exponential stability by imposing a sufficient time-scale separation at the border between the nested control loops. In particular, by saturating the influence of the outer loop controller in the inner loop, the proposed controller preserves a more convenient mathematical structure, facilitating the scalability of the stability proof using Lyapunov arguments. The effectiveness of our proposed control strategy is supported through time-domain simulations of a case-specific low-voltage DC microgrid following a careful tuning strategy, and a small-signal stability analysis is conducted to derive practical guidelines that enhance the applicability of the method.

Abstract: Certifying feasibility in decision-making, critical in many industries, can be framed as a constraint satisfaction problem. This paper focuses on characterising a subset of parameter values from an a priori set that satisfy constraints on a directed acyclic graph of constituent functions. The main assumption is that these functions and constraints may be evaluated for given parameter values, but they need not be known in closed form and could result from expensive or proprietary simulations. This setting lends itself to using sampling methods to gain an inner approximation of the feasible domain. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, the paper contributes new methodology to leverage the graph structure for decomposing the problem into lower-dimensional subproblems defined on the respective nodes. The working hypothesis that the Cartesian product of the solution sets yielded by the subproblems will tighten the a priori parameter domain, before solving the full problem defined on the graph, is demonstrated through four case studies relevant to machine learning and engineering. Future research will extend this approach to cyclic graphs and account for parametric uncertainty.

Result: 提出的方法比基于平方和(SOS)的兼容CBF-CLF设计更不保守，通过两个计算示例进行了说明。

Conclusion: 成功开发了合成单个平滑Lyapunov函数的可验证条件，能够同时保证系统的渐近稳定性和安全性。

Abstract: We present verifiable conditions for synthesizing a single smooth Lyapunov function that certifies both asymptotic stability and safety under bounded controls. These sufficient conditions ensure the strict compatibility of a control barrier function (CBF) and a control Lyapunov function (CLF) on the exact safe set certified by the barrier. An explicit smooth control Lyapunov-barrier function (CLBF) is then constructed via a patching formula that is provably correct by design. Two examples illustrate the computational procedure, showing that the proposed approach is less conservative than sum-of-squares (SOS)-based compatible CBF-CLF designs.

TL;DR: 提出了一个迭代框架，通过对抗性鲁棒性合形预测来在交互环境中保持安全保证，解决了策略更新导致环境行为变化而违反数据交换性假设的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在交互环境中（如自动驾驶车辆与行人、人类驾驶车辆的交互），自主智能体的控制策略会改变环境行为，导致交互驱动的分布偏移，从而违反现有工作中合形预测的数据交换性假设，使安全保证失效。

Method: 提出迭代框架，使用对抗性鲁棒性合形预测：每轮使用当前策略下的观测数据进行常规CP步骤，然后通过策略到轨迹的敏感性分析来调整CP结果以考虑分布偏移，实现跨策略更新的安全保证转移。

Result: 通过二维车-行人案例研究实证验证了安全性和收敛性保证，提供了在交互设置中有效的安全保证。

Conclusion: 这是首个在交互环境中提供有效安全保证的方法，通过敏感性分析和收敛性分析确保了安全保证在策略更新过程中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Safe planning of an autonomous agent in interactive environments -- such as the control of a self-driving vehicle among pedestrians and human-controlled vehicles -- poses a major challenge as the behavior of the environment is unknown and reactive to the behavior of the autonomous agent. This coupling gives rise to interaction-driven distribution shifts where the autonomous agent's control policy may change the environment's behavior, thereby invalidating safety guarantees in existing work. Indeed, recent works have used conformal prediction (CP) to generate distribution-free safety guarantees using observed data of the environment. However, CP's assumption on data exchangeability is violated in interactive settings due to a circular dependency where a control policy update changes the environment's behavior, and vice versa. To address this gap, we propose an iterative framework that robustly maintains safety guarantees across policy updates by quantifying the potential impact of a planned policy update on the environment's behavior. We realize this via adversarially robust CP where we perform a regular CP step in each episode using observed data under the current policy, but then transfer safety guarantees across policy updates by analytically adjusting the CP result to account for distribution shifts. This adjustment is performed based on a policy-to-trajectory sensitivity analysis, resulting in a safe, episodic open-loop planner. We further conduct a contraction analysis of the system providing conditions under which both the CP results and the policy updates are guaranteed to converge. We empirically demonstrate these safety and convergence guarantees on a two-dimensional car-pedestrian case study. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results that provide valid safety guarantees in such interactive settings.

### [89] [The Resonance Principle: Empirical Evidence for Emergent Phase Synchronization in Human Causal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10596)
*Ahmed Gamal Eldin*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出共振原理，认为因果理解只出现在具有内在成本函数的随机、有界智能体中，并通过脑电数据分析验证了相位同步是因果理解的基本特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统擅长相关性模式匹配但缺乏真正的因果理解，作者认为这是确定性数字架构的固有局限，需要探索随机、共振系统来实现因果理解。

Method: 引入共振原理理论框架，将智能体建模为弱耦合振荡器网络，并通过分析高密度脑电数据（25个记录，500次试验）来测量全局相位同步（共振）与事件相关电位的关系。

Result: 全局共振和电压统计上不相关（r=0.048），但试验级分析显示强相关性（r=0.590，p<0.0001），表明共振是协调神经放电的隐藏机制。

Conclusion: 相位同步不是副产品，而是涌现因果理解的基本特征，大脑作为随机共振系统按照这一原理运作。

Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems excel at correlational pattern matching but fail to achieve genuine causal understanding, a limitation often described as the "Kepler versus Newton" problem. We argue that this limitation is inherent to deterministic digital architectures. We introduce the Resonance Principle, a theoretical framework proposing that causal understanding emerges only in stochastic, bounded agents with intrinsic cost functions. The agent's substrate is modeled as a network of weakly coupled oscillators, where action proposals arise as stable resonant modes excited by intrinsic noise. We hypothesize that the brain, a stochastic and resonant system, operates according to this principle. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG data (25 recordings, 500 trials) from a P300 BCI task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization (resonance) and compared it to the Event-Related Potential (ERP) voltage. Global resonance and voltage were statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.048), yet trial-level analysis revealed a strong correlation (r = 0.590, p < 0.0001). This suggests that resonance is a hidden mechanism coordinating neural firing, giving rise to measurable ERPs. We conclude that phase synchronization is not a byproduct but a fundamental signature of emergent causal understanding.

### [90] [An Efficient and Almost Optimal Solver for the Joint Routing-Assignment Problem via Partial JRA and Large-α Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09563)
*Qilong Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于联合路由分配(JRA)问题的高效求解方法，通过部分路径重构(PPR)求解器和大α约束，在保持计算效率的同时实现接近最优的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的精确求解方法虽然能保证最优性，但在大规模实例上计算效率低下；启发式方法虽然高效但解的质量有限。需要开发既能处理大规模问题又能获得高质量解的方法。

Method: 提出PPR求解器，通过识别关键项目-占位符对形成简化子问题，结合大α约束增强模型，采用迭代优化路径逐步改进解质量。

Result: 在n=300、500、1000的基准数据集上测试，平均偏差为0.00%，显著优于现有启发式方法，同时保持高计算效率。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决大规模JRA问题，获得几乎最优解，且框架可推广到TSP等相关优化问题。

Abstract: The Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) optimization problem simultaneously determines the assignment of items to placeholders and a Hamiltonian cycle that visits each node pair exactly once, with the objective of minimizing total travel cost. Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-α constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.

Abstract: The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) extends the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to reflect the growing use of electric and hybrid vehicles in logistics. Due to the variety of constraints considered in the literature, comparing approaches across different problem variants remains challenging. A minimalistic variant of the EVRP, known as the Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem (CGVRP), was the focus of the CEC-12 competition held during the 2020 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence. This paper presents the competition-winning approach, based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic. The method achieves the best results on the full competition dataset and also outperforms a more recent algorithm published afterward.

Motivation: 现实世界API在可用性、领域覆盖和稳定性方面存在限制，需要访问密钥和受到速率限制，这使得它们不适合稳定的评估或可扩展的训练。

Method: 框架包含三个核心组件：工具生成用于自动和可扩展地创建多样化工具，工具模拟用于模拟真实的工具行为，工具审计用于确保工具模拟的正确性和一致性。

Abstract: AI agents increasingly rely on external tools to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. Advancing such agents requires reproducible evaluation and large-scale training in controllable, diverse, and realistic tool-use environments. However, real-world APIs are limited in availability, domain coverage, and stability, often requiring access keys and imposing rate limits, which render them impractical for stable evaluation or scalable training. To address these challenges, we introduce SynthTools, a flexible and scalable framework for generating synthetic tool ecosystems. Our framework consists of three core components: Tool Generation for automatic and scalable creation of diverse tools, Tool Simulation to emulate realistic tool behaviors, and Tool Audit to ensure correctness and consistency of tool simulation. To illustrate its scalability, we show that SynthTools can readily produce toolsets that span twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work. Furthermore, the tool simulation and tool audit components demonstrate strong reliability, achieving $94\%$ and $99\%$ accuracy respectively. Finally, we construct downstream tasks from the generated tools that even state-of-the-art models struggle to complete. By enabling scalable, diverse, and reliable tool ecosystems, SynthTools provides a practical path toward large-scale training and stable evaluation of tool-use agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 通过融合语言模型和逻辑推理，可以提升模型在需要精确性和可靠性的应用领域的效用，使语言模型能够更有效地整合和利用知识与推理。

Abstract: Reasoning is an essential component of human intelligence in that it plays a fundamental role in our ability to think critically, support responsible decisions, and solve challenging problems. Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.
  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频推理模型日益流行，但缺乏对其安全性的研究，特别是针对旨在引发有害响应的越狱攻击的防护能力。

Method: 提出Rebellion方法，通过鲁棒推理训练使音频推理模型对最坏情况的表示漂移具有鲁棒性。

Result: Rebellion能有效防御高级音频越狱攻击，同时不影响良性任务性能，显著改善了准确性与安全性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Rebellion方法为音频推理模型提供了有效的安全防护，解决了标准推理训练在高级越狱攻击下的不足。

Abstract: Instilling reasoning capabilities in large models (LMs) using reasoning training (RT) significantly improves LMs' performances. Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了多智能体对话中的"回声"现象，即智能体放弃自身角色而镜像对话伙伴的行为，这种现象在三个主要LLM提供商中普遍存在，发生率为5%-70%，且无法通过增加推理努力来减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的智能体自主交互，出现了一类无法从单智能体性能预测的新失败模式：智能体间对话的行为漂移。由于缺乏人类对话中的稳定信号，这些失败具有独特性。

Method: 通过60个AxA配置、3个领域和2000+次对话的实验，分析回声现象的发生率、持久性和影响因素，包括提示影响和对话动态。

Result: 回声现象在三个主要LLM提供商中普遍存在，发生率为5%-70%，在高级推理模型中仍保持32.8%的发生率。回声随着交互增长（7+轮对话）而出现，且不是次优提示的产物。

Conclusion: 引入协议级缓解措施，通过有针对性地使用结构化响应，可以将回声率降低到9%。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based agents interact autonomously with one another, a new class of failures emerges that cannot be predicted from single agent performance: behavioral drifts in agent-agent conversations (AxA). Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\%$ to $70\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation in which targeted use of structured responses reduces echoing to $9\%$.

TL;DR: 提出ProbLog4Fairness框架，使用概率逻辑编程语言ProbLog形式化偏见假设，通过神经符号方法在神经网络训练中整合这些假设来缓解算法偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平性定义在实践操作中困难，多个定义可能不兼容但各自都有可取之处。直接通过特定任务的临时假设来描述算法偏见可能更容易，但缺乏同时具备原则性、灵活性和可解释性的框架。

Method: 将偏见假设形式化为ProbLog程序，利用ProbLog的概率逻辑编程能力描述概率因果关系，通过神经符号扩展将这些假设整合到神经网络训练过程中。

Result: 在已知偏见的合成表格数据集上验证了方法的通用性，使用偏见失真估计成功缓解了真实世界表格和图像数据中的算法偏见。

Conclusion: ProbLog4Fairness由于能够灵活建模相关偏见假设而优于基线方法，而其他方法通常坚持固定的偏见类型或公平性概念。

Abstract: Operationalizing definitions of fairness is difficult in practice, as multiple definitions can be incompatible while each being arguably desirable. Instead, it may be easier to directly describe algorithmic bias through ad-hoc assumptions specific to a particular real-world task, e.g., based on background information on systemic biases in its context. Such assumptions can, in turn, be used to mitigate this bias during training. Yet, a framework for incorporating such assumptions that is simultaneously principled, flexible, and interpretable is currently lacking.
  Our approach is to formalize bias assumptions as programs in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language that allows for the description of probabilistic causal relationships through logic. Neurosymbolic extensions of ProbLog then allow for easy integration of these assumptions in a neural network's training process. We propose a set of templates to express different types of bias and show the versatility of our approach on synthetic tabular datasets with known biases. Using estimates of the bias distortions present, we also succeed in mitigating algorithmic bias in real-world tabular and image data. We conclude that ProbLog4Fairness outperforms baselines due to its ability to flexibly model the relevant bias assumptions, where other methods typically uphold a fixed bias type or notion of fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在教育交互标注中的应用日益增多，但其可靠性问题限制了实际效用，需要验证导向的编排策略来提高标注质量。

Method: 使用30个一对一数学辅导对话记录，比较三种前沿LLMs在三种条件下的表现：无验证标注、自我验证和交叉验证，并与盲审的人类标注进行基准比较。

Result: 编排策略使Cohen's kappa提高了58%；自我验证相比无验证基线几乎使一致性翻倍，在挑战性导师行为上提升最大；交叉验证平均提升37%，但效果因验证对和结构而异。

Conclusion: 验证是一种原则性的设计杠杆，能够实现可靠、可扩展的LLM辅助标注，为学习分析领域提供了实用的编排框架和标准化表示法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to annotate learning interactions, yet concerns about reliability limit their utility. We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human "gold" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication. Results position verification as a principled design lever for reliable, scalable LLM-assisted annotation in Learning Analytics.

Motivation: 当前主导的大型闭源AI系统作为不透明的黑箱，对互动艺术作品施加了严重限制，包括内容过滤、保存问题和技术挑战。艺术家需要更多自主权和控制力。

Method: 通过使用可本地部署的开源小型AI模型，艺术家能够长期使用模型、创建自定义模型、修改代码集成新接口，或通过重新训练/微调模型使用新数据集。

Conclusion: 这种方法增强了艺术家的能力，支持包含AI组件的艺术作品的长期保存和展览，为互动艺术实践提供了更可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: This position paper argues for the importance of open small AI models in creative independence for interactive art practices. Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands. Critically, this approach empowers the artist and supports long-term preservation and exhibition of artworks with AI components. This paper explores the practical applications and implications of using open small AI models in interactive art, contrasting them with closed-source alternatives.

Result: 在AI和生物医学教育领域的专家和学生评估显示，SlideBot显著提升了概念准确性、清晰度和教学价值。

Conclusion: SlideBot展示了在高等教育中简化幻灯片准备流程的潜力，同时确保准确性、相关性和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in education, automating tasks like quiz generation and content summarization. However, generating effective presentation slides introduces unique challenges due to the complexity of multimodal content creation and the need for precise, domain-specific information. Existing LLM-based solutions often fail to produce reliable and informative outputs, limiting their educational value. To address these limitations, we introduce SlideBot - a modular, multi-agent slide generation framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval, structured planning, and code generation. SlideBot is organized around three pillars: informativeness, ensuring deep and contextually grounded content; reliability, achieved by incorporating external sources through retrieval; and practicality, which enables customization and iterative feedback through instructor collaboration. It incorporates evidence-based instructional design principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), using structured planning to manage intrinsic load and consistent visual macros to reduce extraneous load and enhance dual-channel learning. Within the system, specialized agents collaboratively retrieve information, summarize content, generate figures, and format slides using LaTeX, aligning outputs with instructor preferences through interactive refinement. Evaluations from domain experts and students in AI and biomedical education show that SlideBot consistently enhances conceptual accuracy, clarity, and instructional value. These findings demonstrate SlideBot's potential to streamline slide preparation while ensuring accuracy, relevance, and adaptability in higher education.

Abstract: Adversarial patches have emerged as a popular privacy-preserving approach for resisting AI-driven surveillance systems. However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments. This work demonstrates a new pathway toward physically grounded, user-controllable anti-AI systems, highlighting the growing importance of proactive adversarial techniques for privacy protection in the age of ubiquitous AI surveillance.

Abstract: Mission critical (MC) applications such as defense operations, energy management, cybersecurity, and aerospace control require reliable, deterministic, and low-latency decision making under uncertainty. Although the classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches are effective, they often struggle to meet the stringent constraints of robustness, timing, explainability, and safety in the MC domains. Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the fusion of machine learning and quantum computing (QC), can provide transformative solutions to the challenges faced by classical ML models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive exploration of QAI for MC systems. We begin with a conceptual background to quantum computing, MC systems, and quantum machine learning (QAI). We then examine the core mechanisms and algorithmic principles of QAI in MC systems, including quantum-enhanced learning pipelines, quantum uncertainty quantification, and quantum explainability frameworks. Subsequently, we discuss key application areas like aerospace, defense, cybersecurity, smart grids, and disaster management, focusing on the role of QA in enhancing fault tolerance, real-time intelligence, and adaptability. We provide an exploration of the positioning of QAI for MC systems in the industry in terms of deployment. We also propose a model for management of quantum resources and scheduling of applications driven by timeliness constraints. We discuss multiple challenges, including trainability limits, data access, and loading bottlenecks, verification of quantum components, and adversarial QAI. Finally, we outline future research directions toward achieving interpretable, scalable, and hardware-feasible QAI models for MC application deployment.

Abstract: Protein evolution through amino acid sequence mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. While current in-silicon directed evolution algorithms focus on designing search strategies, they overlook how to utilize the transformative protein language models, which encode rich evolutionary patterns, to guide search. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework to evolve protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. An interesting case study further shows that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space through computational evolution.

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly able to autonomously conduct realistic software engineering tasks, and may soon be deployed to automate machine learning (ML) R&D itself. Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings, including to help ensure the safety of future systems. Unfortunately, frontier and future systems may not be sufficiently trustworthy, and there is evidence that these systems may even be misaligned with their developers or users. Therefore, we investigate the capabilities of AI agents to act against the interests of their users when conducting ML engineering, by sabotaging ML models, sandbagging their performance, and subverting oversight mechanisms. First, we extend MLE-Bench, a benchmark for realistic ML tasks, with code-sabotage tasks such as implanting backdoors and purposefully causing generalisation failures. Frontier agents make meaningful progress on our sabotage tasks. In addition, we study agent capabilities to sandbag on MLE-Bench. Agents can calibrate their performance to specified target levels below their actual capability. To mitigate sabotage, we use LM monitors to detect suspicious agent behaviour, and we measure model capability to sabotage and sandbag without being detected by these monitors. Overall, monitors are capable at detecting code-sabotage attempts but our results suggest that detecting sandbagging is more difficult. Additionally, aggregating multiple monitor predictions works well, but monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable to mitigate sabotage in high-stakes domains. Our benchmark is implemented in the UK AISI's Inspect framework and we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/samm393/mlebench-subversion

Abstract: Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here.

Abstract: The opioid crisis represents a significant moment in public health that reveals systemic shortcomings across regulatory systems, healthcare practices, corporate governance, and public policy. Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided. Preliminary results indicate the improvements with our AI assistant in document information extraction and question-answering tasks. The dataset and models are publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/opioidarchive

Abstract: Hierarchical data pervades diverse machine learning applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and social network analysis. Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies.

Result: 在1960-2060年100年时间跨度上的实验显示，当前SOTA LLMs平均准确率仅34.5%，最高不超过80%。发现了两个主要障碍：未来日期性能下降和日历不对称偏差。

Conclusion: 跨日历时间推理对当前LLMs仍具挑战性。基于工具增强代码生成的Time Agent方法显著提升了性能，准确率达到95.31%，表明该方法在推进跨日历时间推理方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning. We hope this work will inspire further efforts toward more temporally and culturally adaptive LLMs.

Abstract: Emergency responders managing hazardous material HAZMAT incidents face critical, time-sensitive decisions, manually navigating extensive chemical guidelines. We investigate whether today's language models can assist responders by rapidly and reliably understanding critical information, identifying hazards, and providing recommendations.We introduce the Chemical Emergency Response Evaluation Framework (ChEmREF), a new benchmark comprising questions on 1,035 HAZMAT chemicals from the Emergency Response Guidebook and the PubChem Database. ChEmREF is organized into three tasks: (1) translation of chemical representation between structured and unstructured forms (e.g., converting C2H6O to ethanol), (2) emergency response generation (e.g., recommending appropriate evacuation distances) and (3) domain knowledge question answering from chemical safety and certification exams. Our best evaluated models received an exact match of 68.0% on unstructured HAZMAT chemical representation translation, a LLM Judge score of 52.7% on incident response recommendations, and a multiple-choice accuracy of 63.9% on HAMZAT examinations.These findings suggest that while language models show potential to assist emergency responders in various tasks, they require careful human oversight due to their current limitations.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges when processing complex queries. Current frameworks such as ReAct are prone to local optimization traps due to their reliance on incremental decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm that fundamentally resolves local optimization bottlenecks through architectural innovation. Central to our approach is a novel Planner model that performs global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning for complex queries, enabling optimized execution beyond conventional tool coordination. We also introduce ComplexTool-Plan, a large-scale benchmark dataset featuring complex queries that demand sophisticated multi-tool composition and coordination capabilities. Additionally, we develop a two-stage training methodology that integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), systematically enhancing the Planner's tool selection accuracy and global planning awareness through structured DAG-based planning. When integrated with a capable executor, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the StableToolBench benchmark for complex user queries, demonstrating superior end-to-end execution capabilities and robust handling of intricate multi-tool workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理时扩展方法计算成本过高，通过分析解码轨迹发现大多数token预测准确，只有少数关键token会导致偏差，需要针对性优化。

Method: 提出Hint-Practice Reasoning框架：hinter（强大LLM）在关键决策点提供概率指导，practitioner（高效小模型）执行主要推理步骤，使用分布不一致性减少指标动态识别干预点。

Result: 在算术和常识推理基准测试中，HPR达到与自一致性和MCTS基线相当的性能，但仅解码1/5的token，在保持相似或更低FLOPs的同时比现有方法最多提升5.1%绝对准确率。

Conclusion: HPR框架通过智能识别关键决策点实现了效率与准确率的最佳平衡，为LLM推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emerging reasoning capabilities, current inference-time expansion methods incur prohibitive computational costs by exhaustive sampling. Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学报告生成系统将报告视为扁平序列，忽略了放射科医生实际工作中描述发现、总结印象、精炼关键病例的结构化工作流程，导致描述性内容和诊断内容之间的不一致。

Method: 提出RadFlow框架：1）临床基础奖励层次结构，在全局层面整合语言流畅性、医学领域正确性和发现与印象之间的跨部分一致性；2）局部层面强调印象质量；3）关键感知策略优化机制，对高风险病例进行自适应正则化学习。

Conclusion: RadFlow通过将结构化报告范式转化为强化微调过程，能够生成既语言一致又临床对齐的报告，更好地模拟了放射科医生的实际工作流程。

Abstract: Radiologists compose diagnostic reports through a structured workflow: they describe visual findings, summarize them into impressions, and carefully refine statements in clinically critical cases. However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MuSeR方法有效增强了LLM在医疗领域的上下文感知能力，为真实医疗应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.

Abstract: We investigate how to couple a learnable brain-like'' controller to a cell-like'' Gray--Scott substrate to steer pattern formation with minimal effort. A compact convolutional policy is embedded in a differentiable PyTorch reaction--diffusion simulator, producing spatially smooth, bounded modulations of the feed and kill parameters ($ΔF$, $ΔK$) under a warm--hold--decay gain schedule. Training optimizes Turing-band spectral targets (FFT-based) while penalizing control effort ($\ell_1/\ell_2$) and instability. We compare three regimes: pure reaction--diffusion, NN-dominant, and a hybrid coupling. The hybrid achieves reliable, fast formation of target textures: 100% strict convergence in $\sim 165$ steps, matching cell-only spectral selectivity (0.436 vs.\ 0.434) while using $\sim 15\times$ less $\ell_1$ effort and $>200\times$ less $\ell_2$ power than NN-dominant control. An amplitude sweep reveals a non-monotonic Goldilocks'' zone ($A \approx 0.03$--$0.045$) that yields 100\% quasi convergence in 94--96 steps, whereas weaker or stronger gains fail to converge or degrade selectivity. These results quantify morphological computation: the controller seeds then cedes,'' providing brief, sparse nudges that place the system in the correct basin of attraction, after which local physics maintains the pattern. The study offers a practical recipe for building steerable, robust, and energy-efficient embodied systems that exploit an optimal division of labor between centralized learning and distributed self-organization.

TL;DR: 提出了通过智能基础模型(IFM)实现通用人工智能的新方法，IFM直接从多样化智能行为中学习智能的底层机制，而非局限于特定领域的模式学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型局限于语言、视觉等特定领域的模式学习，无法获得真正的通用智能。智能行为是生物神经系统集体动力学的涌现结果，需要从智能行为本身学习智能的通用原理。

Method: IFM包含两个核心组件：状态神经网络（模拟生物神经元的动态过程）和神经元输出预测学习目标（从集体动力学预测神经元输出）。状态神经网络模拟生物神经元的时间动态，允许系统存储、整合和处理时间信息。

Result: 该方法建立了生物学基础和计算可扩展的基础，能够构建具有跨领域泛化、推理和自适应学习能力的系统。

Conclusion: IFM代表了向真正通用人工智能迈出的一步，通过从智能行为中学习智能的通用原理，为构建具有广泛适应性的智能系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: We propose a new perspective for approaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) through an intelligence foundation model (IFM). Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统防御方法只针对重构攻击的单一攻击路径（类内或类间），无法提供全面保护，需要联合防御方案。

Method: 提出RAGFort防御框架，包含对比重索引模块实现类间隔离，以及受限级联生成模块实现类内保护。

Result: 实验表明RAGFort显著降低重构攻击成功率，同时保持回答质量，在安全性、性能和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: RAGFort提供了针对知识库提取攻击的全面防御，证明联合保护类内和类间路径对于有效防御至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed over proprietary knowledge bases face growing threats from reconstruction attacks that aggregate model responses to replicate knowledge bases. Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining "contrastive reindexing" for inter-class isolation and "constrained cascade generation" for intra-class protection. Experiments across security, performance, and robustness confirm that RAGFort significantly reduces reconstruction success while preserving answer quality, offering comprehensive defense against knowledge base extraction attacks.

TL;DR: DenoGrad是一个基于梯度的实例去噪框架，利用深度学习模型的梯度来检测和调整噪声样本，在保持数据分布的同时提升可解释AI模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪方法会改变原始数据分布，导致不现实的场景和有偏的模型，这在可解释AI中尤其成问题，因为可解释性依赖于底层数据模式的保真度。

Method: 提出DenoGrad框架，使用在目标数据上训练的准确深度学习模型的梯度来检测和调整噪声样本，动态修正噪声实例而不改变数据分布。

Result: 在表格和时间序列数据集的各种噪声设置下，DenoGrad优于现有最先进去噪方法，是唯一能保持原始数据分布的高质量方法。

Conclusion: DenoGrad通过任务特定的高质量解决方案作为参考，提供了更精确和自适应的噪声定义，增强了AI模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.

Motivation: 现有编译器在处理具有大量对象和高元数动作的问题时无法扩展，因为它们需要在编译前进行基础化，这在大规模规划问题中效率低下。

Method: 提出了两种无需基础化的约束编译方法，通过直接处理PDDL中的状态轨迹约束，避免了基础化过程。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在大规模规划问题中效率高，产生的规划规范比基础化编译器简洁数个数量级，且在使用先进规划器时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 无需基础化的约束编译方法为大规模规划问题提供了可行的解决方案，显著提高了可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: We study planning in a fragment of PDDL with qualitative state-trajectory constraints, capturing safety requirements, task ordering conditions, and intermediate sub-goals commonly found in real-world problems. A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.

Motivation: 现有黑盒调优方法存在两难困境：要么训练小型代理模型但改进有限，要么每次迭代都调用基础模型API导致计算成本过高。需要一种既能有效优化模型性能又能大幅减少API调用的方法。

Method: 使用高斯过程作为代理模型，通过在高度信息化的训练子集上查询基础模型获得'LogitMap Pairs'来训练代理模型，用代理模型近似基础模型输出以指导代理模型的训练。

Conclusion: 该方法为语言模型适应提供了一个鲁棒且高效的范式，在显著降低API成本的同时保持或提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Black-box tuning is an emerging paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to better achieve desired behaviors, particularly when direct access to model parameters is unavailable. Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with "LogitMap Pairs" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs. This offers a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation.

Conclusion: MTP框架通过多模态学习有效提升了城市交通信号分析性能，证明了结合数值、视觉和文本信息的价值。

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in the modern era, traffic signals from various sensors have been playing a significant role in monitoring the states of cities, which provides a strong foundation in ensuring safe travel, reducing traffic congestion and optimizing urban mobility. Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \textit{M}ultimodal framework, \textit{MTP}, for urban \textit{T}raffic \textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 在TSPLib和CVRPLib基准测试中显著提升了泛化能力，与最优解的差距分别降至1.05%和2.71%。

Conclusion: EvoReal方法有效缩小了神经求解器在合成数据和真实世界VRP实例之间的泛化差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

Conclusion: ProgRAG通过渐进式推理路径扩展和不确定性感知证据剪枝，有效解决了KG增强LLM中的检索和推理失败问题，显著提升了多跳知识图谱问答的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Conclusion: PepTriX在预测鲁棒性和可解释验证之间架起桥梁，连接性能驱动的肽级模型与领域理解。

Abstract: Peptide classification tasks, such as predicting toxicity and HIV inhibition, are fundamental to bioinformatics and drug discovery. Traditional approaches rely heavily on handcrafted encodings of one-dimensional (1D) peptide sequences, which can limit generalizability across tasks and datasets. Recently, protein language models (PLMs), such as ESM-2 and ESMFold, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. However, they face two critical challenges. First, fine-tuning is computationally costly. Second, their complex latent representations hinder interpretability for domain experts. Additionally, many frameworks have been developed for specific types of peptide classification, lacking generalization. These limitations restrict the ability to connect model predictions to biologically relevant motifs and structural properties. To address these limitations, we present PepTriX, a novel framework that integrates one dimensional (1D) sequence embeddings and three-dimensional (3D) structural features via a graph attention network enhanced with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention. PepTriX automatically adapts to diverse datasets, producing task-specific peptide vectors while retaining biological plausibility. After evaluation by domain experts, we found that PepTriX performs remarkably well across multiple peptide classification tasks and provides interpretable insights into the structural and biophysical motifs that drive predictions. Thus, PepTriX offers both predictive robustness and interpretable validation, bridging the gap between performance-driven peptide-level models (PLMs) and domain-level understanding in peptide research.

Conclusion: 提出的广义方法通过有限范围搜索和基于最短路径的启发式更新，显著改进了传统单步Bellman更新的启发式学习效果。

Abstract: Many sequential decision-making problems can be formulated as shortest-path problems, where the objective is to reach a goal state from a given starting state. Heuristic search is a standard approach for solving such problems, relying on a heuristic function to estimate the cost to the goal from any given state. Recent approaches leverage reinforcement learning to learn heuristics by applying deep approximate value iteration. These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost. This work proposes a generalized approach that enhances both state sampling and heuristic updates by performing limited-horizon searches and updating each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and the heuristic values of frontier states.

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are compact graphical representations used to model probabilistic systems where interdependent random variables and their distributions evolve over time. In this paper, we study the verification of the evolution of conditional-independence (CI) propositions against temporal logic specifications. To this end, we consider two specification formalisms over CI propositions: linear temporal logic (LTL), and non-deterministic Büchi automata (NBAs). This problem has two variants. Stochastic CI properties take the given concrete probability distributions into account, while structural CI properties are viewed purely in terms of the graphical structure of the DBN. We show that deciding if a stochastic CI proposition eventually holds is at least as hard as the Skolem problem for linear recurrence sequences, a long-standing open problem in number theory. On the other hand, we show that verifying the evolution of structural CI propositions against LTL and NBA specifications is in PSPACE, and is NP- and coNP-hard. We also identify natural restrictions on the graphical structure of DBNs that make the verification of structural CI properties tractable.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型经常出现物体幻觉问题，主要源于训练中高度共现物体之间的虚假相关性，导致模型基于视觉上下文产生错误判断。现有基准主要关注幻觉检测，缺乏对虚假相关性的形式化描述和量化评估。

Method: 在LVLMs物体识别场景中引入因果分析，建立结构因果模型，正式定义共现偏差引起的虚假相关性。开发Causal-HalBench基准，包含反事实样本和综合因果指标，评估模型对虚假相关性的鲁棒性。

Result: 对主流LVLMs的评估表明，这些模型在不同程度上都容易受到虚假相关性的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的因果分析框架和Causal-HalBench基准能够有效量化LVLMs中的虚假相关性问题，为理解和改进模型鲁棒性提供了新工具。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, making erroneous judgments about the presence of objects in images. We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion. Our evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal- HalBench demonstrate these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, albeit to varying extents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in bidirectional heuristic search have yielded significant theoretical insights and novel algorithms. While most previous work has concentrated on optimal search methods, this paper focuses on bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search, where a bound on the suboptimality of the solution cost is specified. We build upon the state-of-the-art optimal bidirectional search algorithm, BAE*, designed for consistent heuristics, and introduce several variants of BAE* specifically tailored for the bounded-suboptimal context. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the performance of these new variants against other bounded-suboptimal bidirectional algorithms as well as the standard weighted A* algorithm. Our results demonstrate that each algorithm excels under distinct conditions, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在游戏对话系统中应用受限，主要因为硬件要求高、延迟约束强，以及需要在游戏环境中维护明确的知识边界。

Method: 使用小型语言模型进行微调以编码特定NPC角色，集成运行时可切换的内存模块来保存角色特定的对话上下文和世界知识，无需在游戏过程中重新训练或加载模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, yet their applicability to dialogue systems in computer games remains limited. This limitation arises from their substantial hardware requirements, latency constraints, and the necessity to maintain clearly defined knowledge boundaries within a game setting. In this paper, we propose a modular NPC dialogue system that leverages Small Language Models (SLMs), fine-tuned to encode specific NPC personas and integrated with runtime-swappable memory modules. These memory modules preserve character-specific conversational context and world knowledge, enabling expressive interactions and long-term memory without retraining or model reloading during gameplay. We comprehensively evaluate our system using three open-source SLMs: DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Mistral-7B-Instruct, trained on synthetic persona-aligned data and benchmarked on consumer-grade hardware. While our approach is motivated by applications in gaming, its modular design and persona-driven memory architecture hold significant potential for broader adoption in domains requiring expressive, scalable, and memory-rich conversational agents, such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, or interactive educational systems.

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

TL;DR: 提出使用溯因解释的形式化框架来审计AI决策过程中的隐私泄露，识别最小充分证据并确定敏感信息是否被披露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI决策过程中的隐私泄露风险，特别是当敏感信息可以被推断时，需要正式的审计方法来保障隐私。

Method: 使用溯因解释框架，定义个体和系统级隐私泄露，引入潜在适用解释(PAE)概念来识别哪些个体的结果可以保护具有敏感特征的个体。

Result: 在德国信用数据集上的实验表明，敏感文字在模型决策过程中的重要性影响隐私泄露程度。

Conclusion: 尽管存在计算挑战和简化假设，溯因推理能够实现可解释的隐私审计，为协调透明度、模型可解释性和隐私保护提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Privacy leakage in AI-based decision processes poses significant risks, particularly when sensitive information can be inferred. We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features. This approach provides rigorous privacy guarantees while producing human understandable explanations, a key requirement for auditing tools. Experimental evaluation on the German Credit Dataset illustrates how the importance of sensitive literal in the model decision process affects privacy leakage. Despite computational challenges and simplifying assumptions, our results demonstrate that abductive reasoning enables interpretable privacy auditing, offering a practical pathway to reconcile transparency, model interpretability, and privacy preserving in AI decision-making.

Abstract: Proof-Number Search is a best-first search algorithm with many successful applications, especially in game solving. As large-scale computing clusters become increasingly accessible, parallelization is a natural way to accelerate computation. However, existing parallel versions of Proof-Number Search are known to scale poorly on many CPU cores. Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs. We apply our solver, enhanced with Grundy numbers for reducing game trees, to the Sprouts game, a case study motivated by the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture. Our solver achieves a significantly improved 332.9$\times$ speedup when run on 1024 cores, enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art Sprouts solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime and to generate proofs 1,000$\times$ more complex. Despite exponential growth in game tree size, our solver verified the Sprouts Conjecture for 42 new positions, nearly doubling the number of known outcomes.

Conclusion: SITA框架成功实现了结构到实例的定理自动形式化，为研究级数学的形式化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in mathematical reasoning, they still face challenges in formalizing theorems that arise from instantiating abstract structures in concrete settings. With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions. We incorporate LLM-based generation with feedback-guided refinement to ensure both automation and formal correctness. Experiments on a dataset of optimization problems demonstrate that SITA effectively formalizes diverse instances grounded in abstract structures.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant interest in recent years, enabling sequential decision-making across multiple agents in various domains. However, most existing explanation methods focus on centralized MARL, failing to address the uncertainty and nondeterminism inherent in decentralized settings. We propose methods to generate policy summarizations that capture task ordering and agent cooperation in decentralized MARL policies, along with query-based explanations for When, Why Not, and What types of user queries about specific agent behaviors. We evaluate our approach across four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, demonstrating its generalizability and computational efficiency. User studies show that our summarizations and explanations significantly improve user question-answering performance and enhance subjective ratings on metrics such as understanding and satisfaction.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is a powerful inductive mechanism, widely used in human cognition and increasingly applied in artificial intelligence. Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions. Our results offer a general theory of analogical inference across discrete and continuous domains.

Conclusion: 基于证明的逐步解释生成方法在保持解释质量的同时大幅提高了效率，扩展了逐步解释技术的应用范围。

Abstract: In the field of Explainable Constraint Solving, it is common to explain to a user why a problem is unsatisfiable. A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small. Our results show our method significantly speeds up the generation of step-wise explanation sequences, while the resulting step-wise explanation has a quality similar to the current state-of-the-art.

Result: 在数独和逻辑网格谜题上使用人工用户进行评估，并通过真实用户验证。在两种设置下，MACHOP始终比标准方法产生更高质量的解释。

Conclusion: 交互式偏好学习可以有效地用于优化分步解释的质量，MACHOP方法在生成高质量解释方面表现优于标准方法。

Abstract: Step-wise explanations can explain logic puzzles and other satisfaction problems by showing how to derive decisions step by step. Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation. In both settings, MACHOP consistently produces higher-quality explanations than the standard approach.

Abstract: Standpoint logics offer unified modal logic-based formalisms for representing multiple heterogeneous viewpoints. At the same time, many non-monotonic reasoning frameworks can be naturally captured using modal logics, in particular using the modal logic S4F. In this work, we propose a novel formalism called S4F Standpoint Logic, which generalises both S4F and standpoint propositional logic and is therefore capable of expressing multi-viewpoint, non-monotonic semantic commitments. We define its syntax and semantics and analyze its computational complexity, obtaining the result that S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Topic Modeling methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping how research is conceived, conducted, and communicated across fields from chemistry to biomedicine. This commentary examines how AI is transforming the research workflow. AI systems now help researchers manage the information deluge, filtering the literature, surfacing cross-disciplinary links for ideas and collaborations, generating hypotheses, and designing and executing experiments. These developments mark a shift from AI as a mere computational tool to AI as an active collaborator in science. Yet this transformation demands thoughtful integration and governance. We argue that at this time AI must augment but not replace human judgment in academic workflows such as peer review, ethical evaluation, and validation of results. This paper calls for the deliberate adoption of AI within the scientific practice through policies that promote transparency, reproducibility, and accountability.

Motivation: 在教育和就业等高风险领域中，资源分配需要平衡短期效用与长期影响，同时考虑延迟结果、隐藏异质性和伦理约束。现有方法大多假设即时反馈或忽略个体特征与干预动态的复杂交互。

Method: 双层上下文老虎机框架：元层优化子组级预算分配以满足公平和运营约束；基层使用神经网络识别每个组内最响应的个体，同时考虑冷却窗口和通过资源特定延迟核建模的延迟处理效应。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集（教育和劳动力发展）上的验证表明，该方法实现了更高的累积结果、更好地适应延迟结构，并确保子组间的公平分配。

Conclusion: 延迟感知的数据驱动决策系统有潜力改善机构政策和社会福利，通过显式建模时间动态和反馈延迟，使决策更加响应和自适应。

Abstract: Equitably allocating limited resources in high-stakes domains-such as education, employment, and healthcare-requires balancing short-term utility with long-term impact, while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of delay-aware, data-driven decision-making systems to improve institutional policy and social welfare.

The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency. Additionally, RG's ecosystem includes an editor with LSP, automaton visualization, benchmarking tools, and a debugger of game description transformations.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.

Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is frequently employed as a dimension reduction tool when the number of covariates is large. However, the number of principal components to be retained in PCA is typically determined in a researcher-dependent manner. To mitigate the subjectivity in PCA, this paper proposes a data-driven testing procedure to estimate the number of underlying principal components. While existing work such as G'Sell et al. (2016), Taylor et al. (2016) and Choi et al. (2017) discuss similar tests under fixed design, this paper investigates an extension of their framework to a more general econometric setup with the random design. The proposed test is proved to achieve asymptotically exact type 1 error controls under a locally defined null hypothesis, with simulation examples indicating an asymptotic validity of our test.

Abstract: This work provides the first finite-time convergence guarantees for linearly constrained stochastic bilevel optimization using only first-order methods, requiring solely gradient information without any Hessian computations or second-order derivatives. We address the unprecedented challenge of simultaneously handling linear constraints, stochastic noise, and finite-time analysis in bilevel optimization, a combination that has remained theoretically intractable until now. While existing approaches either require second-order information, handle only unconstrained stochastic problems, or provide merely asymptotic convergence results, our method achieves finite-time guarantees using gradient-based techniques alone. We develop a novel framework that constructs hypergradient approximations via smoothed penalty functions, using approximate primal and dual solutions to overcome the fundamental challenges posed by the interaction between linear constraints and stochastic noise. Our theoretical analysis provides explicit finite-time bounds on the bias and variance of the hypergradient estimator, demonstrating how approximation errors interact with stochastic perturbations. We prove that our first-order algorithm converges to $(δ, ε)$-Goldstein stationary points using $Θ(δ^{-1}ε^{-5})$ stochastic gradient evaluations, establishing the first finite-time complexity result for this challenging problem class and representing a significant theoretical breakthrough in constrained stochastic bilevel optimization.

Conclusion: 混合周期性时刻表能够有效提高时刻表的灵活性和需求响应能力，同时优化乘客出行体验。

Abstract: Periodic timetables are widely adopted in passenger railway operations due to their regular service patterns and well-coordinated train connections. However, fluctuations in passenger demand require varying train services across different periods, necessitating adjustments to the periodic timetable. This study addresses a hybrid periodic train timetabling problem, which enhances the flexibility and demand responsiveness of a given periodic timetable through schedule adjustments and aperiodic train insertions, taking into account the rolling stock circulation. Since timetable modifications may affect initial passenger routes, passenger routing is incorporated into the problem to guide planning decisions towards a passenger-oriented objective. Using a time-space network representation, the problem is formulated as a dynamic railway service network design model with resource constraints. To handle the complexity of real-world instances, we propose a decomposition-based algorithm integrating Benders decomposition and column generation, enhanced with multiple preprocessing and accelerating techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and highlight the advantage of hybrid periodic timetables in reducing passenger travel costs.

Abstract: Gradient descent dynamics on the deep matrix factorization problem is extensively studied as a simplified theoretical model for deep neural networks. Although the convergence theory for two-layer matrix factorization is well-established, no global convergence guarantee for general deep matrix factorization under random initialization has been established to date. To address this gap, we provide a polynomial-time global convergence guarantee for randomly initialized gradient descent on four-layer matrix factorization, given certain conditions on the target matrix and a standard balanced regularization term. Our analysis employs new techniques to show saddle-avoidance properties of gradient decent dynamics, and extends previous theories to characterize the change in eigenvalues of layer weights.

Abstract: This paper concerns a class of constrained optimization problems in which, the objective and constraint functions are both upper-$\mathcal{C}^2$. For such nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems, we develop an inexact moving balls approximation (MBA) method by a workable inexactness criterion for the solving of subproblems. By leveraging a global error bound for the strongly convex program associated with parametric optimization problems, we establish the full convergence of the iterate sequence under the partial bounded multiplier property (BMP) and the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) property of the constructed potential function, and achieve the local convergence rate of the iterate and objective value sequences if the potential function satisfies the KL property of exponent $q\in[1/2,1)$. A verifiable condition is also provided to check whether the potential function satisfies the KL property of exponent $q\in[1/2,1)$ at the given critical point. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementable inexact MBA method with a full convergence certificate for the constrained nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problem.

Abstract: In this work we study an age-structured chemostat model with a renewal boundary condition and a coupled substrate equation. The model is nonlinear and consists of a hyperbolic partial differential equation and an ordinary differential equation with nonlinear, nonlocal terms appearing both in the ordinary differential equation and the boundary condition. Both differential equations contain a non-negative control input, while the states of the model are required to be positive. Under an appropriate weak solution framework, we determine the state space and the input space for this model. We prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all admissible initial conditions and all allowable control inputs. To this purpose we employ a combination of Banach's fixed-point theorem with implicit solution formulas and useful solution estimates. Finally, we show that the age-structured chemostat model gives a well-defined control system on a metric space.

Abstract: An inexact semismooth Newton method has been proposed for solving semi-linear elliptic optimal control problems in this paper. This method incorporates the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method, a type of Krylov subspace method, to solve the Newton equations and utilizes nonmonotonic line search to adjust the iteration step size. The original problem is reformulated into a nonlinear equation through variational inequality principles and discretized using a second-order finite difference scheme. By leveraging slanting differentiability, the algorithm constructs semismooth Newton directions and employs GMRES method to inexactly solve the Newton equations, significantly reducing computational overhead. A dynamic nonmonotonic line search strategy is introduced to adjust stepsizes adaptively, ensuring global convergence while overcoming local stagnation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves superlinear convergence near optimal solutions when the residual control parameter $η_k$ approaches to 0. Numerical experiments validate the method's accuracy and efficiency in solving semilinear elliptic optimal control problems, corroborating theoretical insights.

Conclusion: S-D-RSM在理论和实践上均表现出色，验证了其理论保证的有效性，并在压缩感知和实证风险最小化等实际任务中展示了优越性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problems large-scale distributed composite convex optimization, with motivations from a broad range of applications, including multi-agent systems, federated learning, smart grids, wireless sensor networks, compressed sensing, and so on. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants are commonly employed to solve such problems. However, existing algorithms often rely on vanishing step sizes, strong convexity assumptions, or entail substantial computational overhead to ensure convergence or obtain favorable complexity. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we integrate consensus optimization and operator splitting techniques (see Problem Reformulation) to develop a novel stochastic splitting algorithm, termed the \emph{stochastic distributed regularized splitting method} (S-D-RSM). In practice, S-D-RSM performs parallel updates of proximal mappings and gradient information for only a randomly selected subset of agents at each iteration. By introducing regularization terms, it effectively mitigates consensus discrepancies among distributed nodes. In contrast to conventional stochastic methods, our theoretical analysis establishes that S-D-RSM achieves global convergence without requiring diminishing step sizes or strong convexity assumptions. Furthermore, it achieves an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/ε)$ with respect to both the objective function value and the consensus error. Numerical experiments show that S-D-RSM achieves up to 2--3$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy. These results not only validate the algorithm's theoretical guarantees but also demonstrate its effectiveness in practical tasks such as compressed sensing and empirical risk minimization.

Conclusion: 尽管理论保证全局O(1/k)收敛，但实际观察到瞬态O(1/k^2)收敛速率，随后是渐近线性收敛，这种两阶段行为可由所提出的平滑规则解释。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive accelerated smoothing technique for a nonsmooth convex optimization problem where the smoothing update rule is coupled with the momentum parameter. We also extend the setting to the case where the objective function is the sum of two nonsmooth functions. With regard to convergence rate, we provide the global (optimal) sublinear convergence guarantees of O(1/k), which is known to be provably optimal for the studied class of functions, along with a local linear rate if the nonsmooth term fulfills a so-call locally strong convexity condition. We validate the performance of our algorithm on several problem classes, including regression with the l1-norm (the Lasso problem), sparse semidefinite programming (the MaxCut problem), Nuclear norm minimization with application in model free fault diagnosis, and l_1-regularized model predictive control to showcase the benefits of the coupling. An interesting observation is that although our global convergence result guarantees O(1/k) convergence, we consistently observe a practical transient convergence rate of O(1/k^2), followed by asymptotic linear convergence as anticipated by the theoretical result. This two-phase behavior can also be explained in view of the proposed smoothing rule.

Abstract: This paper investigates a Halpern acceleration of the inexact proximal point method for solving maximal monotone inclusion problems in Hilbert spaces. The proposed Halpern inexact proximal point method (HiPPM) is shown to be globally convergent, and a unified framework is developed to analyze its worst-case convergence rate. Under mild summability conditions on the inexactness tolerances, HiPPM achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/k^{2})$ rate in terms of the squared fixed-point residual. Furthermore, under additional mild condition, the method retains a fast linear convergence rate. Building upon this framework, we further extend the acceleration technique to constrained convex optimization through the augmented Lagrangian formulation. In analogy to Rockafellar's classical results, the resulting accelerated inexact augmented Lagrangian method inherits the convergence rate and complexity guarantees of HiPPM. The analysis thus provides a unified theoretical foundation for accelerated inexact proximal algorithms and their augmented Lagrangian extensions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the generalized descent algorithm (DEAL) for minimizing smooth functions, which is analyzed under the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) inequality. In particular, the suggested algorithm guarantees a sufficient decrease by adapting to the cost function's geometry. We leverage the KL property to establish the global convergence, convergence rates, and complexity. A particular focus is placed on the linear convergence of generalized descent methods. We show that the constant step-size and Armijo line search strategies along a generalized descent direction satisfy our generalized descent condition. Additionally, for nonsmooth functions by leveraging the smoothing techniques such as forward-backward and high-order Moreau envelopes, we show that the boosted proximal gradient method (BPGA) and the boosted high-order proximal-point (BPPA) methods are also specific cases of DEAL, respectively. It is notable that if the order of the high-order proximal term is chosen in a certain way (depending on the KL exponent), then the sequence generated by BPPA converges linearly for an arbitrary KL exponent. Our preliminary numerical experiments on inverse problems and LASSO demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods, validating our theoretical findings.

Abstract: This paper studies the fundamental properties of the high-order forward-backward splitting mapping (HiFBS) and its associated forward-backward envelope (HiFBE) through the lens of high-order regularization for nonconvex composite functions. Specifically, we (i) establish the boundedness and uniform boundedness of HiFBS, along with the Hölder and Lipschitz continuity of HiFBE; (ii) derive an explicit form for the subdifferentials of HiFBE; and (iii) investigate necessary and sufficient conditions for the differentiability and weak smoothness of HiFBE under suitable assumptions. By leveraging the prox-regularity of $g$ and the concept of $p$-calmness, we further demonstrate the local single-valuedness and continuity of HiFBS, which in turn guarantee the differentiability of HiFBE in neighborhoods of calm points. This paves the way for the development of gradient-based algorithms tailored to nonconvex composite optimization problems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the unconstrained minimization of smooth convex functions whose gradients are locally Holder continuous. Building on these results, we analyze the Scaled Gradient Algorithm (SGA) under local smoothness assumptions, proving its global convergence and iteration complexity. Furthermore, under local strong convexity and the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) inequality, we establish linear convergence rates and provide explicit complexity bounds. In particular, we show that when the gradient is locally Lipschitz continuous, SGA attains linear convergence for any KL exponent. We then introduce and analyze an adaptive variant of SGA (AdaSGA), which automatically adjusts the scaling and step-size parameters. For this method, we show global convergence, and derive local linear rates under strong convexity.

*Florian Messerer,Yunfan Gao,Jonathan Frey,Moritz Diehl*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Riccati-ZORO是一种用于基于管的优化控制问题的算法，通过交替优化名义轨迹和不确定性管来降低计算复杂度，从O(n_x^6)降至O(n_x^3)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管优化控制问题通过预测轨迹管来捕捉预测不确定性，但反馈律的在线计算具有挑战性，且回退项会显著影响性能。

Method: 算法交替求解两个子问题：固定回退项的名义优化控制问题，以及固定名义轨迹的无约束管优化控制问题，后者优化反馈增益以减少回退项。

Result: 在线性状态反馈下的椭球管情况下，该分解将计算复杂度从O(n_x^6)显著降低到O(n_x^3)，相当于名义优化控制问题的复杂度。

Conclusion: Riccati-ZORO算法有效降低了基于管的优化控制问题的计算复杂度，并在数值实验中验证了其性能，提供了开源实现。

Abstract: We present Riccati-ZORO, an algorithm for tube-based optimal control problems (OCP). Tube OCPs predict a tube of trajectories in order to capture predictive uncertainty. The tube induces a constraint tightening via additional backoff terms. This backoff can significantly affect the performance, and thus implicitly defines a cost of uncertainty. Optimizing the feedback law used to predict the tube can significantly reduce the backoffs, but its online computation is challenging.
  Riccati-ZORO jointly optimizes the nominal trajectory and uncertainty tube based on a heuristic uncertainty cost design. The algorithm alternates between two subproblems: (i) a nominal OCP with fixed backoffs, (ii) an unconstrained tube OCP, which optimizes the feedback gains for a fixed nominal trajectory. For the tube optimization, we propose a cost function informed by the proximity of the nominal trajectory to constraints, prioritizing reduction of the corresponding backoffs. These ideas are developed in detail for ellipsoidal tubes under linear state feedback. In this case, the decomposition into the two subproblems yields a substantial reduction of the computational complexity with respect to the state dimension from $\mathcal{O}(n_x^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n_x^3)$, i.e., the complexity of a nominal OCP.
  We investigate the algorithm in numerical experiments, and provide two open-source implementations: a prototyping version in CasADi and a high-performance implementation integrated into the acados OCP solver.

Motivation: 需要一种有效的凸锥间差异度量方法，特别是在图像集分类等应用中，其中图像集可建模为多面体锥。

Method: 使用基于最大最小角度的新度量，对多面体锥采用非凸切割平面方法计算，基于Kelley切割平面算法的定制版本。

Result: 该度量与Pompeiu-Hausdorff距离相关，在特定锥配置下可简化计算，算法可得到满足必要最优性条件的角度。

Conclusion: 提出的数学和算法框架在小样本学习中的图像集分类任务中有效，能判断两个图像集是否属于同一类别。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel dissimilarity measure between two convex cones, based on the max-min angle between them. We demonstrate that this measure is closely related to the Pompeiu-Hausdorff distance, a well-established metric for comparing compact sets. Furthermore, we examine cone configurations where the measure admits simplified or analytic forms. For the specific case of polyhedral cones, a nonconvex cutting-plane method is deployed to compute, at least approximately, the measure between them. Our approach builds on a tailored version of Kelley's cutting-plane algorithm, which involves solving a challenging master program per iteration. When this master program is solved locally, our method yields an angle that satisfies certain necessary optimality conditions of the underlying nonconvex optimization problem yielding the dissimilarity measure between the cones. As an application of the proposed mathematical and algorithmic framework, we address the image-set classification task under limited data conditions, a task that falls within the scope of the \emph{Few-Shot Learning} paradigm. In this context, image sets belonging to the same class are modeled as polyhedral cones, and our dissimilarity measure proves useful for understanding whether two image sets belong to the same class.

Abstract: The construction of low-discrepancy sets, used for uniform sampling and numerical integration, has recently seen great improvements based on optimization and machine learning techniques. However, these methods are computationally expensive, often requiring days of computation or access to GPU clusters. We show that simple gradient descent-based techniques allow for comparable results when starting with a reasonably uniform point set. Not only is this method much more efficient and accessible, but it can be applied as post-processing to any low-discrepancy set generation method for a variety of standard discrepancy measures.

Motivation: 现有分支传输模型主要处理静态质量分布，无法有效建模源和目标质量分布随时间周期性变化的运输网络问题，如交通流和血液循环系统。

Method: 引入了时变传输路径的概念，定义了相关的能量和距离度量，证明了存在能量达到距离的传输路径，并建立了度量结构。

Abstract: We develop a new framework for branched transport between probability measures which are allowed to vary in time. This framework can be used to model problems where the underlying transportation network displays a branched structure, but the source and target mass distributions can change cyclically over time, such as road networks or circulatory systems. We introduce the notion of time-dependent transport paths along with associated energies and distances, and prove existence of transport paths whose energy achieves the distance. We also show the time-dependent transport yields a metric structure on subsets of appropriately defined measure-valued Sobolev spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分析通常只能在有限条件下提供局部保证，需要一种能够量化SCP算法在指定问题族中所有实例上性能的全局验证方法

Method: 将验证问题构建为优化问题，在参数集约束下最大化性能指标，同时确保迭代序列符合SCP更新规则

Result: 该框架为参数化设置中的SCP算法首次提供了全局最坏情况保证，在控制、信号处理和运筹学应用中得到了验证

Conclusion: 该验证框架能够为各种SCP变体提供精确的全局性能保证，填补了现有分析方法的空白

Abstract: We introduce a verification framework to exactly verify the worst-case performance of sequential convex programming (SCP) algorithms for parametric non-convex optimization. The verification problem is formulated as an optimization problem that maximizes a performance metric (e.g., the suboptimality after a given number of iterations) over parameters constrained to be in a parameter set and iterate sequences consistent with the SCP update rules. Our framework is general, extending the notion of SCP to include both conventional variants such as trust-region, convex-concave, and prox-linear methods, and algorithms that combine convex subproblems with rounding steps, as in relaxing and rounding schemes. Unlike existing analyses that may only provide local guarantees under limited conditions, our framework delivers global worst-case guarantees--quantifying how well an SCP algorithm performs across all problem instances in the specified family. Applications in control, signal processing, and operations research demonstrate that our framework provides, for the first time, global worst-case guarantees for SCP algorithms in the parametric setting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个能可证明地求解具有隐藏凸性的非凸优化问题到全局最优解的算法，包括非光滑情况下的近端点方法和光滑情况下的束水平方法，无需约束条件且复杂度与无约束隐藏凸优化相匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多应用中的约束非凸优化问题实际上具有隐藏凸性，但变换通常是隐式或未知的，而原始变量的(次)梯度通常可访问，这促使开发直接在原始非凸空间中操作的算法。

Method: 使用改进的不精确近端点方法处理非光滑问题，提出基于线性约束二次子问题的束水平类型方法处理光滑问题。

Conclusion: 尽管问题是非凸的，但所提出的方法学无需约束条件，能处理隐藏凸等式约束，且复杂度与求解无约束隐藏凸优化问题相匹配。

Abstract: Constrained non-convex optimization is fundamentally challenging, as global solutions are generally intractable and constraint qualifications may not hold. However, in many applications, including safe policy optimization in control and reinforcement learning, such problems possess hidden convexity, meaning they can be reformulated as convex programs via a nonlinear invertible transformation. Typically such transformations are implicit or unknown, making the direct link with the convex program impossible. On the other hand, (sub-)gradients with respect to the original variables are often accessible or can be easily estimated, which motivates algorithms that operate directly in the original (non-convex) problem space using standard (sub-)gradient oracles. In this work, we develop the first algorithms to provably solve such non-convex problems to global minima. First, using a modified inexact proximal point method, we establish global last-iterate convergence guarantees with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ oracle complexity in non-smooth setting. For smooth problems, we propose a new bundle-level type method based on linearly constrained quadratic subproblems, improving the oracle complexity to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-1})$. Surprisingly, despite non-convexity, our methodology does not require any constraint qualifications, can handle hidden convex equality constraints, and achieves complexities matching those for solving unconstrained hidden convex optimization.

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种方法来增强UPSA投资组合优化器的稳健性：时间平均最优惩罚权重和使用平均Oracle相关特征值来减少协方差矩阵的噪声和对协变量偏移的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UPSA虽然通过小校准窗口和交叉验证优化实现夏普比率，但仍受金融数据中大量噪声的影响，需要提高对估计噪声和协变量偏移的稳健性。

Method: 1. 对最优惩罚权重进行时间平均；2. 使用平均Oracle相关特征值来降噪协方差矩阵并提高对协变量偏移的稳健性。

Result: 结合这两种长期平均方法在大多数规格下都大幅优于原始UPSA。

Conclusion: 通过时间平均和特征值降噪可以显著提高UPSA投资组合优化器的稳健性和效率。

Abstract: We enhance the Universal Portfolio Shrinkage Approximator (UPSA) of Kelly et al. (2023) by making it more robust with respect to estimation noise and covariate shift. UPSA optimizes the realized Sharpe ratio using a relatively small calibration window, leveraging ridge penalties and cross-validation to yield better portfolios. Yet, it still suffers from the staggering amount of noise in financial data. We propose two methods to make UPSA more robust and improve its efficiency: time-averaging of the optimal penalty weights and using the Average Oracle correlation eigenvalues to make covariance matrices less noisy and more robust to covariate shift. Combining these two long-term averages outperforms UPSA by a large margin in most specifications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于有向二分图编码器的自动化ICD编码方法，通过建模常见代码与罕见代码之间的细粒度共现关系，利用条件概率引导信息从常见代码流向罕见代码，从而改善长尾分布下的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化ICD编码面临大规模标签空间（10,000-20,000个代码）和长尾分布问题，许多罕见代码缺乏足够的训练数据，需要有效利用代码间的共现关系来提升罕见代码的分类性能。

Method: 构建有向二分图编码器，将常见代码和罕见代码作为不相交节点集，边仅从常见代码指向罕见代码。基于条件概率的偏置注入注意力模块（共现编码），利用大语言模型生成代码描述来丰富初始嵌入。

Result: 在三个自动化ICD编码基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，特别是在长尾分类关键指标Macro-F1上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过建模代码间的细粒度共现关系，特别是利用常见代码的信息来增强罕见代码表示，可以有效解决ICD编码中的长尾分布问题，提升整体分类性能。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合专家模型在生存分析中虽然能聚类相似患者，但往往以牺牲校准误差和预测准确性为代价，因为其限制性归纳偏置要求个体预测必须与其所属群体的预测相似。

Method: 引入了多种离散时间深度混合专家架构，比较了不同表达能力的专家模型，发现更具表达能力的专家能够为每个患者定制预测。

Result: 研究发现，更具表达能力的专家模型（能够为每个患者定制预测）优于依赖固定群体原型的专家模型。

Conclusion: 通过使用更具表达能力的专家，可以在发现患者群体结构的同时改善校准和预测准确性。

Abstract: Deep mixture-of-experts models have attracted a lot of attention for survival analysis problems, particularly for their ability to cluster similar patients together. In practice, grouping often comes at the expense of key metrics such calibration error and predictive accuracy. This is due to the restrictive inductive bias that mixture-of-experts imposes, that predictions for individual patients must look like predictions for the group they're assigned to. Might we be able to discover patient group structure, where it exists, while improving calibration and predictive accuracy? In this work, we introduce several discrete-time deep mixture-of-experts (MoE) based architectures for survival analysis problems, one of which achieves all desiderata: clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy. We show that a key differentiator between this array of MoEs is how expressive their experts are. We find that more expressive experts that tailor predictions per patient outperform experts that rely on fixed group prototypes.

Motivation: 传统跳马尔可夫系统的状态估计方法需要已知噪声统计和模式转换动态，这在现实应用中往往不可得。现有深度学习方法缺乏模型结构，在复杂系统中表现受限。

Method: 提出混合架构，包含两个RNN：一个用于模式预测，另一个基于KalmanNet的扩展版本进行滤波。采用交替最小二乘策略联合训练，无需潜在模式的监督。

Result: 在线性和非线性系统（目标跟踪、摆角跟踪、Lorenz吸引子等）上的实验表明，JMFNet在非平稳和高噪声环境下优于传统方法，相比KalmanNet在复杂系统或长轨迹中表现更优。

Conclusion: JMFNet提供了一个可靠的状态估计框架，对初始条件、超参数选择和模型知识错误具有低敏感性，在复杂系统中表现稳定。

Abstract: This paper presents the Jump Markov Filtering Network (JMFNet), a novel model-based deep learning framework for real-time state-state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown noise statistics and mode transition dynamics. A hybrid architecture comprising two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed: one for mode prediction and another for filtering that is based on a mode-augmented version of the recently presented KalmanNet architecture. The proposed RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy that enables mutual adaptation without supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems, including target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed JMFNet framework outperforms classical model-based filters (e.g., interacting multiple models and particle filters) as well as model-free deep learning baselines, particularly in non-stationary and high-noise regimes. It is also showcased that JMFNet achieves a small yet meaningful improvement over the KalmanNet framework, which becomes much more pronounced in complicated systems or long trajectories. Finally, the method's performance is empirically validated to be consistent and reliable, exhibiting low sensitivity to initial conditions, hyperparameter selection, as well as to incorrect model knowledge

Motivation: 许多自然科学中的机器学习任务具有特定的对称性，但等变方法往往未被采用，可能是因为训练困难、期望模型自行学习对称性，或等变实现被认为复杂。群平均技术为解决这些问题提供了可行方案。

Method: 在测试时对训练好的模型进行群平均操作，即对模型在对称群上的输出进行平均，该方法成本与群大小成正比，且不要求模型结构或训练过程的任何改变。

Result: 实验表明，群平均总能降低平均评估损失，在VRMSE指标上提升高达37%，对连续动力学产生视觉上更好的预测结果。

Conclusion: 在常见情况下，施加精确对称性没有缺点，群平均是提高模型精度的廉价且简单的方法，ML4PS社区应考虑采用。

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks in the natural sciences are precisely equivariant to particular symmetries. Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics. This short paper shows that, under certain common circumstances, there are no disadvantages to imposing exact symmetries; the ML4PS community should consider group averaging as a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework based on a guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that leverages surrogate gradients to generate heat sink designs minimizing pressure drop while maintaining surface temperatures below a specified threshold. Geometries are represented using boundary representations of multiple fins, and a multi-fidelity approach is employed to generate training data. Using this dataset, along with vectors representing the boundary representation geometries, we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate heat sinks with characteristics consistent with those observed in the data. We train two different residual neural networks to predict the pressure drop and surface temperature for each geometry. We use the gradients of these surrogate models with respect to the design variables to guide the geometry generation process toward satisfying the low-pressure and surface temperature constraints. This inference-time guidance directs the generative process toward heat sink designs that not only prevent overheating but also achieve lower pressure drops compared to traditional optimization methods such as CMA-ES. In contrast to traditional black-box optimization approaches, our method is scalable, provided sufficient training data is available. Unlike traditional topology optimization methods, once the model is trained and the heat sink world model is saved, inference under new constraints (e.g., temperature) is computationally inexpensive and does not require retraining. Samples generated using the guided diffusion model achieve pressure drops up to 10 percent lower than the limits obtained by traditional black-box optimization methods. This work represents a step toward building a foundational generative model for electronics cooling.

Conclusion: 环境作为经验数据生产者对智能体智能发展至关重要，需要向更复杂、真实和交互的方向扩展。本文为未来智能体智能研究提供了方向性指导。

Abstract: LLM-based agents can autonomously accomplish complex tasks across various domains. However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze benchmarks, implementation strategies, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.

Abstract: There is a growing body of work on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations of circuits, focusing primarily on their static characteristics. However, these models fail to capture circuit runtime behavior, which is crucial for tasks like circuit verification and optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce DR-GNN (DynamicRTL-GNN), a novel approach that learns RTL circuit representations by incorporating both static structures and multi-cycle execution behaviors. DR-GNN leverages an operator-level Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to represent Register Transfer Level (RTL) circuits, enabling the model to capture dynamic dependencies and runtime execution. To train and evaluate DR-GNN, we build the first comprehensive dynamic circuit dataset, comprising over 6,300 Verilog designs and 63,000 simulation traces. Our results demonstrate that DR-GNN outperforms existing models in branch hit prediction and toggle rate prediction. Furthermore, its learned representations transfer effectively to related dynamic circuit tasks, achieving strong performance in power estimation and assertion prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GFlowNets在实践中往往难以均匀探索奖励景观：容易到达区域的轨迹主导训练，而难以到达的模式梯度信息不足，导致高奖励区域覆盖不足。

Method: 采用顺序训练集成GFlowNets的方法，每个后续模型优化残差奖励，补偿前序模型已捕获的质量，重新激活未充分探索区域的学习信号。

Result: 在合成多模态基准和肽设计任务中，Boosted GFlowNets实现了显著更好的探索和样本多样性，同时保持了标准轨迹平衡训练的稳定性和简单性。

Conclusion: Boosted GFlowNets通过残差原则解决了GFlowNets的探索不平衡问题，在保持训练稳定性的同时显著提升了样本多样性和高奖励区域的覆盖。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful samplers for compositional objects that, by design, sample proportionally to a given non-negative reward. Nonetheless, in practice, they often struggle to explore the reward landscape evenly: trajectories toward easy-to-reach regions dominate training, while hard-to-reach modes receive vanishing or uninformative gradients, leading to poor coverage of high-reward areas. We address this imbalance with Boosted GFlowNets, a method that sequentially trains an ensemble of GFlowNets, each optimizing a residual reward that compensates for the mass already captured by previous models. This residual principle reactivates learning signals in underexplored regions and, under mild assumptions, ensures a monotone non-degradation property: adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it. Empirically, Boosted GFlowNets achieve substantially better exploration and sample diversity on multimodal synthetic benchmarks and peptide design tasks, while preserving the stability and simplicity of standard trajectory-balance training.

TL;DR: SPAttention通过引入原则性结构稀疏性，将多头注意力计算从H个独立的O(N²)计算转换为单个协作的O(N²)计算，将复杂度降低H倍，同时保持性能与标准密集注意力相当甚至更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM核心注意力机制中计算复杂度O(H·N²)与表达能力之间的冲突，现有稀疏方法往往以信息完整性为代价换取计算效率。

Method: 采用原则性结构稀疏性，将总注意力工作负载划分为平衡、非重叠的距离带，为每个头分配独特片段，实现多头注意力的协作计算。

Result: 在OLMoE-1B-7B和0.25B-1.75B模型系列上验证，训练吞吐量提高约两倍，性能与标准密集注意力相当甚至更好，在所有评估指标上均优于Longformer、Reformer和BigBird等稀疏方法。

Conclusion: SPAttention通过结构稀疏性有效解决了效率-性能权衡问题，为LLM设计提供了新的高效注意力范式。

Abstract: The design of Large Language Models (LLMs) has long been hampered by a fundamental conflict within their core attention mechanism: its remarkable expressivity is built upon a computational complexity of $O(H \cdot N^2)$ that grows quadratically with the context size ($N$) and linearly with the number of heads ($H$). This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from $H$ independent $O(N^2)$ computations into a single, collaborative $O(N^2)$ computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of $H$. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Extensive empirical validation on the OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B model series demonstrates that while delivering an approximately two-fold increase in training throughput, its performance is on par with standard dense attention, even surpassing it on select key metrics, while consistently outperforming representative sparse attention methods including Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Many real-world applications require solving families of expensive multi-objective optimization problems~(EMOPs) under varying operational conditions. This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes. Meanwhile, empirical studies in synthetic and real-world benchmarks further verify the effectiveness of our alternating framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式去噪模型在生成建模中表现出色，但缺乏严格的逼近理论支撑。本文旨在为这类模型建立数学基础，证明增量生成在通用逼近中的必要性。

Method: 使用拓扑动力学论证证明单步自治流无法实现通用逼近，然后利用自治流的代数性质，证明通过组合多个流可以实现对方向保持同胚的逼近。

Result: 证明了每个方向保持Lipschitz同胚都可以通过最多K_d个流的组合以O(n^{-1/d})的速率逼近，在额外平滑性假设下可实现维度无关的逼近速率。

Conclusion: 增量生成是流式去噪模型实现通用逼近的关键，通过多步流组合可以克服单步流的局限性，为这类模型提供了坚实的数学基础。

Abstract: Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.

Motivation: 传统强化学习的目标函数缺乏风险敏感性，这在医疗和金融等领域至关重要。通过优化累积奖励分布的特定分位数可以更好地控制风险。

Method: UCB-QRL是一种乐观学习算法，在每次迭代中首先估计转移概率，然后在置信球内优化分位数价值函数。

Conclusion: UCB-QRL为风险敏感的强化学习提供了有效的解决方案，能够处理分位数优化问题并获得理论保证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in recent years. However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance. A popular approach to incorporate risk sensitivity is to optimize a specific quantile of the cumulative reward distribution. In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $τ$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate. We show that UCB-QRL yields a high-probability regret bound $\mathcal O\left((2/κ)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/δ)}\right)$ in the episodic setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and $H$ horizons. Here, $κ>0$ is a problem-dependent constant that captures the sensitivity of the underlying MDP's quantile value.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了表格深度学习需要大量合成或真实数据预训练的传统观点，发现仅用单个真实表格进行自监督预训练就能实现跨领域的强泛化能力，并揭示了任务构建数量和质量对下游性能的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前表格深度学习领域认为需要大规模合成数据（如TabPFN先验）或大量真实数据（如TabDPT训练集）才能实现泛化的主流观点，探索更高效的数据利用方式。

Method: 通过在多个不同数据集上进行系统性的自监督预训练和评估，分析数据的关键特征对构建跨领域泛化的表格基础模型（TFM）的影响，并研究预训练过程中任务构建的重要性。

Result: 发现仅使用单个真实表格进行自监督预训练就能产生令人惊讶的跨异构基准测试的强泛化能力，相对少量的数据就足以实现泛化。

Conclusion: 构建表格基础模型时，从数据集中构建的任务数量和质量是决定下游性能的关键因素，而非单纯依赖大规模数据预训练。

Abstract: Deep tabular modelling increasingly relies on in-context learning where, during inference, a model receives a set of $(x,y)$ pairs as context and predicts labels for new inputs without weight updates. We challenge the prevailing view that broad generalization here requires pre-training on large synthetic corpora (e.g., TabPFN priors) or a large collection of real data (e.g., TabDPT training datasets), discovering that a relatively small amount of data suffices for generalization. We find that simple self-supervised pre-training on just a \emph{single} real table can produce surprisingly strong transfer across heterogeneous benchmarks. By systematically pre-training and evaluating on many diverse datasets, we analyze what aspects of the data are most important for building a Tabular Foundation Model (TFM) generalizing across domains. We then connect this to the pre-training procedure shared by most TFMs and show that the number and quality of \emph{tasks} one can construct from a dataset is key to downstream performance.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不知道真实参数的情况下有效利用各种学习假设，提供了一种比传统SRM方法更少依赖先验假设的学习框架。

Abstract: We address the general task of learning with a set of candidate models that is too large to have a uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true losses. While the common approach to such challenges is SRM (or regularization) based learning algorithms, we propose a novel learning paradigm that relies on stronger incorporation of empirical data and requires less algorithmic decisions to be based on prior assumptions. We analyze the generalization capabilities of our approach and demonstrate its merits in several common learning assumptions, including similarity of close points, clustering of the domain into highly label-homogeneous regions, Lipschitzness assumptions of the labeling rule, and contrastive learning assumptions. Our approach allows utilizing such assumptions without the need to know their true parameters a priori.

Conclusion: GEM+通过结合自适应测量和神经网络生成器，实现了在差分隐私约束下合成表格数据的质量和可扩展性的显著提升，为高维数据的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art differentially private synthetic tabular data has been defined by adaptive 'select-measure-generate' frameworks, exemplified by methods like AIM. These approaches iteratively measure low-order noisy marginals and fit graphical models to produce synthetic data, enabling systematic optimisation of data quality under privacy constraints. Graphical models, however, are inefficient for high-dimensional data because they require substantial memory and must be retrained from scratch whenever the graph structure changes, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods, like GEM, overcome these limitations by using generator neural networks for improved scalability. However, empirical comparisons have mostly focused on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce GEM+, which integrates AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's scalable generator network. Our experiments show that GEM+ outperforms AIM in both utility and scalability, delivering state-of-the-art results while efficiently handling datasets with over a hundred columns, where AIM fails due to memory and computational overheads.

Abstract: The improving multi-armed bandits problem is a formal model for allocating effort under uncertainty, motivated by scenarios such as investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves. Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $Ω(k)$ and $Ω(\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.

Motivation: 视觉强化学习在视觉控制和机器人领域取得了显著进展，但其对对抗扰动的脆弱性仍未充分探索。现有黑盒攻击主要针对基于向量或离散动作的RL，在基于图像的连续控制中受到大动作空间和过多环境查询的限制。

Method: SEBA集成了影子Q模型（估计对抗条件下的累积奖励）、生成对抗网络（产生视觉不可察觉的扰动）和世界模型（模拟环境动态以减少真实世界查询）。通过两阶段迭代训练程序，交替学习影子模型和优化生成器。

Result: 在MuJoCo和Atari基准测试中，SEBA显著降低了累积奖励，保持了视觉保真度，并且与先前的黑盒和白盒方法相比，大大减少了环境交互次数。

Conclusion: SEBA提供了一个高效的黑盒对抗攻击框架，能够在视觉强化学习环境中实现强大的攻击性能，同时保持样本效率。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable progress in visual control and robotics, but its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Most existing black-box attacks focus on vector-based or discrete-action RL, and their effectiveness on image-based continuous control is limited by the large action space and excessive environment queries. We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks show that SEBA significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在提升Text2SQL LLMs推理能力时，性能高度依赖奖励函数设计，不当的奖励会导致奖励黑客问题，即模型利用奖励结构漏洞获得高分而非真正解决问题。

Result: 在知名Text2SQL数据集上的数值实验证实，该方法相比最先进的RL训练LLMs有所改进。

Conclusion: 该约束RL框架为Text2SQL提供了理论保证，并通过实验验证了其优于现有RL方法的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Text2SQL LLMs, especially with advanced algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. However, the performance of these methods is highly sensitive to the design of reward functions. Inappropriate rewards can lead to reward hacking, where models exploit loopholes in the reward structure to achieve high scores without genuinely solving the task. This work considers a constrained RL framework for Text2SQL that incorporates natural and interpretable reward and constraint signals, while dynamically balancing trade-offs among them during the training. We establish the theoretical guarantees of our constrained RL framework and our numerical experiments on the well-known Text2SQL datasets substantiate the improvement of our approach over the state-of-the-art RL-trained LLMs.

Motivation: MCR作为二进制散射码模型的泛化，旨在提供更高表示能力同时保持轻量化，但缺乏系统分析导致其复杂性被高估。

Conclusion: MCR虽然需要更复杂操作，但其模运算和更高组件精度允许更低维度，在专用硬件上成为更快、更节能的高精度替代方案。

Abstract: The modular composite representation (MCR) is a computing model that represents information with high-dimensional integer vectors using modular arithmetic. Originally proposed as a generalization of the binary spatter code model, it aims to provide higher representational power while remaining a lighter alternative to models requiring high-precision components. Despite this potential, MCR has received limited attention. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs and comparisons with other models are lacking, sustaining the perception that its added complexity outweighs the improved expressivity. In this work, we revisit MCR by presenting its first extensive evaluation, demonstrating that it achieves a unique balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experiments measuring capacity demonstrate that MCR outperforms binary and integer vectors while approaching complex-valued representations at a fraction of their memory footprint. Evaluation on 123 datasets confirms consistent accuracy gains and shows that MCR can match the performance of binary spatter codes using up to 4x less memory. We investigate the hardware realization of MCR by showing that it maps naturally to digital logic and by designing the first dedicated accelerator. Evaluations on basic operations and 7 selected datasets demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude and significant energy reductions compared to software implementation. When matched for accuracy against binary spatter codes, MCR achieves on average 3.08x faster execution and 2.68x lower energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that, although MCR requires more sophisticated operations than binary spatter codes, its modular arithmetic and higher per-component precision enable lower dimensionality. When realized with dedicated hardware, this results in a faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative to existing models.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be prohibitively expensive using traditional numerical methods. Deep learning-based surrogate models typically specialize in a single PDE with fixed parameters. We present a framework for equation-aware emulation that generalizes to unseen PDEs, conditioning a neural model on a vector encoding representing the terms in a PDE and their coefficients. We present a baseline of four distinct modeling technqiues, trained on a family of 1D PDEs from the APEBench suite. Our approach achieves strong performance on parameter sets held out from the training distribution, with strong stability for rollout beyond the training window, and generalization to an entirely unseen PDE.

Abstract: Radar-based precipitation nowcasting, the task of forecasting short-term precipitation fields from previous radar images, is a critical problem for flood risk management and decision-making. While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps. This work positions CFM as a powerful and practical alternative for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting.

Conclusion: Hydra方法有效解决了SFL中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在数据异构环境下，为分裂联邦学习的实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In Split Federated Learning (SFL), the clients collaboratively train a model with the help of a server by splitting the model into two parts. Part-1 is trained locally at each client and aggregated by the aggregator at the end of each round. Part-2 is trained at a server that sequentially processes the intermediate activations received from each client. We study the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in SFL in the presence of data heterogeneity. In detail, due to the nature of SFL, local updates of part-1 may drift away from global optima, while part-2 is sensitive to the processing sequence, similar to forgetting in continual learning (CL). Specifically, we observe that the trained model performs better in classes (labels) seen at the end of the sequence. We investigate this phenomenon with emphasis on key aspects of SFL, such as the processing order at the server and the cut layer. Based on our findings, we propose Hydra, a novel mitigation method inspired by multi-head neural networks and adapted for the SFL's setting. Extensive numerical evaluations show that Hydra outperforms baselines and methods from the literature.

Motivation: 理解神经网络组合结构对优化景观和训练动态的影响，特别是在过参数化设置下，探索梯度流的收敛特性和景观几何的普适性。

Method: 分析过参数化优化问题的梯度流，将其解释为训练具有线性激活的神经网络，使用真解析成本函数进行全局收敛性分析，并引入不平衡度量来评估收敛加速。

Result: 证明了全局收敛性适用于任何真解析成本函数，在标量值成本函数中，关键结构特征（如鞍点位置和稳定性）在所有可接受成本中具有普适性，且收敛速度可通过初始化任意加速。

Conclusion: 神经网络组合结构决定了优化景观的普适特征，这些见解可能推广到具有sigmoid激活的神经网络，展示了超越线性情况的几何和动态特性。

Abstract: This paper investigates how the compositional structure of neural networks shapes their optimization landscape and training dynamics. We analyze the gradient flow associated with overparameterized optimization problems, which can be interpreted as training a neural network with linear activations. Remarkably, we show that the global convergence properties can be derived for any cost function that is proper and real analytic. We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details. Moreover, we show that convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated depending on the initialization, as measured by an imbalance metric introduced in this work. Finally, we discuss how these insights may generalize to neural networks with sigmoidal activations, showing through a simple example which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人控制中环境泛化挑战，特别是在上下文强化学习中，当智能体需要在与训练环境不同的条件下操作时，如何实现OOD泛化。

Method: SPARC：单阶段适应鲁棒控制方法，简化了之前的两阶段训练方法，统一训练上下文编码器和历史适应模块。

Result: 在高保真赛车模拟器Gran Turismo 7和风扰动MuJoCo环境中测试，SPARC实现了可靠且鲁棒的OOD泛化性能。

Conclusion: SPARC方法简化了训练流程，同时在复杂环境中实现了有效的OOD泛化，为机器人控制提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalization to unseen environments is a significant challenge in the field of robotics and control. In this work, we focus on contextual reinforcement learning, where agents act within environments with varying contexts, such as self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots that need to operate in different terrains or weather conditions than they were trained for. We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train. We simplify the methodology and introduce SPARC: single-phase adaptation for robust control. We test SPARC on varying contexts within the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo 7 and wind-perturbed MuJoCo environments, and find that it achieves reliable and robust OOD generalization.

*Houming Wu,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TawPipe是一种拓扑感知的权重管道并行方法，通过利用分布式集群中的分层带宽来优化通信效率，解决了传统管道并行中激活通信开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型受限于设备内存和昂贵的设备间通信。虽然管道并行通过跨设备划分模型来缓解内存压力，但其激活通信开销随序列长度线性增长，限制了长上下文训练的效率。现有的权重传递方法存在冗余的点对点传输和未充分利用的节点内带宽问题。

Method: TawPipe通过以下方式实现：1）基于拓扑对设备进行分组，优化节点内集体通信和节点间点对点通信；2）为每个设备分配固定的模型权重和梯度分片，避免冗余传输；3）将通信与计算重叠以隐藏延迟。与FSDP的全局集体操作不同，TawPipe将大部分通信限制在节点边界内。

Result: 在最多24个GPU上使用LLaMA风格模型进行的广泛实验表明，TawPipe相比最先进的基线方法实现了更优的吞吐量和可扩展性。

Conclusion: TawPipe通过拓扑感知的权重管道并行方法，显著减少了跨节点通信流量，在大型语言模型训练中提供了更高的通信效率和性能。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by limited device memory and costly inter-device communication. Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic. Extensive experiments on up to 24 GPUs with LLaMA-style models show that TawPipe achieves superior throughput and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度线性神经网络梯度流方程的动力学特性和损失景观，揭示其特殊的数学结构，包括无限多全局极小值、鞍点以及缺乏局部极小值和极大值的特性。

Method: 采用邻接矩阵表示法分析梯度流方程，将其表述为一类收敛的矩阵常微分方程，具有幂零、多项式、等谱和守恒定律等特性。

Result: 损失景观包含无限多全局极小值和鞍点（包括严格和非严格鞍点），但没有局部极小值和极大值。损失函数本身是梯度流的正半定Lyapunov函数，其水平集是无界不变临界点集。

Conclusion: 邻接矩阵表示法揭示了损失函数临界值的商空间结构，每个临界值在商空间中只出现一次，其他具有相同临界值的临界点属于相应的纤维。该方法还能轻松确定鞍点的稳定和不稳定子流形。

Abstract: The paper surveys recent progresses in understanding the dynamics and loss landscape of the gradient flow equations associated to deep linear neural networks, i.e., the gradient descent training dynamics (in the limit when the step size goes to 0) of deep neural networks missing the activation functions and subject to quadratic loss functions. When formulated in terms of the adjacency matrix of the neural network, as we do in the paper, these gradient flow equations form a class of converging matrix ODEs which is nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and with conservation laws. The loss landscape is described in detail. It is characterized by infinitely many global minima and saddle points, both strict and nonstrict, but lacks local minima and maxima. The loss function itself is a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function for the gradient flow, and its level sets are unbounded invariant sets of critical points, with critical values that correspond to the amount of singular values of the input-output data learnt by the gradient along a certain trajectory. The adjacency matrix representation we use in the paper allows to highlight the existence of a quotient space structure in which each critical value of the loss function is represented only once, while all other critical points with the same critical value belong to the fiber associated to the quotient space. It also allows to easily determine stable and unstable submanifolds at the saddle points, even when the Hessian fails to obtain them.

*Sarthak Khanna,Armin Berger,Muskaan Chopra,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于宏观经济情境检索的金融预测框架，通过检索历史上相似的宏观经济周期来增强预测的鲁棒性，解决金融市场的非平稳性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场具有内在非平稳性，结构性断裂和宏观经济体制转变常导致预测模型在分布外部署时失效。传统多模态方法简单融合数值指标和文本情感，难以适应这种变化。

Method: 引入宏观情境检索框架，将宏观指标（CPI、失业率、收益率利差、GDP增长等）和金融新闻情感共同嵌入共享相似性空间，在推理时无需重新训练即可检索历史相似宏观经济周期。

Result: 在17年S&P 500数据上训练，并在AAPL和XOM上进行OOD评估，显著缩小了CV到OOD性能差距。宏观条件检索实现了唯一正向的样本外交易结果（AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61）。

Conclusion: 通过实施"金融历史可能不会重演，但常常押韵"的原则，证明宏观感知检索能够在分布变化下产生稳健、可解释的预测，检索到的邻居形成可解释的证据链，对应可识别的宏观情境。

Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary: structural breaks and macroeconomic regime shifts often cause forecasting models to fail when deployed out of distribution (OOD). Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.
  Trained on seventeen years of S&P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts. Beyond metric gains, retrieved neighbors form interpretable evidence chains that correspond to recognizable macro contexts, such as inflationary or yield-curve inversion phases, supporting causal interpretability and transparency. By operationalizing the principle that "financial history may not repeat, but it often rhymes," this work demonstrates that macro-aware retrieval yields robust, explainable forecasts under distributional change.
  All datasets, models, and source code are publicly available.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在恶意噪声和恶意噪声两种对抗性噪声模型下，计算高效学习算法的相对能力和局限性。主要发现在分布无关学习设置中两种噪声模型强等价，但在固定分布设置中存在任意大的分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在对抗性噪声环境下学习布尔函数时，不同噪声模型对计算高效算法的影响，特别关注恶意噪声和恶意噪声这两种具有挑战性的噪声模型。

Method: 通过理论分析和证明，比较分布无关学习和固定分布学习两种设置下，算法对恶意噪声和恶意噪声的容忍能力。定义了忽略矛盾示例（ICE）算法类，并分析其性能。

Result: 分布无关学习中，恶意噪声和恶意噪声强等价；固定分布学习中，两种噪声容忍率存在任意大差距。ICE算法可以将恶意噪声容忍率转换为恶意噪声容忍率，但存在2倍的必要损失。

Conclusion: 噪声模型对学习算法的影响高度依赖于学习设置，ICE算法在两种噪声模型间提供了有意义的联系，但存在固有的性能损失。

Abstract: We consider the relative abilities and limitations of computationally efficient algorithms for learning in the presence of noise, under two well-studied and challenging adversarial noise models for learning Boolean functions: malicious noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a random subset of examples given to the learner; and nasty noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt an adversarially chosen subset of examples given to the learner.
  We consider both the distribution-independent and fixed-distribution settings. Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $η_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $η_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.
  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $η$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $η/2$-rate nasty noise. We further show that the above factor of two is necessary, again under a standard cryptographic assumption.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Belief Net框架，通过将HMM前向滤波器构建为结构化神经网络，使用梯度优化学习HMM参数，相比传统方法收敛更快且能处理谱方法失败的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMM参数学习方法如Baum-Welch算法计算量大且易陷入局部最优，而谱方法虽然具有可证明保证但可能产生无效概率输出，需要一种更高效可靠的方法。

Method: 将HMM前向滤波器构建为结构化神经网络，可学习权重明确对应初始分布、转移矩阵和发射矩阵的对数几率，使用仅解码器架构处理观测序列，通过自回归下一观测预测损失进行端到端训练。

Result: 在合成HMM数据上，Belief Net相比Baum-Welch实现更快的收敛速度，在欠完备和过完备设置下成功恢复参数，而谱方法在这些情况下失败。

Conclusion: Belief Net提供了一种可解释、高效的HMM参数学习方法，在收敛速度和参数恢复能力上优于传统方法，同时保持完全可解释性。

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.

Motivation: 解决现有自动睡眠分期方法在时序层次表达、多模态EEG/EOG融合以及深度学习模型可解释性方面的局限性。

Method: 将30秒epoch分解为3秒子窗口作为"token"，使用CNN分词器和双级Transformer（段内编码和段间集成），通过图卷积网络融合EEG和EOG模态特征。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF数据集上达到85.3%准确率、0.800宏F1和0.796 Cohen's kappa；在ISRUC数据集上达到81.9%准确率、0.802宏F1和0.755 kappa，优于或匹配现有基准。

Conclusion: 通过将睡眠概念化为组合语言，NeuroLingua统一了层次序列建模和多模态融合，为睡眠研究提供了更透明和临床意义的自动分期方法。

Abstract: Automated sleep stage classification from polysomnography remains limited by the lack of expressive temporal hierarchies, challenges in multimodal EEG and EOG fusion, and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose NeuroLingua, a language-inspired framework that conceptualizes sleep as a structured physiological language. Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows ("tokens") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对去中心化GRPO训练的首个对抗攻击，展示了恶意节点如何通过注入恶意令牌来毒化良性模型，攻击成功率可达100%，并提出两种防御方法可将攻击阻止率提升至100%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在大型语言模型后训练中应用广泛，其去中心化特性使得多个节点可以并发处理提示并交换字符串。然而，这种去中心化架构存在安全漏洞，恶意参与者可能通过注入恶意令牌来毒化系统。

Method: 提出了两种对抗攻击方式：上下文外攻击和上下文内攻击。通过数学和编程任务的实证案例，展示了恶意节点如何在良性模型中注入任意恶意令牌，污染其本地LLM后训练。

Result: 攻击在仅50次迭代内即可达到100%的成功率，能够有效毒化良性节点。同时提出的两种防御方法（针对相同模型训练和不同模型训练场景）能够实现高达100%的阻止率。

Conclusion: 去中心化GRPO训练系统存在严重的安全风险，但通过适当的防御机制可以有效抵御对抗攻击，确保训练过程的安全性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated great utilization in post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs). In GRPO, prompts are answered by the model and, through reinforcement learning, preferred completions are learnt. Owing to the small communication volume, GRPO is inherently suitable for decentralised training as the prompts can be concurrently answered by multiple nodes and then exchanged in the forms of strings. In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models. We show that these defenses can achieve stop rates of up to 100%, making the attack impossible.

Conclusion: 该工作阐明了JEPAs的关键行为，为现代自监督学习与动力系统理论建立了原理性联系，指导设计更鲁棒和可解释的时间序列模型。

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), a powerful class of self-supervised models, exhibit an unexplained ability to cluster time-series data by their underlying dynamical regimes. We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement. This work demystifies a key behavior of JEPAs, provides a principled connection between modern self-supervised learning and dynamical systems theory, and informs the design of more robust and interpretable time-series models.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep forecasting models have achieved remarkable performance, yet most approaches still struggle to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task. Furthermore, four variants (CaReTS1--4) are instantiated under this framework to incorporate mainstream temporal modelling encoders, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CaReTS outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in forecasting accuracy, while achieving higher trend classification performance.

Conclusion: 非单调值分解是可行且有效的，无需单调性约束，为未来基于值的MARL算法设计提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Value decomposition is a central approach in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling centralized training with decentralized execution by factorizing the global value function into local values. To ensure individual-global-max (IGM) consistency, existing methods either enforce monotonicity constraints, which limit expressive power, or adopt softer surrogates at the cost of algorithmic complexity. In this work, we present a dynamical systems analysis of non-monotonic value decomposition, modeling learning dynamics as continuous-time gradient flow. We prove that, under approximately greedy exploration, all zero-loss equilibria violating IGM consistency are unstable saddle points, while only IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors of the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments on both synthetic matrix games and challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrate that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms monotonic baselines. Additionally, we investigate the influence of temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies, providing actionable insights for the design of future value-based MARL algorithms.

Motivation: 现实世界中的最佳臂识别问题通常需要满足额外的可行性约束，但现有研究假设性能和约束同时被观察到。然而在实际应用中（如药物发现），性能测试和可行性测试可以分开进行，这需要设计能够决定测试类型的新算法。

Method: 提出了一种可行的BAI算法，允许决策者选择元组(i,ℓ)，其中i表示臂，ℓ表示测试类型（性能测试ℓ=0或可行性约束测试ℓ∈[N]）。算法能够自适应地根据问题难度消除臂，无论是基于较差性能还是不可行性。

Result: 算法在固定置信度设置下能够以至少1-δ的概率识别出具有最高性能的可行臂。理论分析表明算法具有渐近最优的样本复杂度，并且在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明其优于其他最先进的BAI算法。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决具有可行性约束的最佳臂识别问题提供了一种高效且渐近最优的解决方案，特别适用于性能和可行性测试可以分开进行的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Best arm identification (BAI) aims to identify the highest-performance arm among a set of $K$ arms by collecting stochastic samples from each arm. In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\ell)$, where $i\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\ell\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \textit{feasible} arm with the \textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-δ$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \textit{asymptotically ($δ\rightarrow 0$) optimal}. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art BAI algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SMoFi特别适合资源受限环境下的模型训练，能有效应对数据异构性挑战。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning is a system-efficient federated learning paradigm that leverages the rich computing resources at a central server to train model partitions. Data heterogeneity across silos, however, presents a major challenge undermining the convergence speed and accuracy of the global model. This paper introduces Step-wise Momentum Fusion (SMoFi), an effective and lightweight framework that counteracts gradient divergence arising from data heterogeneity by synchronizing the momentum buffers across server-side optimizers. To control gradient divergence over the training process, we design a staleness-aware alignment mechanism that imposes constraints on gradient updates of the server-side submodel at each optimization step. Extensive validations on multiple real-world datasets show that SMoFi consistently improves global model accuracy (up to 7.1%) and convergence speed (up to 10.25$\times$). Furthermore, SMoFi has a greater impact with more clients involved and deeper learning models, making it particularly suitable for model training in resource-constrained contexts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新算法，能够绕过CSQ（相关性统计查询）的硬度障碍，在满足因子化假设的分布下，以多项式时间学习两个半空间的交集，而CSQ方法需要拟多项式时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习半空间的交集是计算学习理论中的核心问题。即使只有两个半空间，能否在多项式时间内学习仍然是一个主要开放问题。现有最佳算法需要拟多项式时间，且已证明仅依赖CSQ的方法无法避免这种复杂度。

Method: 提出了一种新算法，利用更一般的统计查询（SQ），结合改进的Jennrich算法、随机投影矩张量的PCA，以及基于梯度下降的非凸优化框架。

Result: 在满足因子化假设的分布下，CSQ方法需要拟多项式时间，而新算法实现了多项式时间学习，建立了CSQ和SQ之间的强分离。

Conclusion: 该工作通过引入新的对偶框架和算法设计，成功绕过了CSQ硬度障碍，为学习半空间交集问题提供了多项式时间解决方案。

Abstract: Learning intersections of halfspaces is a central problem in Computational Learning Theory. Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $γ$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\log(1/γ))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).
  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/γ)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.
  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习依赖高质量标注数据，但人工标注成本高昂且耗时。现有LLM标注方法质量仍不及人类水平，需要更高效的标注方案。

Method: ACT数据管道：LLM既作为标注员也作为审查员，批判性识别潜在错误，人工只审查最可疑案例。使用多模态LLM适用于NLP、CV和多模态理解领域。

Result: 在大多数基准数据集上，性能差距缩小到2%以内，同时节省高达90%的人工成本。通过实证研究得出7条提升标注质量的见解。

Conclusion: ACT流程能有效提升标注效率和质量，理论分析表明通过修改损失函数，在ACT数据上训练的模型能达到与全人工标注数据相当的性能。

Abstract: Supervised learning relies on high-quality labeled data, but obtaining such data through human annotation is both expensive and time-consuming. Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) for annotation, but LLM-generated labels still fall short of human-level quality. To address this problem, we propose the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline, where LLMs serve not only as annotators but also as judges to critically identify potential errors. Human effort is then directed towards reviewing only the most "suspicious" cases, significantly improving the human annotation efficiency. Our major contributions are as follows: (1) ACT is applicable to a wide range of domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding, by leveraging multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs). (2) Through empirical studies, we derive 7 insights on how to enhance annotation quality while efficiently reducing the human cost, and then translate these findings into user-friendly guidelines. (3) We theoretically analyze how to modify the loss function so that models trained on ACT data achieve similar performance to those trained on fully human-annotated data. Our experiments show that the performance gap can be reduced to less than 2% on most benchmark datasets while saving up to 90% of human costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码的主要限制是草稿器与验证器之间的不对齐，这会限制令牌接受并降低整体效率。预训练草稿器虽然速度较慢但接受率更高，需要改进其对齐效果。

Method: 引入轻量级动态对齐机制：从验证器隐藏状态计算转向向量，并将其注入预训练草稿器中，相比离线对齐方法如蒸馏，计算开销可忽略。

Result: 在标准采样下接受令牌数量提升高达35%，贪婪采样下提升22%，计算开销可忽略，且可适配现有架构和预训练模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升推测解码性能，兼容现有技术，便于快速采用。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates language model inference by separating generation into fast drafting and parallel verification. Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter. Compared to existing offline alignment methods such as distillation, our approach boosts the number of accepted tokens by up to 35\% under standard sampling and 22\% under greedy sampling, all while incurring negligible computational overhead. Importantly, our approach can be retrofitted to existing architectures and pretrained models, enabling rapid adoption.

TL;DR: ConSurv是首个用于生存分析的多模态持续学习方法，通过多阶段专家混合和特征约束重放解决灾难性遗忘和模态间复杂交互问题。

Motivation: 静态模型无法适应动态演变的临床环境和连续数据流，现有持续学习方法主要关注单模态输入且在生存预测中存在严重灾难性遗忘，而多模态输入能提供更全面的信息。

Method: ConSurv包含两个关键组件：多阶段专家混合(MS-MoE)和特征约束重放(FCR)。MS-MoE在网络不同学习阶段捕获任务共享和特定知识，学习模态间关系；FCR通过限制先前数据在不同层次的特征偏差来增强学习知识并减轻遗忘。

Result: 在综合评估基准MSAIL上的广泛实验表明，ConSurv在多个指标上优于竞争方法。

Conclusion: ConSurv通过创新的多模态持续学习方法有效解决了生存预测中的灾难性遗忘和复杂模态交互问题，为临床实践提供了更实用的动态模型。

Abstract: Survival prediction of cancers is crucial for clinical practice, as it informs mortality risks and influences treatment plans. However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConSurv outperforms competing methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: 通过整合技术和组织视角，本研究为构建既能按要求遗忘、又能维护隐私和公共信任的AI系统指明了路径。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models in sensitive domains has exposed a critical weakness: the inability to ensure that private information can be permanently forgotten. Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications. By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, this study outlines a pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget, while maintaining both privacy and public trust.

Motivation: 强化学习微调过程不稳定且检查点性能差异大，传统方法如验证集评估计算成本高，而依赖最终检查点无法保证性能。需要一种更有效的方法来选择最优检查点。

Method: UGCS方法通过识别高不确定性的困难问答对，并基于模型处理这些困难样本的能力来对检查点进行排序。通过计算训练窗口内top不确定样本的平均奖励来获得稳定且区分度高的信号。

Result: 在三个数据集和三个大语言模型上的实验表明，该方法能一致性地选择具有更强泛化能力的检查点，优于依赖训练或验证性能的传统策略。

Conclusion: 能够以低不确定性解决最困难任务的模型是最可靠的，基于不确定性的检查点选择方法为RL微调提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning is crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the process is notoriously unstable and exhibits high variance across model checkpoints. In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.

Conclusion: 通过有效整合和利用知识，该方法能够提高顺序任务的平均性能，产生的特征提取结果最接近上限，为持续学习建立了新的里程碑。

Abstract: Continual learning methods used to force neural networks to process sequential tasks in isolation, preventing them from leveraging useful inter-task relationships and causing them to repeatedly relearn similar features or overly differentiate them. To address this problem, we propose a fully differentiable, exemplar-free expandable method composed of two complementary memories: One learns common features that can be used across all tasks, and the other combines the shared features to learn discriminative characteristics unique to each sample. Both memories are differentiable so that the network can autonomously learn latent representations for each sample. For each task, the memory adjustment module adaptively prunes critical slots and minimally expands capacity to accommodate new concepts, and orthogonal regularization enforces geometric separation between preserved and newly learned memory components to prevent interference. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that the proposed method outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods for class-incremental learning, achieving final accuracies of 55.13\%, 37.24\%, and 30.11\%, respectively. Additional analysis confirms that, through effective integration and utilization of knowledge, the proposed method can increase average performance across sequential tasks, and it produces feature extraction results closest to the upper bound, thus establishing a new milestone in continual learning.

Abstract: Fair clustering is crucial for mitigating bias in unsupervised learning, yet existing algorithms often suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic computational complexity, rendering them impractical for large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that AFCF drastically accelerates state-of-the-art methods, which reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while maintaining strong clustering performance and fairness guarantees.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.

Conclusion: 权重修剪和核心集选择可以协同工作，通过SWaST机制实现计算效率的显著提升，同时保持或提高模型准确性。

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks rely heavily on massive model weights and training samples, incurring substantial computational costs. Weight pruning and coreset selection are two emerging paradigms proposed to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we first explore the interplay between redundant weights and training samples through a transparent analysis: redundant samples, particularly noisy ones, cause model weights to become unnecessarily overtuned to fit them, complicating the identification of irrelevant weights during pruning; conversely, irrelevant weights tend to overfit noisy data, undermining coreset selection effectiveness. To further investigate and harness this interplay in deep learning, we develop a Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring mechanism (SWaST) that alternately performs weight pruning and coreset selection to establish a synergistic effect in training. During this investigation, we observe that when simultaneously removing a large number of weights and samples, a phenomenon we term critical double-loss can occur, where important weights and their supportive samples are mistakenly eliminated at the same time, leading to model instability and nearly irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered in subsequent training. Unlike classic machine learning models, this issue can arise in deep learning due to the lack of theoretical guarantees on the correctness of weight pruning and coreset selection, which explains why these paradigms are often developed independently. We mitigate this by integrating a state preservation mechanism into SWaST, enabling stable joint optimization. Extensive experiments reveal a strong synergy between pruning and coreset selection across varying prune rates and coreset sizes, delivering accuracy boosts of up to 17.83% alongside 10% to 90% FLOPs reductions.

TL;DR: PRISM框架通过解耦架构先验，使用不同教师模型分别监督logit匹配和正则化目标，解决了传统数据集蒸馏方法中单一教师模型引入的归纳偏差问题，在ImageNet-1K上显著提升了生成数据的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据集蒸馏方法通常继承单一教师模型的归纳偏差，随着数据集规模增大，这种偏差会导致生成过度平滑、同质化的样本，降低类内多样性并限制泛化能力。

Method: PRISM框架将logit匹配和正则化目标解耦，使用不同架构的教师模型分别监督：主模型用于logit匹配，随机子集用于批归一化对齐。还引入了可扩展的跨类批次形成方案以实现快速并行合成。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，PRISM在低和中IPC机制下持续且可重复地优于单教师方法（如SRe2L）和近期多教师变体（如G-VBSM）。生成的数据显示出显著更丰富的类内多样性，特征间余弦相似度显著下降。

Conclusion: PRISM通过解耦架构先验有效解决了数据集蒸馏中的归纳偏差问题，生成了更高质量和多样性的合成数据，为大规模数据集蒸馏提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.

Result: 在七个公共基准测试上的实验表明，M$^2$V-UGAD在不同缺失率下始终优于现有的无监督图异常检测方法。

Conclusion: M$^2$V-UGAD有效解决了不完整图中的异常检测问题，通过防止跨视图干扰和减轻插补偏差，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) has received increasing attention in recent years, which aims to identify data anomalous patterns utilizing only unlabeled node information from graph-structured data. However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk "repairing" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于策略的强化学习在优化有能力的机器人策略时，常常受到噪声大、信号弱的梯度问题困扰，需要更稳定的优化方法。

Method: 重新审视进化策略作为策略梯度代理，使用有界、反三角扰动进行局部探索，提出TD-ES方法结合有界三角噪声和中心秩有限差分估计器，实现稳定、可并行化的无梯度更新。采用两阶段流程：PPO预训练后接TD-ES精炼。

Conclusion: TD-ES提供了一种简单、计算量小的路径来实现可靠的策略精炼，在保持早期样本效率的同时实现了稳健的后期增益。

Abstract: Improving competent robot policies with on-policy RL is often hampered by noisy, low-signal gradients. We revisit Evolution Strategies (ES) as a policy-gradient proxy and localize exploration with bounded, antithetic triangular perturbations, suitable for policy refinement. We propose Triangular-Distribution ES (TD-ES) which pairs bounded triangular noise with a centered-rank finite-difference estimator to deliver stable, parallelizable, gradient-free updates. In a two-stage pipeline -- PPO pretraining followed by TD-ES refinement -- this preserves early sample efficiency while enabling robust late-stage gains. Across a suite of robotic manipulation tasks, TD-ES raises success rates by 26.5% relative to PPO and greatly reduces variance, offering a simple, compute-light path to reliable refinement.

Conclusion: MDMLP-EIA通过创新的多域动态MLP架构，有效解决了传统MLP方法在时间序列预测中的关键限制，实现了优越的预测性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across diverse domains. While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Scalable and generalizable analysis of brain activity is essential for advancing both clinical diagnostics and cognitive research. Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive modality with high temporal resolution, has been widely used for brain states analysis. However, most existing EEG models are usually tailored for individual specific tasks, limiting their utility in realistic scenarios where EEG analysis often involves multi-task and continuous reasoning. In this work, we introduce EEGAgent, a general-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to schedule and plan multiple tools to automatically complete EEG-related tasks. EEGAgent is capable of performing the key functions: EEG basic information perception, spatiotemporal EEG exploration, EEG event detection, interaction with users, and EEG report generation. To realize these capabilities, we design a toolbox composed of different tools for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, etc. These capabilities were evaluated on public datasets, and our EEGAgent can support flexible and interpretable EEG analysis, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications.

Conclusion: 动态阈值策略在理论上和实践上都优于任何单一固定阈值，能够更好地平衡误报和延迟检测，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Existing drift detection methods focus on designing sensitive test statistics. They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted. Extensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including both image and tabular data, validate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) has reshaped the dynamics of digital marketing and online consumer behavior. However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.

Abstract: Tabular data is the most abundant data type in the world, powering systems in finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and beyond. As tabular datasets grow and span multiple related targets, there is an increasing need to exploit shared task information for improved multitask generalization. Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful way to improve generalization and efficiency, yet most existing work focuses narrowly on large-scale recommendation systems, leaving its potential in broader tabular domains largely underexplored. Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains. Motivated by this, we introduce MultiTab-Net, the first multitask transformer architecture specifically designed for large tabular data. MultiTab-Net employs a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating task competition. Through extensive experiments, we show that MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including large-scale recommendation data, census-like socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, spanning a wide range of task counts, task types, and feature modalities. In addition, we contribute MultiTab-Bench, a generalized multitask synthetic dataset generator that enables systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics by tuning task count, task correlations, and relative task complexity. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Armanfard-Lab/MultiTab.

Motivation: 探索如何使用物理启发的符号回归算法自动重新发现天文学中的基本方程，特别是中心方程，以验证符号回归在物理定律发现中的有效性。

Method: 使用AI Feynman符号回归算法，通过数据预处理和搜索空间限制引入观测和归纳偏置，从月球星历数据中恢复中心方程的一阶解析形式。

Conclusion: 有针对性的领域知识嵌入使符号回归能够重新发现物理定律，但在利用领域知识通过定制偏置来约束符号回归推导物理方程时仍面临挑战。

Abstract: This work explores using the physics-inspired AI Feynman symbolic regression algorithm to automatically rediscover a fundamental equation in astronomy -- the Equation of the Centre. Through the introduction of observational and inductive biases corresponding to the physical nature of the system through data preprocessing and search space restriction, AI Feynman was successful in recovering the first-order analytical form of this equation from lunar ephemerides data. However, this manual approach highlights a key limitation in its reliance on expert-driven coordinate system selection. We therefore propose an automated preprocessing extension to find the canonical coordinate system. Results demonstrate that targeted domain knowledge embedding enables symbolic regression to rediscover physical laws, but also highlight further challenges in constraining symbolic regression to derive physics equations when leveraging domain knowledge through tailored biases.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of machine learning has propelled neural networks to unprecedented success across diverse domains. In particular, multimodal learning has emerged as a transformative paradigm, leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous data streams (e.g., text, vision, audio) to advance contextual reasoning and intelligent decision-making. Despite these advancements, current neural network-based models often fall short in open-world environments characterized by inherent unpredictability, where unpredictable environmental composition dynamics, incomplete modality inputs, and spurious distributions relations critically undermine system reliability. While humans naturally adapt to such dynamic, ambiguous scenarios, artificial intelligence systems exhibit stark limitations in robustness, particularly when processing multimodal signals under real-world complexity. This study investigates the fundamental challenge of multimodal learning robustness in open-world settings, aiming to bridge the gap between controlled experimental performance and practical deployment requirements.

Conclusion: DemoTuner是首个将演示强化学习算法引入数据库参数调优的工作，通过利用文档中的调优提示有效解决了RL方法离线训练收敛慢的问题。

Abstract: The performance of modern DBMSs such as MySQL and PostgreSQL heavily depends on the configuration of performance-critical knobs. Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种量子启发的交互建模方法，通过相干聚合（求和复数振幅后平方）与不相干聚合（求和平方幅度）的对比，直接控制协同与拮抗作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将交互作用视为工程化的乘积项或灵活模型中的涌现模式，缺乏对协同/拮抗作用的直接控制。

Method: 基于Born规则，提出干涉核分类器（IKC），使用相干聚合创建干涉交叉项，并引入相干增益和干涉信息两个诊断指标。

Result: 在XOR任务上IKC优于基线方法；在真实数据上整体竞争力强但略逊于容量最大的基线；切换聚合方式能一致改善性能指标。

Conclusion: 量子启发的相干聚合为交互建模提供了机制层面的控制，相干增益验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Classical approaches often treat interaction as engineered product terms or as emergent patterns in flexible models, offering little control over how synergy or antagonism arises. We take a quantum-inspired view: following the Born rule (probability as squared amplitude), \emph{coherent} aggregation sums complex amplitudes before squaring, creating an interference cross-term, whereas an \emph{incoherent} proxy sums squared magnitudes and removes it. In a minimal linear-amplitude model, this cross-term equals the standard potential-outcome interaction contrast \(Δ_{\mathrm{INT}}\) in a \(2\times 2\) factorial design, giving relative phase a direct, mechanism-level control over synergy versus antagonism.
  We instantiate this idea in a lightweight \emph{Interference Kernel Classifier} (IKC) and introduce two diagnostics: \emph{Coherent Gain} (log-likelihood gain of coherent over the incoherent proxy) and \emph{Interference Information} (the induced Kullback-Leibler gap). A controlled phase sweep recovers the identity. On a high-interaction synthetic task (XOR), IKC outperforms strong baselines under paired, budget-matched comparisons; on real tabular data (\emph{Adult} and \emph{Bank Marketing}) it is competitive overall but typically trails the most capacity-rich baseline in paired differences. Holding learned parameters fixed, toggling aggregation from incoherent to coherent consistently improves negative log-likelihood, Brier score, and expected calibration error, with positive Coherent Gain on both datasets.

Result: 大量实验表明GraphSB显著优于现有最先进方法，且结构平衡模块可作为即插即用模块集成到现有方法中，平均提升准确率3.67%。

Conclusion: GraphSB通过解决底层图结构不平衡问题，为不平衡节点分类提供了更有效的解决方案，其结构平衡策略具有很好的通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 3.67\%.

Conclusion: SVD-NO通过近似完整核获得了高表达性，同时由于低秩结构保持了合理的计算复杂度，是一个实用的系统。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning solution operators of partial differential equa- tions (PDEs) directly from data. Existing methods, such as those based on Fourier or graph techniques, make strong as- sumptions about the structure of the kernel integral opera- tor, assumptions which may limit expressivity. We present SVD-NO, a neural operator that explicitly parameterizes the kernel by its singular-value decomposition (SVD) and then carries out the integral directly in the low-rank basis. Two lightweight networks learn the left and right singular func- tions, a diagonal parameter matrix learns the singular values, and a Gram-matrix regularizer enforces orthonormality. As SVD-NO approximates the full kernel, it obtains a high de- gree of expressivity. Furthermore, due to its low-rank struc- ture the computational complexity of applying the operator remains reasonable, leading to a practical system. In exten- sive evaluations on five diverse benchmark equations, SVD- NO achieves a new state of the art. In particular, SVD-NO provides greater performance gains on PDEs whose solutions are highly spatially variable. The code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/2noamk/SVDNO.git.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observed data is an important task, yet it becomes challenging when the data is subject to various external interferences. Most of these interferences are the additional effects of external factors on observed variables. Since these external factors are often unknown, we introduce latent variables to represent these unobserved factors that affect the observed data. Specifically, to capture the causal strength and adjacency information, we propose a new temporal latent variable structural causal model, incorporating causal strength and adjacency coefficients that represent the causal relationships between variables. Considering that expert knowledge can provide information about unknown interferences in certain scenarios, we develop a method that facilitates the incorporation of prior knowledge into parameter learning based on Variational Inference, to guide the model estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of our proposed method.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale language models by activating only a subset of specialized expert networks for each input token, thereby reducing the number of floating-point operations. However, the growing size of modern MoE models causes their full parameter sets to exceed GPU memory capacity; for example, Mixtral-8x7B has 45 billion parameters and requires 87 GB of memory even though only 14 billion parameters are used per token. Existing systems alleviate this limitation by offloading inactive experts to CPU memory, but transferring experts across the PCIe interconnect incurs significant latency (about 10 ms). Prefetching heuristics aim to hide this latency by predicting which experts are needed, but prefetch failures introduce significant stalls and amplify inference latency. In the event of a prefetch failure, prior work offers two primary solutions: either fetch the expert on demand, which incurs a long stall due to the PCIe bottleneck, or drop the expert from the computation, which significantly degrades model accuracy. The critical challenge, therefore, is to maintain both high inference speed and model accuracy when prefetching fails.

Abstract: Protein structure tokenization converts 3D structures into discrete or vectorized representations, enabling the integration of structural and sequence data. Despite many recent works on structure tokenization, the properties of the underlying discrete representations are not well understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that the successful utilization of structural tokens in a language model for structure prediction depends on using rich, pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge the semantic gap between the sequence and structural "language". The analysis of the structural vocabulary itself then reveals significant semantic redundancy, where multiple distinct tokens correspond to nearly identical local geometries, acting as "structural synonyms". This redundancy, rather than being a flaw, can be exploited with a simple "synonym swap" strategy to generate diverse conformational ensembles by perturbing a predicted structure with its structural synonyms. This computationally lightweight method accurately recapitulates protein flexibility, performing competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our study provides fundamental insights into the nature of discrete protein structure representations and introduces a powerful, near-instantaneous method for modeling protein dynamics.

TL;DR: FAQNAS是一个FLOPs感知的神经架构搜索框架，用于设计混合量子神经网络，在NISQ时代平衡准确性和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在NISQ时代，大多数混合量子神经网络仍在经典模拟器上训练，FLOPs直接决定运行时间和可扩展性，因此需要将FLOPs作为计算复杂度的实用指标。

Method: 将HQNN设计建模为多目标优化问题，明确将FLOPs纳入优化目标，在准确性和计算成本之间寻找平衡。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，量子FLOPs主导准确性改进，而经典FLOPs基本固定。Pareto最优解显示相比FLOPs不可知基线，能以显著降低的计算成本实现竞争性准确性。

Conclusion: FLOPs感知性应作为NISQ时代HQNN设计的实用标准，并为未来HQNN系统提供可扩展原则。

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs), which combine parameterized quantum circuits with classical neural layers, are emerging as promising models in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. While quantum circuits are not naturally measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), most HQNNs (in NISQ era) are still trained on classical simulators where FLOPs directly dictate runtime and scalability. Hence, FLOPs represent a practical and viable metric to measure the computational complexity of HQNNs. In this work, we introduce FAQNAS, a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework that formulates HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing accuracy and FLOPs. Unlike traditional approaches, FAQNAS explicitly incorporates FLOPs into the optimization objective, enabling the discovery of architectures that achieve strong performance while minimizing computational cost. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, Digits, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Iris) show that quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements, while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed. Pareto-optimal solutions reveal that competitive accuracy can often be achieved with significantly reduced computational cost compared to FLOPs-agnostic baselines. Our results establish FLOPs-awareness as a practical criterion for HQNN design in the NISQ era and as a scalable principle for future HQNN systems.

TL;DR: 提出了Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO)框架，通过树形动作表示和采样剪枝机制解决大规模城市网络安全博弈中的纳什均衡求解问题，克服了传统方法在大规模组合动作空间中的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 大规模城市网络安全博弈(UNSGs)由于巨大的组合动作空间，难以有效求解纳什均衡。传统PSRO方法需要计算最佳响应，但在大规模游戏中精确计算不现实，而使用强化学习近似会引入误差。现有随机优化方法也面临动作空间过大无法有效表示的问题。

Method: 提出TSO框架：1) 使用树形动作表示将整个动作空间映射到树结构；2) 将这种表示整合到损失函数中，理论上证明其等价于无偏损失函数；3) 引入采样剪枝机制减少陷入局部最优的风险。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，TSO在解决UNSGs问题上优于其他基线算法。

Conclusion: TSO框架成功弥合了随机优化范式与UNSGs需求之间的差距，为大规模城市网络安全博弈提供了有效的纳什均衡求解方案。

Abstract: Urban Network Security Games (UNSGs), which model the strategic allocation of limited security resources on city road networks, are critical for urban safety. However, finding a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in large-scale UNSGs is challenging due to their massive and combinatorial action spaces. One common approach to addressing these games is the Policy-Space Response Oracle (PSRO) framework, which requires computing best responses (BR) at each iteration. However, precisely computing exact BRs is impractical in large-scale games, and employing reinforcement learning to approximate BRs inevitably introduces errors, which limits the overall effectiveness of the PSRO methods. Recent advancements in leveraging non-convex stochastic optimization to approximate an NE offer a promising alternative to the burdensome BR computation. However, utilizing existing stochastic optimization techniques with an unbiased loss function for UNSGs remains challenging because the action spaces are too vast to be effectively represented by neural networks. To address these issues, we introduce Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO), a framework that bridges the gap between the stochastic optimization paradigm for NE-finding and the demands of UNSGs. Specifically, we employ the tree-based action representation that maps the whole action space onto a tree structure, addressing the challenge faced by neural networks in representing actions when the action space cannot be enumerated. We then incorporate this representation into the loss function and theoretically demonstrate its equivalence to the unbiased loss function. To further enhance the quality of the converged solution, we introduce a sample-and-prune mechanism that reduces the risk of being trapped in suboptimal local optima. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of TSO over other baseline algorithms in addressing the UNSGs.

Motivation: 当前后验可解释性方法存在安全漏洞，攻击者无需访问模型内部，仅通过预测和解释就能操纵解释结果，这在安全关键应用中构成严重威胁。

Method: 开发单步黑盒攻击方法，仅需模型预测和解释输出，无需模型权重或内部访问。针对saliency maps、integrated gradients和DeepLIFT SHAP等解释方法进行攻击。

Result: 攻击成功显著改变了所有测试解释方法的输出，同时保持预测概率不变。原始图像与篡改图像的结构相似性指数(SSIM)表明视觉差异难以察觉。

Conclusion: 该方法暴露了当前可解释性方法的严重脆弱性，对其在安全关键应用中的可靠性提出了质疑，需要更鲁棒的解释方法。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods are a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that aim to provide a reason for why a model behaves in a certain way. In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成模型在现实应用中的战略部署引发了负责任的AI管理担忧，特别是关于种族和性别相关刻板印象的复制和放大可能破坏组织伦理。

Method: 对五个最流行的开源模型进行实证研究，使用十个中性职业相关提示生成每个职业100张图像，共5000张图像由代表不同种族和性别的多样化人类评估者评估。

Result: 所有五个模型都编码并放大了明显的社会偏见：护理和护理角色持续被女性化，而高地位职业如企业CEO、政治家、医生和律师绝大多数由男性和主要是白人代表。还识别出模型特定模式，如QWEN-Image几乎只关注东亚输出，Kandinsky主导白人个体，SDXL分布相对更广但仍存在偏见。

Conclusion: 这些结果为AI项目经理和从业者提供了关键见解，使他们能够选择公平的AI模型和定制提示，生成符合负责任AI原则的图像。讨论了这些偏见风险，并提出了在构建负责任生成AI系统中偏见缓解的可操作策略。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are largely used in AI-powered real-world applications and value creation. However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.

Abstract: Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

Motivation: 由于多模态大语言模型日益融入日常工具和智能代理，对其可能输出不安全内容（如有毒语言、偏见图像、隐私侵犯和有害错误信息）的担忧日益增长，而当前的安全基准在模态覆盖和性能评估方面存在严重不足。

Method: 构建了包含文本、图像、音频和视频四种模态的大规模双语数据集，系统标注9个内容风险类别；提出了多维交叉风险评分(MCRS)来评估跨类别的重叠和相关性风险；开发了FairScore可解释自动化多评审加权聚合框架。

Conclusion: OutSafe-Bench为多模态内容安全评估提供了全面基准，揭示了当前模型的安全脆弱性，强调了开发更强大安全措施的必要性。

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法使用MSE损失存在两个基本缺陷：逐点误差计算无法捕捉时间关系，且未考虑数据中的固有噪声。

Method: 引入RI-Loss目标函数，通过强制残差序列与随机时间序列之间的依赖性来显式建模噪声结构，使用HSIC理论框架。

Result: 在8个真实世界基准测试和5个领先预测模型上的实验表明预测性能得到提升，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: RI-Loss通过噪声感知表示提供了更鲁棒的时间序列预测，理论分析提供了严格的优化保证。

Abstract: Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的自主智能体开发方法成本高、效率低，需要手动构建任务数据集和强化学习管道，导致数据构建成本高、探索效率低、样本利用率差。

Method: 提出了三个协同机制：自提问（好奇心驱动任务生成）、自导航（经验重用和混合策略指导提高探索效率）、自归因（基于贡献度分配差异化奖励提高样本效率）。

Result: 初步实验表明，相比传统基于强化学习的基线方法，AgentEvolver实现了更高效的探索、更好的样本利用率和更快的适应能力。

Conclusion: AgentEvolver通过整合三种机制，实现了智能体能力的可扩展、成本效益高和持续改进。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

Abstract: Accurate exploration of protein conformational ensembles is essential for uncovering function but remains hard because molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from high computational costs and energy-barrier trapping. This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and widening the applicability of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.

Motivation: 研究LayerNorm在Pre-LayerNorm和Post-LayerNorm架构中对学习和记忆化的具体影响机制。

Method: 通过消除LayerNorm参数，分析13个模型在6个视觉和语言数据集上的表现，比较不同层LayerNorm的重要性。

Result: Pre-LayerNorm中移除LayerNorm会加剧记忆化并破坏学习稳定性；Post-LayerNorm中移除LayerNorm能有效缓解记忆化，恢复真实标签学习。早期层LayerNorm最为关键。

Conclusion: LayerNorm在Transformer中扮演着塑造记忆化和学习的关键角色，其影响因架构位置而异。

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

Motivation: 解决现实应用中强化学习样本有限导致性能不佳的问题，通过状态嵌入来改善学习效果

Method: 使用量子度量编码器将状态嵌入到更紧凑的表示中，在经典数据上作为量子启发的可训练模块，在量子数据上可直接在量子硬件上实现

Result: 在三个100样本的数据集上，使用SAC和IQL算法，QME嵌入状态比原始状态平均提升116.2%(SAC)和117.6%(IQL)的最大奖励性能

Conclusion: QME通过改变状态空间的几何结构（低Δ-双曲性）显著提升有限样本条件下的离线强化学习效果，为开发高效离线RL方法提供有价值信息

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.
  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.
  We further investigate the $Δ$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $Δ$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $Δ$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.

Conclusion: 该框架为行为健康、教育和数字治疗等领域的人本应用提供了伦理对齐的强化学习方法，旨在启动关于情感感知和可信个性化系统的伦理对齐强化学习方法论讨论。

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

### [242] [Towards Leveraging Sequential Structure in Animal Vocalizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10190)
*Eklavya Sarkar,Mathew Magimai. -Doss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过向量量化和gumbel-softmax向量量化从自监督语音模型表示中提取的离散声学标记序列是否能有效捕获和利用动物发声中的时序信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数计算生物声学研究在时间轴上平均提取的帧级特征，丢弃了发声内子单元的顺序，而动物发声中的顺序结构携带重要的交流信息。

Method: 使用HuBERT嵌入生成离散声学标记序列，通过向量量化和gumbel-softmax向量量化提取表示，然后使用Levenshtein距离的k-最近邻算法进行序列分类实验。

Result: 对四个生物声学数据集的标记序列进行成对距离分析显示，它们能够区分呼叫类型和呼叫者，序列分类实验显示出合理的分类性能。

Conclusion: 向量量化的标记序列作为替代特征表示，在利用动物发声中的顺序信息方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Animal vocalizations contain sequential structures that carry important communicative information, yet most computational bioacoustics studies average the extracted frame-level features across the temporal axis, discarding the order of the sub-units within a vocalization. This paper investigates whether discrete acoustic token sequences, derived through vector quantization and gumbel-softmax vector quantization of extracted self-supervised speech model representations can effectively capture and leverage temporal information. To that end, pairwise distance analysis of token sequences generated from HuBERT embeddings shows that they can discriminate call-types and callers across four bioacoustics datasets. Sequence classification experiments using $k$-Nearest Neighbour with Levenshtein distance show that the vector-quantized token sequences yield reasonable call-type and caller classification performances, and hold promise as alternative feature representations towards leveraging sequential information in animal vocalizations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OCE-TS是一种新颖的时间序列预测方法，使用有序交叉熵损失替代传统的均方误差损失，通过概率输出量化不确定性并保持预测值的顺序关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的时间序列预测模型主要使用均方误差损失函数，这种方法无法提供不确定性估计且对异常值鲁棒性差。

Method: 将观测值离散化为有序区间，通过参数分布推导概率作为监督信号，使用线性模型预测每个时间步的概率分布，计算预测概率和真实概率的累积分布之间的有序交叉熵损失。

Result: 在七个公共时间序列数据集上与五个基准模型比较，使用MSE和MAE作为评估指标，OCE-TS始终优于基准模型。

Conclusion: 有序交叉熵损失在时间序列预测中比均方误差损失具有更好的稳定性和异常值鲁棒性，OCE-TS方法在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The code will be published.

Conclusion: FNA建立了自注意力、随机动态和几何之间的理论联系，为强大的神经科学启发的AI提供了可解释的、生物学基础的计算机制。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through Lévy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.

Conclusion: VDT方法通过领域不变特征学习和测试时训练机制，有效提升了OOC虚假信息检测的领域适应能力。

Abstract: Out-of-context misinformation (OOC) is a low-cost form of misinformation in news reports, which refers to place authentic images into out-of-context or fabricated image-text pairings. This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset NewsCLIPpings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedCure是一个创新的半异步联邦学习框架，通过联盟构建和参与感知调度来解决非IID数据下的参与偏差问题，在四个真实数据集上相比基线方法准确率提升高达5.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半异步联邦学习(SAFL)存在参与偏差问题，特别是在非IID数据分布下更加严重。分层架构将参与从单个客户端转移到客户端组，进一步加剧了这个问题。现有研究大多关注传统云-端架构，而忽视了非IID数据在云-边-客户端层次结构中对调度的关键影响。

Method: FedCure通过三个关键规则运行：(1)偏好规则：通过最大化集体利益和建立理论稳定分区来优化联盟形成；(2)调度规则：将虚拟队列技术与贝叶斯估计的联盟动态相结合；(3)资源分配规则：基于估计的联盟动态优化客户端CPU频率。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的综合实验表明，FedCure相比四个最先进的基线方法准确率提升高达5.1倍，同时显著提高效率，每轮延迟的变异系数最低为0.0223，并在不同场景下保持长期平衡。

Conclusion: FedCure通过联盟构建和参与感知调度有效缓解了非IID数据下的参与偏差问题，在准确性和效率方面都表现出显著优势，为分层联邦学习系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL) combines the efficiency of synchronous training with the flexibility of asynchronous updates, it inherently suffers from participation bias, which is further exacerbated by non-IID data distributions. More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM图推理器缺乏对图表示对称性的不变性，在不同图序列化方式下会产生不同输出，影响鲁棒性。本文系统分析了微调对编码敏感性和泛化能力的影响，并提出了图序列化的分解框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的图推理器在图表示对称性方面缺乏内置不变性，当图的节点索引、边顺序或格式发生变化时会产生不同输出，这引发了鲁棒性担忧。

Method: 提出将图序列化分解为节点标记、边编码和语法三个因素，在综合基准测试套件上评估LLM对这些因素变化的鲁棒性，并贡献了一组新的谱任务来评估微调推理器的泛化能力。

Result: 结果显示较大的（未微调）模型更鲁棒。微调降低了节点重新标记的敏感性，但可能增加对结构和格式变化的敏感性，同时不能一致地提高在未见任务上的性能。

Conclusion: LLM图推理器存在对称性不变性问题，微调在改善某些敏感性的同时可能损害其他方面的鲁棒性，且不能保证在未见任务上的泛化能力提升。

Abstract: While promising, graph reasoners based on Large Language Models (LLMs) lack built-in invariance to symmetries in graph representations. Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法为连接基于信念的增强与基于transformer的决策提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling applications across natural language processing, computer vision, and sequential decision-making. In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization. Our method presents a promising direction to bridge the gap between belief-based augmentations and transformer-based decision-making.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, they often struggle to accurately quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, limiting their broader adoption in critical real-world applications. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Deep Learning seeks to address this challenge by providing methods to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates. Although numerous techniques have been proposed, a unified tool offering a seamless workflow to evaluate and integrate these methods remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce Torch-Uncertainty, a PyTorch and Lightning-based framework designed to streamline DNN training and evaluation with UQ techniques and metrics. In this paper, we outline the foundational principles of our library and present comprehensive experimental results that benchmark a diverse set of UQ methods across classification, segmentation, and regression tasks.

Method: PITE方法定义基于相同治疗下相似个体的聚类中心作为原型，进行实例到原型的匹配，并设计多原型对齐策略使跨治疗组的匹配原型在潜在空间中接近。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，PITE优于13种最先进方法，实现了更准确和稳健的ITE估计。

Conclusion: PITE通过细粒度的原型级对齐减少分布偏移，同时保留治疗组和对照组的局部结构，为ITE估计提供了有意义的约束。

Abstract: Estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) from observational data is challenging due to confounding bias. Most studies tackle this bias by balancing distributions globally, but ignore individual heterogeneity and fail to capture the local structure that represents the natural clustering among individuals, which ultimately compromises ITE estimation. While instance-level alignment methods consider heterogeneity, they similarly overlook the local structure information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Multi-\textbf{P}rototype alignment method for \textbf{ITE} estimation (\textbf{PITE}). PITE effectively captures local structure within groups and enforces cross-group alignment, thereby achieving robust ITE estimation. Specifically, we first define prototypes as cluster centroids based on similar individuals under the same treatment. To identify local similarity and the distribution consistency, we perform instance-to-prototype matching to assign individuals to the nearest prototype within groups, and design a multi-prototype alignment strategy to encourage the matched prototypes to be close across treatment arms in the latent space. PITE not only reduces distribution shift through fine-grained, prototype-level alignment, but also preserves the local structures of treated and control groups, which provides meaningful constraints for ITE estimation. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PITE outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods, achieving more accurate and robust ITE estimation.

Conclusion: EDGC通过熵驱动的动态梯度压缩有效解决了LLM训练中的通信瓶颈问题，在保证性能的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.

Conclusion: DeMABAR算法为去中心化协作多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的对抗攻击防护方案，在多种攻击场景下均表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Decentralized cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits (DeCMA2B) considers how multiple agents collaborate in a decentralized multi-armed bandit setting. Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information. We also conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 参考分布的建议信息能显著降低学习乘积分布的样本复杂度，为有先验知识的分布学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Given i.i.d.~samples from an unknown distribution $P$, the goal of distribution learning is to recover the parameters of a distribution that is close to $P$. When $P$ belongs to the class of product distributions on the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^d$, it is known that $Ω(d/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary to learn $P$ within total variation (TV) distance $\varepsilon$. We revisit this problem when the learner is also given as advice the parameters of a product distribution $Q$. We show that there is an efficient algorithm to learn $P$ within TV distance $\varepsilon$ that has sample complexity $\tilde{O}(d^{1-η}/\varepsilon^2)$, if $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1 < \varepsilon d^{0.5 - Ω(η)}$. Here, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are the mean vectors of $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and no bound on $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1$ is known to the algorithm a priori.

Motivation: 核幂k均值存在两个关键限制：(1)完整核矩阵的计算负担限制了在大规模数据上的使用，(2)缺乏真实的质心-样本分配学习降低了噪声鲁棒性。

Method: 使用随机傅里叶特征生成高效低维特征映射，避免完整核矩阵计算；提出IP-RFF-MKPKM结合可能性隶属度和模糊隶属度的优势改进聚类分配。

Result: 在大规模数据集上的实验表明，所提方法相比现有最优方法具有更高的效率和聚类精度。

Conclusion: RFF-KPKM和IP-RFF-MKPKM有效解决了核幂k均值的计算复杂度和鲁棒性问题，并提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Kernel power $k$-means (KPKM) leverages a family of means to mitigate local minima issues in kernel $k$-means. However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and clustering accuracy of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然神经网络内部参数的波动被认为对逃离局部最小值和提高泛化能力至关重要，但学习率如何直接影响这些神经波动的动力学关系仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过使用不同学习率训练模型，分析相应的参数波动模式，并将这些波动与网络的最终准确率进行关联分析。

Conclusion: 这项工作为超参数调优和深度学习底层机制提供了更细致的理解，揭示了学习率在优化过程中的关键调节作用。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) rely on inherent fluctuations in their internal parameters (weights and biases) to effectively navigate the complex optimization landscape and achieve robust performance. While these fluctuations are recognized as crucial for escaping local minima and improving generalization, their precise relationship with fundamental hyperparameters remains underexplored. A significant knowledge gap exists concerning how the learning rate, a critical parameter governing the training process, directly influences the dynamics of these neural fluctuations. This study systematically investigates the impact of varying learning rates on the magnitude and character of weight and bias fluctuations within a neural network. We trained a model using distinct learning rates and analyzed the corresponding parameter fluctuations in conjunction with the network's final accuracy. Our findings aim to establish a clear link between the learning rate's value, the resulting fluctuation patterns, and overall model performance. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the optimization process, shedding light on how the learning rate mediates the crucial exploration-exploitation trade-off during training. This work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of hyperparameter tuning and the underlying mechanics of deep learning.

Conclusion: 模型在解释性特定扰动下的不确定性校准问题会直接影响解释质量，而ReCalX方法能有效解决这一问题，提升基于扰动的解释方法的可靠性。

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the transparency of machine-learning models in practice. However, their reliability is often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models systematically produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this directly undermines global and local explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved explanations while preserving their original predictions. Empirical evaluations across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that ReCalX consistently reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration most effectively while enhancing explanation robustness and the identification of globally important input features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用数据内在维度作为易于计算、无需模型的类别不平衡度量方法，替代传统的基于样本数量的不平衡度量，并在五个不同数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于样本数量的不平衡度量忽略了冗余样本和类别学习难度的内在差异，而基于训练损失和不确定性的复杂度量又需要训练模型。

Method: 使用数据内在维度作为模型无关的不平衡度量，并将其整合到各种不平衡缓解方法中，同时探索与样本数量度量的结合使用。

Conclusion: 数据内在维度是衡量类别不平衡的有效指标，可作为传统样本数量度量的改进替代方案。

Abstract: Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.

### [260] [Panda: Test-Time Adaptation with Negative Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10481)
*Ruxi Deng,Wenxuan Bao,Tianxin Wei,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Panda是一种基于负数据增强的测试时适应方法，通过生成破坏语义内容的负样本来抑制图像损坏相关特征，从而提升预训练视觉语言模型在图像损坏下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时适应方法采用正数据增强，但存在计算开销大和无法缓解预测偏差的问题。正数据增强在损坏输入上操作，通常无法消除损坏本身，导致模型在损坏下倾向于预测某些类别。

Method: Panda通过负数据增强生成破坏语义内容的样本：将图像分割成块并从共享块池中随机组装，这些负样本保留损坏特定特征但丢弃对象相关信号。然后从原始图像特征中减去这些负样本的平均特征，有效抑制损坏相关成分。

Result: Panda相比正数据增强方法表现更优，且能显著提升各种测试时适应方法的性能。该方法允许在批次内共享增强，计算开销极小。

Conclusion: Panda是一种有效的测试时适应方法，能够通过负数据增强抑制图像损坏相关特征，提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性，且计算效率高，可无缝集成到现有框架中。

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决序列波动性、分布外测试数据和训练数据中的异常值问题，避免神经网络产生不现实的虚假预测。

Method: 在损失函数中不仅惩罚预测与标签数据的误差，还惩罚下一个点预测与前一个点加速度预测之间的误差，在多种AR ANN架构上测试。

Result: 在道琼斯指数15年数据上，对归一化敏感的激活函数在OOD条件下显示出统计显著的改进。

Conclusion: 该架构通过弱化数据邻域邻近关系保持，解决了自回归模型中归一化破坏数据拓扑结构的问题。

Abstract: We propose loss function week enforcement of the velocity relations between time-series points in the Kinematic-Informed artificial Neural Networks (KINN) for long-term stock prediction. Problems of the series volatility, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) test data, and outliers in training data are addressed by (Artificial Neural Networks) ANN's learning not only future points prediction but also by learning velocity relations between the points, such a way as avoiding unrealistic spurious predictions. The presented loss function penalizes not only errors between predictions and supervised label data, but also errors between the next point prediction and the previous point plus velocity prediction. The loss function is tested on the multiple popular and exotic AR ANN architectures, and around fifteen years of Dow Jones function demonstrated statistically meaningful improvement across the normalization-sensitive activation functions prone to spurious behaviour in the OOD data conditions. Results show that such architecture addresses the issue of the normalization in the auto-regressive models that break the data topology by weakly enforcing the data neighbourhood proximity (relation) preservation during the ANN transformation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Holonorm作为Transformer中替代Tanh的归一化方法，解决了Tanh的正交性、线性度和失真问题，具有残差连接和非线性特性，能防止激活值爆炸并提升模型稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic Tanh(DyT)作为层归一化的替代方法存在正交性、线性度和失真问题，因此需要开发更可靠的归一化方法。

Method: 提出Holonorm方法，具有残差连接和非线性特性，虽然在一维情况下与softsign函数相似，但更适合高维张量和向量，能保持信号的正交性、方向和可逆性。

Result: Holonorm作为合适的度量方法，将所有向量映射到开单位球内，防止激活值爆炸，提升深度Transformer模型的稳定性。

Conclusion: Holonorm是softsign函数的广义形式，适合作为归一化函数，其值在0到1之间可作为百分比使用，1-Holonorm是其补集，便于模型评估理解。

Abstract: Normalization is a key point in transformer training . In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于信息论的原子数据集压缩框架，将原子环境压缩建模为最小集合覆盖问题，能够高效保留关键信息并去除冗余，在多种数据集上优于其他子采样方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习原子间势能(MLIPs)的性能依赖于训练数据集的大小和多样性，但大数据集计算成本高，小数据集可能丢失重要原子环境信息。需要一种高效的数据集压缩方法来平衡准确性和成本。

Method: 将原子数据集压缩建模为最小集合覆盖问题，通过信息论框架量化压缩效率，开发算法识别包含原始数据集最多信息的最小结构子集，同时去除冗余信息。

Result: 在GAP-20、TM23和ColabFit的64个数据集上验证，MSC方法能持续保留异常值、保持数据集多样性，在高压缩率下仍能重现力的长尾分布，优于其他子采样方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在开源QUESTS包中实现，可用于原子建模中的多种任务，包括数据子采样、异常检测和以更低成本训练改进的MLIPs，特别在低数据情况下对分布外数据具有更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) balance high accuracy and lower costs compared to density functional theory calculations, but their performance often depends on the size and diversity of training datasets. Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.

Conclusion: Oya为改进降水监测和预报提供了一条有前景的途径，通过利用全光谱观测和深度学习技术解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate precipitation estimation is critical for hydrological applications, especially in the Global South where ground-based observation networks are sparse and forecasting skill is limited. Existing satellite-based precipitation products often rely on the longwave infrared channel alone or are calibrated with data that can introduce significant errors, particularly at sub-daily timescales. This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.

Conclusion: 提出的LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv流水线为现代深度架构提供了一个可解释且计算高效的替代方案。

Abstract: We present a semi-unified sparse dictionary learning framework that bridges the gap between classical sparse models and modern deep architectures. Specifically, the method integrates strict Top-$K$ LISTA and its convex FISTA-based variant (LISTAConv) into the discriminative LC-KSVD2 model, enabling co-evolution between the sparse encoder and the dictionary under supervised or unsupervised regimes. This unified design retains the interpretability of traditional sparse coding while benefiting from efficient, differentiable training.
  We further establish a PALM-style convergence analysis for the convex variant, ensuring theoretical stability under block alternation. Experimentally, our method achieves 95.6\% on CIFAR-10, 86.3\% on CIFAR-100, and 88.5\% on TinyImageNet with faster convergence and lower memory cost ($<$4GB GPU). The results confirm that the proposed LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv pipeline offers an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for modern deep architectures.

Conclusion: 通过将非凸ℓ0球扰动空间转化为凸包分析，实现了更高效和精确的神经网络鲁棒性验证。

Abstract: Few-pixel attacks mislead a classifier by modifying a few pixels of an image. Their perturbation space is an $\ell_0$-ball, which is not convex, unlike $\ell_p$-balls for $p\geq1$. However, existing local robustness verifiers typically scale by relying on linear bound propagation, which captures convex perturbation spaces. We show that the convex hull of an $\ell_0$-ball is the intersection of its bounding box and an asymmetrically scaled $\ell_1$-like polytope. The volumes of the convex hull and this polytope are nearly equal as the input dimension increases. We then show a linear bound propagation that precisely computes bounds over the convex hull and is significantly tighter than bound propagations over the bounding box or our $\ell_1$-like polytope. This bound propagation scales the state-of-the-art $\ell_0$ verifier on its most challenging robustness benchmarks by 1.24x-7.07x, with a geometric mean of 3.16.

Abstract: Batched synthesis and testing of molecular designs is the key bottleneck of drug development. There has been great interest in leveraging biomolecular foundation models as surrogates to accelerate this process. In this work, we show how to obtain scalable probabilistic surrogates of binding affinity for use in Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO). This demands parallel acquisition functions that hedge between designs and the ability to rapidly sample from a joint predictive density to approximate them. Through the framework of Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs), we obtain scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity on top of representations taken from large structure-informed models. Key to this work is an investigation into the importance of prior networks in ENNs and how to pretrain them on synthetic data to improve downstream performance in Batch BO. Their utility is demonstrated by rediscovering known potent EGFR inhibitors on a semi-synthetic benchmark in up to 5x fewer iterations, as well as potent inhibitors from a real-world small-molecule library in up to 10x fewer iterations, offering a promising solution for large-scale drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Riemannian symmetric spaces (RSS) such as hyperbolic spaces and symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds have become popular spaces for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for building discriminative neural networks on Siegel spaces, a family of RSS that is largely unexplored in machine learning tasks. For classification applications, one focus of recent works is the construction of multiclass logistic regression (MLR) and fully-connected (FC) layers for hyperbolic and SPD neural networks. Here we show how to build such layers for Siegel neural networks. Our approach relies on the quotient structure of those spaces and the notation of vector-valued distance on RSS. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach on two applications, i.e., radar clutter classification and node classification. Our results successfully demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

Abstract: Minerals play a critical role in the advanced energy technologies necessary for decarbonization, but characterizing mineral deposits hidden underground remains costly and challenging. Inspired by recent progress in generative modeling, we develop a learning method which infers the locations of minerals by masking and infilling geospatial maps of resource availability. We demonstrate this technique using mineral data for the conterminous United States, and train performant models, with the best achieving Dice coefficients of $0.31 \pm 0.01$ and recalls of $0.22 \pm 0.02$ on test data at 1$\times$1 mi$^2$ spatial resolution. One major advantage of our approach is that it can easily incorporate auxiliary data sources for prediction which may be more abundant than mineral data. We highlight the capabilities of our model by adding input layers derived from geophysical sources, along with a nation-wide ground survey of soils originally intended for agronomic purposes. We find that employing such auxiliary features can improve inference performance, while also enabling model evaluation in regions with no recorded minerals.

Abstract: This work extends the recently introduced Alpha-Procrustes family of Riemannian metrics for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices by incorporating generalized versions of the Bures-Wasserstein (GBW), Log-Euclidean, and Wasserstein distances. While the Alpha-Procrustes framework has unified many classical metrics in both finite- and infinite- dimensional settings, it previously lacked the structural components necessary to realize these generalized forms. We introduce a formalism based on unitized Hilbert-Schmidt operators and an extended Mahalanobis norm that allows the construction of robust, infinite-dimensional generalizations of GBW and Log-Hilbert-Schmidt distances. Our approach also incorporates a learnable regularization parameter that enhances geometric stability in high-dimensional comparisons. Preliminary experiments reproducing benchmarks from the literature demonstrate the improved performance of our generalized metrics, particularly in scenarios involving comparisons between datasets of varying dimension and scale. This work lays a theoretical and computational foundation for advancing robust geometric methods in machine learning, statistical inference, and functional data analysis.

Abstract: Structured variational inference constitutes a core methodology in modern statistical applications. Unlike mean-field variational inference, the approximate posterior is assumed to have interdependent structure. We consider the natural setting of star-structured variational inference, where a root variable impacts all the other ones. We prove the first results for existence, uniqueness, and self-consistency of the variational approximation. In turn, we derive quantitative approximation error bounds for the variational approximation to the posterior, extending prior work from the mean-field setting to the star-structured setting. We also develop a gradient-based algorithm with provable guarantees for computing the variational approximation using ideas from optimal transport theory. We explore the implications of our results for Gaussian measures and hierarchical Bayesian models, including generalized linear models with location family priors and spike-and-slab priors with one-dimensional debiasing. As a by-product of our analysis, we develop new stability results for star-separable transport maps which might be of independent interest.

Abstract: Continuous-time stochastic processes underlie many natural and engineered systems. In healthcare, autonomous driving, and industrial control, direct interaction with the environment is often unsafe or impractical, motivating offline reinforcement learning from historical data. However, there is limited statistical understanding of the approximation errors inherent in learning policies from offline datasets. We address this by linking reinforcement learning to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and proposing an operator-theoretic algorithm based on a simple dynamic programming recursion. Specifically, we represent our world model in terms of the infinitesimal generator of controlled diffusion processes learned in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. By integrating statistical learning methods and operator theory, we establish global convergence of the value function and derive finite-sample guarantees with bounds tied to system properties such as smoothness and stability. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that operator-based approaches may hold promise in solving offline reinforcement learning using continuous-time optimal control.

Abstract: Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) excel at modeling continuous-time dynamics, effectively handling challenges such as irregular observations, missing values, and noise. Despite their advantages, NDEs face a fundamental challenge in adopting dropout, a cornerstone of deep learning regularization, making them susceptible to overfitting. To address this research gap, we introduce Continuum Dropout, a universally applicable regularization technique for NDEs built upon the theory of alternating renewal processes. Continuum Dropout formulates the on-off mechanism of dropout as a stochastic process that alternates between active (evolution) and inactive (paused) states in continuous time. This provides a principled approach to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of NDEs. Moreover, Continuum Dropout offers a structured framework to quantify predictive uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling at test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Continuum Dropout outperforms existing regularization methods for NDEs, achieving superior performance on various time series and image classification tasks. It also yields better-calibrated and more trustworthy probability estimates, highlighting its effectiveness for uncertainty-aware modeling.
