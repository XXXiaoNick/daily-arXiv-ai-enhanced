The concept integrates a single actively-tilting\npropeller along with 3 pendulum-like links, each carrying a propeller,\nconnected by passive universal joints to the main body. We show that this\ndesign ensures omnidirectionality while minimizing the internal forces and\nwithout resorting to overactuation (i.e., more than 6 inputs). A detailed\ndynamic model of the multi-link MAV is first developed. Afterwards, the\nanalysis identifies the equilibrium configurations and illustrates that a\nforced equilibrium exists for every pose of the MAV's main platform. In order\nto render this equilibrium asymptotically stable for the closed-loop system, a\ngeometric nonlinear controller is constructed using dynamic feedback\nlinearization and backstepping techniques with the main platform configuration\nerror being the left-trivialized error on SE(3). The stability of the\nclosed-loop system is then investigated by employing standard Lyapunov\narguments on the zero dynamics.

This paper investigates how insurers' robustness preferences shape\ncompetitive equilibrium in a dynamic insurance market. Insurers optimize their\nunderwriting and liquidity management strategies to maximize shareholder value,\nleading to equilibrium outcomes that can be analytically derived and\nnumerically solved. Compared to a benchmark without model uncertainty, robust\ninsurance pricing results in significantly higher premiums and equity\nvaluations. Notably, our model yields three novel insights: (1) The minimum,\nmaximum, and admissible range of aggregate capacity all expand, indicating that\ninsurers' liquidity management becomes more conservative. (2) The expected\nlength of the underwriting cycle increases substantially, far exceeding the\nrange commonly reported in earlier empirical studies. (3) While the capacity\nprocess remains ergodic in the long run, the stationary density becomes more\nconcentrated in low-capacity states, implying that liquidity-constrained\ninsurers require longer to recover.

A\nmajor obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is\ncatastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired\ncapabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is\nchallenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we\ninvestigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without\ncatastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging\nmemory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by\ndesign. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new\npiece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce\ninterference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We\nevaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and\nparameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We\nfind that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting\nsubstantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after\nfull finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields\nonly an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition.

We first develop a system-threat model that\nconnects QKD key generation and routing with business-layer security\nstrategies, authentication strength, refresh frequency, and delay constraints.\nBuilding on this, we formulate a key-budgeted risk minimization problem that\njointly accounts for economic risk, service-level violations, and key-budget\nfeasibility, and reveal a threshold property linking marginal security value to\nshadow prices. Case studies on a representative VPP system demonstrate that the\nproposed approach significantly reduces residual risk and SLA violations,\nenhances key efficiency and robustness, and aligns observed dynamics with the\ntheoretical shadow price mechanism."}

First, it is its computational expense-RankDice has a\ncomplexity of O(d log d) with a substantial constant factor (where d represents\nthe number of pixels), while RankIoU exhibits even higher complexity O(d^2),\nthus limiting its practical application. For instance, in LiTS, prediction with\nRankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule.\nSecond, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where\nmultiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard\nbenchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation.

To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM.

In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels.

Conventional\napproaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,\nare constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance\ndegradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the\nMultimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified\nframework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is\nthe first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology\nspecifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint\nmodelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation\nbeyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis\nof bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for\nconsolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world\nbenchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain\ngeneralisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for\nreal-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each\ncomponent. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive\nmulti-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset\nlongevity in industrial environments."}

Under such OOD conditions,\nvanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability\nthat at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across\ntraining steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.\nInspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping\nLLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with\nenvironmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this\nworld model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and\ntransition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement\nlearning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised\nfinetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the\nenvironment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy\noptimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling\nbaseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.\nExperiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku\nshow that our approach significantly improves performance.

These texts hold immense potential for\nadvancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their\nunstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts\nmake automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements\nin natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as\nequally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across\nclinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively\ngeneralize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present\nTACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to\naddress these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts\nduring training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL\ndynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual\nsamples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler\ncases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling\nmore complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including\nEnglish and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements\nacross diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission\nprediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the\nperformance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify\napproaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,\nscalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions."}

To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions.

This method utilizes LLM agents to\nautomatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and\nvisualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and\nanalysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results\nshow that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,\nrelationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas\nand tools for multi-dimensional data analysis."}

In particular, aggregating models' next-token\nprobability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be\neffective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers,\nits application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper,\nwe show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a\ncareful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of\nensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key\nfactors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models\nand consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we\npropose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively\nensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability,\nwe introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities\nspread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single\nrepresentative token.

First, we establish that the\nclassical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is\n\\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,\nexplaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this\nsetting. Next, we demonstrate that \\emph{best-of-three} preference data\nprovably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and\ncomputationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These\nresults highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning\ncorrelated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human\npreferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several\nreal-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human\npreferences."}

Code: https://github.com/ltjed/freephdlabor", "summary": "The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for\nscience suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed\nworkflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context\nmanagement that hinders long-horizon research. We present\n\\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring\n\\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a\n\\coloremph{\\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --\nusers can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific\nrequirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including\n\\textit{automatic context compaction}, \\textit{workspace-based communication}\nto prevent information degradation, \\textit{memory persistence} across\nsessions, and \\textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These\nfeatures collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run\nattempts into \\textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on\nprior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the\narchitectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable\nco-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of\nautomated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy\ninteractive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --\nfrom ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts."}

The combination is done based on an\nexplicit model for source combination, and we here use a linear combination\nmodel which is well suited, e.g., for acoustic data. We formally define such a\nmulti-stream VAE (MS-VAE) approach, derive its inference and learning\nequations, and we numerically investigate its principled functionality. The\nMS-VAE is domain-agnostic, and we here explore its ability to separate sources\ninto different streams using superimposed hand-written digits, and mixed\nacoustic sources in a speaker diarization task. We observe a clear separation\nof digits, and on speaker diarization we observe an especially low rate of\nmissed speakers.

Unstructured financial data, like news and\ntranscripts, has attracted growing attention, driven by recent advances in\nlarge language models (LLMs). This paper examines effective methods for\nleveraging multimodal factors and newsflow in return prediction and stock\nselection. First, we introduce a fusion learning framework to learn a unified\nrepresentation from factors and newsflow representations generated by an LLM.\nWithin this framework, we compare three representative methods: representation\ncombination, representation summation, and attentive representations. Next,\nbuilding on empirical observations from fusion learning, we explore the mixture\nmodel that adaptively combines predictions made by single modalities and their\nfusion. To mitigate the training instability observed in the mixture model, we\nintroduce a decoupled training approach with theoretical insights. Finally, our\nexperiments on real investment universes yield several insights into effective\nmultimodal modeling of factors and news for stock return prediction."}

We propose a \\emph{split-client} framework where gradients and\ncurvature are computed asynchronously by separate clients. This abstraction\ncaptures realistic delays and inexact Hessian updates while avoiding the manual\ntuning required by Lazy Hessian methods. Focusing on cubic regularization, we\nshow that our approach retains strong convergence guarantees and achieves a\nprovable wall-clock speedup of order $\\sqrt{\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the\nrelative time needed to compute and decompose the Hessian compared to a\ngradient step. Since $\\tau$ can be orders of magnitude larger than one in\nhigh-dimensional problems, this improvement is practically significant.\nExperiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm the theory: asynchronous\ncurvature consistently outperforms vanilla and Lazy Hessian baselines, while\nmaintaining second-order accuracy."}

Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on\ngrounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and\nproof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even\nobservations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may\nbe able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering\npotential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance\nof machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference\ntranslations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''\nfalse translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using\nsegment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to\nevaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by\nturn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in\norder than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human\nlanguages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this\nevaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to\nvalidate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to\ncorrelate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations,\nwhich are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis\nsuggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early\nstages of learning to translate."}

Those that\ndo exist typically hold only in restrictive settings: either they rely on\nregular or higher-order tensor representations, leading to impractically\nhigh-dimensional hidden spaces, or they target specialized architectures, often\nconfined to the invariant setting. This work develops a more general account.\nFor invariant networks, we establish a universality theorem under separation\nconstraints, showing that the addition of a fully connected readout layer\nsecures approximation within the class of separation-constrained continuous\nfunctions. For equivariant networks, where results are even scarcer, we\ndemonstrate that standard separability notions are inadequate and introduce the\nsharper criterion of $\\textit{entry-wise separability}$. We show that with\nsufficient depth or with the addition of appropriate readout layers,\nequivariant networks attain universality within the entry-wise separable\nregime. Together with prior results showing the failure of universality for\nshallow models, our findings identify depth and readout layers as a decisive\nmechanism for universality, additionally offering a unified perspective that\nsubsumes and extends earlier specialized results."}

Recent advances in\nscore-based diffusion methods address this problem by constructing a\ncompositional score, obtained by aggregating individual posterior scores within\nthe diffusion process. While it is natural to suspect that the accumulation of\nindividual errors may significantly degrade sampling quality as the number of\nobservations grows, this important theoretical issue has so far remained\nunexplored. In this paper, we study the compositional score produced by the\nGAUSS algorithm of Linhart et al.

We illustrate our theoretical findings on a Gaussian example,\nwhere all analytical expressions can be derived in a closed form."}
